quiet O

I O
bought O
my O
first O
one O
four O
months O
ago O
and O
returned O
it O
because O
it O
was O
shooting O
sparks O
after O
two O
months O
. O
  O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
an O
anomaly O
and O
bought O
a O
second O
one O
like O
a O
ding O
dong O
when O
first O
one O
was O
shot O
and O

I O
love O
that O
there O
is O
a O
medium O

I O
love O
this O
small O
and O
easy O
to O
carry O
hair O
dryer O
, O
ideal O
for O
traveling O
. O
I O
will O
use O
Amazon O
for O
all O
my O
shopping O
in O
the O
future O
because O
they O
provide O
excellent O
service O
. O

Already O
had O
one O
. O
Bought O
this O
2nd O
one O
for O
the O
other O
bathroom O
. O
Great O
product O
. O

Purchased O
to O
replace O
an O
older O
Conair O
1875 O
. O
  O
The O
GFCI O
plug O
on O
this O
unit O
failed O
after O
45 O
days O
of O
normal O
use O
. O
In O
the O
future O
I O
will O
look O
for O
a O
dryer O
with O
a O
UL O
safety O
listing O
. O
Too O
bad O
Conair O
is O
diluting O
their O
brand O
with O
this O
junk O
. O

Recently O
purchased O
this O
again O
to O
replace O
a O
unit O
in O
our O
bathroom O
that O
has O
been O
there O
at O
least O
6 O
years O
. O
And O
... O
that O
unit O
still O
runs O
but O
the O
thermocouple O
switch O
that O
shuts O
the O
unit O
off O
when O
it O
overheats O
has O
worn O
over O
the O
years O
and O
has O
begun O
to O
engage O
a O
little O
too O
quickly O
. O
( O
Note O
that O
not O
keeping O
the O
lint O
filter O
clean O
will O
cause O
this O
issue O
as O
well O
, O
due O
to O
restricted O
airflow O
over O
the O
thermocouple).Indeed O
, O
a O
pretty O
darn O
good O
unit O
for O
the O
money O
. O
After O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
of O
use O
( O
literally O
, O
used O
hundreds O
of O
times O
in O
that O
period O
) O
the O
ears O
or O
fingers O
that O
hold O
the O
dryer O
became O
worn O
, O
or O
loose O
, O
so O
the O
hairdryer O
would O
fall O
out O
. O
This O
was O
solved O
by O
placing O
a O
strip O
of O
Velcro O
on O
the O
inside O
of O
each O
ear O
. O
  O
Would O
have O
given O
product O
5 O
stars O
if O
this O
had O
not O
occurred O
. O
Found O
that O
this O
easy O
repair O
needs O
to O
be O
repeated O
every O
couple O
of O
years O
. O
From O
my O
experience O
, O
definitely O
would O
not O
hesitate O
to O
recommend O
. O
Conjecture O
is O
that O
those O
who O
experienced O
short O
life O
with O
this O
appliance O
may O
not O
have O
cleaned O
the O
lint O
filter O
as O
often O
as O
required O
. O
From O
personal O
experience O
I O
know O
it O
's O
easy O
to O
put O
this O
little O
chore O
off O
. O
If O
you O
have O
had O
this O
product O
only O
a O
few O
months O
and O
you O
start O
experiencing O
the O
unit O
shutting O
off O
before O
your O
hair O
is O
dry O
- O
this O
is O
the O
thing O
to O
check O
. O

Love O
it O
! O
The O
power O
, O
the O
light O
weight O
, O
the O
settings O
& O
especially O
easy O
to O
pack O
because O
it O
folds O
up O
! O
I O
have O
fibromyalgia O
and O
my O
hands O
sometimes O
will O
not O
let O
me O
hold O
things O
. O
The O
grip O
on O
this O
is O
easy O
& O
it O
's O
light O
weight O
so O
it O
does O
n't O
hurt O
to O
hold O
it O
when O
drying O
my O
hair O
. O

I O
picked O
this O
up O
on O
lightening O
deal O
as O
I O
needed O
a O
new O
blow O
dryer O
. O
It O
's O
as O
good O
as O
my O
last O
conair O
but O
a O
bit O
less O
powerful O
- O
which O
is O
fine O
for O
me O
because O
I O
could O
n't O
use O
the O
highest O
setting O
on O
my O
last O
one O
since O
it O
blew O
my O
hair O
to O
much O
- O
I O
have O
fine O
hair O
so O
it O
just O
tangled O
my O
hair O
on O
the O
highest O
setting O
. O
I O
love O
the O
retractable O
cord O
! O

It O
's O
so O
nice O
! O

Excellent O
hair O
dryer O
! O
! O
! O
! O

Less O
than O
two O
years O
of O
use O
and O
this O
thing O
just O
stopped O
working O
. O
Aggravating O
! O

Been O
using O
this O
twice O
daily O
for O
over O
a O
year O
. O
Simple O
, O
effective O
. O
You O
do O
n't O
really O
need O
anything O
more O
than O
this O
to O
make O
wet O
hair O
dry O
. O
My O
dog O
would O
probably O
give O
it O
a O
1 O
star O
review O
, O
but O
he O
is O
biased O
because O
he O
hates O
hair O
dryers O
in O
general O
. O

Works O
very O
well O
on O
my O
hair O
. O
One O
thing O
that O
stinks O
, O
though O
, O
is O
that O
the O
concentrator O
piece O
on O
the O
end O
of O
the O
hairdryer O
comes O
off O
every O
now O
and O
then O
and O
it O
can O
become O
very O
annoying O
. O

Very O
loud O
and O
sounds O
like O
an O
afterburner O
out O
of O
an O
F-16 O
. O
Blows O
hot O
and O
cold O
. O

Do O
not O
buy O
this O
dryer O
! O
  O
After O
using O
it O
for O
less O
than O
one O
week O
, O
the O
handle O
would O
become O
so O
incredibly O
hot O
I O
could O
barely O
hold O
on O
to O
it O
. O
  O
I O
noticed O
that O
the O
protective O
covering O
had O
started O
to O
dimple O
and O
come O
apart O
. O
I O
continued O
using O
it O
being O
very O
careful O
where O
I O
put O
my O
hand O
on O
the O
handle O
. O
Now O
, O
after O
less O
than O
one O
month O
, O
it O
quit O
working O
all O
together O
. O
It O
shut O
off O
after O
smelling O
very O
hot O
and O
will O
not O
turn O
back O
on O
. O
  O
Junk O
! O

Had O
this O
product O
for O
several O
years O
and O
wore O
it O
out O
. O
Sure O
glad O
it O
was O
still O
available O
. O
Does O
the O
job O
better O
than O
most O
. O

Excellent O
dryer O
! O
  O
I O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone O

This O
is O
a O
very O
well O
built O
little O
dryer O
and O
works O
well O
. O

It O
's O
a O
tad O
heavier O
than O
I O
would O
like O
but O
I O
love O
the O
retractable O
cord O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
folds O
and O
fits O
easily O
in O
my O
vanity O
drawer O
. O
It O
does O
a O
great O
job O
. O

Excellent O
. O
Great O
Value O
. O
I O
love O
to O
retractable O
cord- O
folding O
aspects O
of O
this O
dryer O
. O
I O
put O
I O
'd O
away O
neatly O
in O
a O
drawer O
/ O
out O
of O
sight O
. O

Great O
price O
for O
an O
adequate O
hair O
dryer O
. O

Great O
diffuser O

Used O
this O
hair O
dryer O
in O
England O
last O
month O
. O
It O
worked O
fine O
with O
the O
adapter O
. O
My O
problem O
with O
this O
hair O
dryer O
is O
that O
even O
on O
the O
low O
setting O
the O
air O
from O
the O
dryer O
is O
too O
hot O
. O
I O
dry O
my O
hair O
in O
sections O
and O
I O
could O
hardly O
get O
a O
section O
dry O
before O
my O
scalp O
would O
start O
to O
burn O
. O

This O
blowdryer O
works O
well O
although O
not O
as O
powerful O
as O
the O
Revlon O
one O
I O
am O
replacing O
this O
with O
. O
  O
It O
dries O
my O
hair O
in O
a O
fair O
amount O
of O
time O
but O
I O
miss O
being O
able O
to O
hold O
onto O
the O
hairdryer O
and O
being O
able O
to O
turn O
it O
on O
and O
off O
one O
handed O
. O
  O
The O
curved O
handle O
on O
this O
does O
not O
allow O
you O
to O
do O
this O
. O
  O
Other O
than O
that O
I O
like O
it O
and O
I O
like O
the O
retractable O
cord O
although O
the O
cord O
could O
be O
a O
tad O
longer O
. O

Awesome O

Bought O
for O
my O
Mother O
, O
and O
it O
does O
what O
it O
is O
supposed O
to O
do O
. O

good O
hair O
dryer O
! O
  O
10mins O
to O
dry O
my O
long O
hair O
! O
I O
am O
so O
happy O

Purchased O
the O
Onei O
MK O
- O
II O
to O
replace O
my O
wigo O
. O
After O
purchasing O
a O
Chi O
& O
Sedu O
I O
was O
hesitant O
to O
purchase O
the O
Onei O
. O
This O
by O
far O
has O
surpassed O
my O
expectations O
& O
my O
experience O
with O
the O
Chi O
& O
Sedu O
. O
I O
need O
a O
hairdryer O
to O
meet O
my O
needs O
: O
dry O
without O
loss O
of O
volume O
& O
decrease O
amount O
/ O
use O
of O
root O
/ O
shine O
styling O
products O
. O
Very O
surprised O
at O
how O
gentle O
the O
air O
flow O
comes O
out O
& O
how O
fast O
my O
hair O
dries O
. O
  O
I O
assume O
it O
's O
based O
on O
the O
barrel O
shape O
of O
the O
Onei O
dryer O
vs O
a O
more O
cylindrical O
barrel O
like O
some O
dryers O
. O
The O
packaging O
of O
the O
dryer O
far O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
. O
The O
quality O
of O
the O
Onei O
feels O
/ O
looks O
better O
than O
the O
sedu O
I O
purchased O
months O
ago O
. O
So O
far O
very O
surprised O
& O
looking O
to O
see O
if O
this O
will O
outlast O
my O
last O
dryer O
a O
wigo(5yrs O
) O
. O
  O
I O
have O
had O
this O
dryer O
for O
only O
a O
month O
& O
have O
not O
heard O
of O
this O
brand O
before O
. O
That O
's O
why O
I O
only O
gave O
it O
a O
4 O
. O
So O
far O
loving O
it O
better O
than O
the O
Sedu O
& O
Chi O
. O

Ionizes O
and O
retracts O
. O
It O
has O
great O
power O
. O

OMG O
, O
I O
have O
been O
looking O
for O
this O
dryer O
for O
at O
least O
5 O
years O
! O
  O
After O
my O
favorite O
dryer O
broke O
, O
I O
looked O
for O
one O
like O
it O
that O
is O
lightweight O
, O
has O
power O
but O
not O
too O
much O
power O
, O
and O
most O
importantly O
, O
has O
the O
high O
/ O
low O
/ O
off O
switch O
on O
the O
BACK O
of O
the O
dryer O
handle O
, O
not O
in O
the O
front O
. O
  O
All O
of O
the O
dryers O
I O
have O
looked O
at O
in O
the O
past O
have O
the O
switch(es O
) O
on O
the O
front O
of O
the O
handle O
. O
  O
This O
is O
a O
problem O
for O
me O
, O
because O
when O
I O
style O
my O
hair O
with O
a O
dryer O
and O
a O
round O
brush O
, O
I O
have O
to O
constantly O
turn O
the O
dryer O
on O
and O
off O
. O
  O
With O
the O
buttons O
on O
the O
back O
of O
the O
handle O
like O
this O
one O
, O
I O
can O
turn O
it O
on O
and O
off O
with O
one O
hand O
. O
  O
When O
the O
buttons O
are O
on O
the O
front O
of O
the O
handle O
, O
I O
have O
to O
set O
my O
brush O
down O
to O
turn O
it O
on O
and O
off O
with O
two O
hands O
. O
  O
What O
a O
hassle O
! O
  O
This O
lightweight O
dryer O
with O
the O
on O
/ O
off O
switch O
on O
the O
back O
of O
the O
handle O
fits O
the O
bill O
perfectly O
. O
  O
I O
will O
probably O
buy O
another O
one O
as O
a O
back O
- O
up O
for O
when O
this O
one O
wears O
out O
. O
  O
I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
dryer O
, O
and O
you O
ca O
n't O
beat O
the O
price O
! O

Good O
! O

These O
little O
dryers O
are O
just O
great O
in O
my O
room O
and O
the O
guest O
room O
. O
Small O
enough O
to O
be O
out O
of O
the O
way O
but O
plenty O
of O
power O
to O
dry O
my O
thick O
hair O
. O
My O
guests O
love O
them O

Great O
service O
. O
I O
just O
wish O
that O
I O
had O
realized O
that O
the O
barrel O
is O
so O
long O
. O
My O
wife O
has O
a O
short O
arm O
  O
and O
has O
difficulty O
using O
the O
dryer O
. O

Bought O
the O
leopard O
version O
of O
this O
blow O
dryer O
because O
of O
the O
cheaper O
price O
and O
I O
LOVE O
it O
. O
It O
is O
a O
great O
blowdryer O
and O
I O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
every O
hair O
stylist O
. O
UPDATE O
: O
now O
7 O
- O
8 O
months O
later O
my O
blowdryer O
is O
broken O
. O
I O
really O
loved O
this O
blowdryer O
but O
mine O
just O
stopped O
work O
and O
only O
blows O
cold O
air O
now O
. O
Very O
disappointing O
. O

I O
like O
the O
warm O
and O
cool O
feature O
! O
Diffuser O
attachment O
an O
added O
bonus O

Replacement O
dryer O
for O
the O
original O
one O
I O
broke O
. O
Love O
it O
. O

It O
works O
OK O
. O
Easy O
to O
use O
. O
Nothing O
special O
about O
it O
. O
  O
It O
says O
for O
salon O
use O
but O
, O
it O
would O
take O
to O
long O
to O
dry O
Salon O
hair O
. O
I O
had O
a O
salon O
use O
blow O
dryer O
and O
it O
dried O
my O
hair O
much O
faster O
but O
the O
price O
was O
around O
$ O
200 O
to O
replace O
it O
. O
  O
so O
, O
for O
the O
price O
of O
the O
MHD O
dryer O
it O
works O
just O
fine O
. O
It O
just O
takes O
longer O
. O

Great O
dryer O
! O
! O
! O
The O
directions O
were O
not O
made O
for O
people O
who O
have O
no O
idea O
what O
they O
are O
doing O
, O
so O
it O
tooke O
about O
a O
month O
or O
so O
to O
actually O
put O
it O
together O
! O
! O
  O
But O
I O
got O
it O
and O
I O
love O
it O
. O
I O
would O
just O
say O
, O
put O
in O
better O
instructions O
to O
follow O
. O

as O
expected O

excellent O

This O
thing O
is O
a O
miracle O
worker O
. O
My O
curls O
have O
never O
look O
bigger O
and O
bouncier O
! O

I O
bought O
this O
hair O
dryer O
because O
it O
's O
dual O
voltage O
and O
I O
needed O
something O
for O
a O
trip O
to O
Italy O
. O
  O
It O
worked O
wonderfully O
in O
Europe O
. O
  O
And O
it O
's O
working O
great O
at O
home O
too O
. O
  O
Nice O
and O
powerful O
. O

very O
happy O
with O
the O
unit O
. O

Works O
very O
well O
. O
You O
only O
have O
to O
be O
careful O
with O
lid O
which O
is O
much O
thinner O
than O
the O
lower O
half O
. O

Fantastic O
product O
.. O
Save O
time O
each O
morning O
with O
this O
amazing O
product O

I O
purchased O
this O
hair O
dryer O
on O
February O
27th O
. O
The O
heating O
element O
stopped O
working O
on O
June O
3rd O
( O
so O
it O
worked O
for O
only O
3 O
months O
. O
) O
It O
will O
blow O
air O
, O
but O
not O
hot O
air O
. O
Returns O
not O
allowed O
after O
30 O
days O
. O

I O
really O
like O
this O
hair O
dryer O
! O
Although O
it O
's O
a O
bit O
heavy O
on O
my O
hands O
as O
I O
'm O
using O
it O
, O
it O
leaves O
my O
hair O
looking O
shiny O
and O
smooth O
with O
minimal O
frizz O
. O
It O
also O
dries O
my O
hair O
efficiently O
and O
quickly O
. O
Highly O
recommend O
it O
and O
it O
's O
at O
a O
great O
price O
! O
! O

This O
sounds O
weird O
, O
but O
the O
night O
light O
is O
MUCH O
TOO O
BRIGHT O
. O
  O
I O
had O
to O
tape O
something O
over O
it O
to O
mute O
the O
light O
. O
  O
The O
mounting O
bracket O
is O
tricky O
to O
install O
and O
kind O
of O
flimsy O
too O

A O
little O
heavy O
on O
the O
hand O
but O
works O
well O
. O

I O
wish O
this O
one O
had O
the O
Ionic O
feature O
that O
my O
other O
one O
has O
, O
which O
seems O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
a O
lot O
faster O
, O
but O
still O
a O
great O
compact O
dryer O
that O
is O
a O
great O
addition O
to O
my O
bathroom O
! O

Was O
tired O
of O
hair O
dryers O
that O
died O
after O
3 O
years O
so O
I O
purchased O
this O
. O
  O
It O
died O
after O
4 O
MONTHS O
! O
  O
the O
heating O
element O
broke O

  O
Very O

flawlessly O
for O
months O

Not O

had O
10 O
years O
ago O
. O
The O
old O

was O
a O
better O
quality O
and O
this O
make O
hair O
a O
little O
frizzy O

Excellent O
. O

My O
teen O
age O
son O
was O
leaving O
his O
previous O
dryer O
laying O
on O
the O
sink O
. O
  O
Sometimes O
the O
cord O
would O
be O
IN O
the O
sink O
! O
  O
This O
freaked O
me O
out O
a O
bit O
so O
I O
ordered O
this O
wall O
unit O
. O
  O
This O
was O
easy O
and O
quick O
to O
install O
. O
  O
I O
love O
it O
! O
  O
My O

This O
hair O
dryer O
died O
within O
4 O
months O
of O
buying O
it O
. O
Waste O
of O
money O
. O

Does O
not O
blow O
hard O
enough O
for O
me O
. O
Bought O
a O
different O
brand O
and O
it O
works O
great O
! O

Love O
, O
love O
, O
love O
this O
little O
hair O
dryer O
! O
I O
got O
it O
because O
it O
tucked O
into O
my O
smallish O
bathroom O
cabinet O
but O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
how O
well O
it O
worked O
. O
It O
has O
at O
least O
as O
much O
power O
as O
the O
full O
size O
dryer O
I O
am O
replacing O
. O
I O
have O
n't O
missed O
the O
old O
one O
for O
a O
minute O
. O
Plus O
, O
as O
promised O
, O
this O
has O
a O
very O
compact O
size O
that O
makes O
storage O
and O
travel O
easy O
. O

Very O
easy O
purchase O
. O
Dryer O
works O
great O
. O
Totally O
satisfied O
customer O
. O

Received O
exactly O
when O
promised O
. O
Product O
is O
exactly O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
and O
met O
or O
exceeded O
expectations O
. O

This O
hairdryer O
is O
the O
best O
I O
have O
had O
! O
! O
! O
  O
It O
is O
much O
better O
than O
even O
my O
$ O
125 O
hairdryer O
. O

This O
is O
now O
my O
favorite O
hair O
dryer O
. O
I O
use O
it O
every O
day O
. O
It O
's O
so O
light O
my O
wrist O
does O
n't O
get O
tired O
. O

This O
dryer O
does O
the O
job O
, O
but O
it O
's O
a O
little O
loud O
, O
and O
it O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
get O
as O
hot O
as O
my O
last O
dryer O
. O
  O
It O
takes O
a O
little O
longer O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
, O
but O
at O
the O
price O
I O
paid O
, O
it O
was O
still O
a O
good O
value O
. O
  O
I O
've O
had O
it O
for O
many O
months O
and O
it O
still O
works O
fine O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
little O
dryer O
from O
another O
vendor O
. O
Normally O
it O
takes O
me O
a O
good O
40 O
minutes O
to O
get O
my O
hair O
mostly O
dry O
and O
I O
air O
dry O
the O
rest O
with O
quite O
a O
bit O
of O
frizz O
. O
This O
little O
hair O
dryer O
is O
very O
lightweight O
, O
comfortable O
to O
hold O
and O
dried O
my O
hair O
nearly O
complete O
after O
just O
5 O
minutes O
with O
no O
frizz O
. O
I O
returned O
it O
. O
The O
problem O
is O
, O
this O
is O
literally O
the O
loudest O
hair O
dryer O
I O
have O
ever O
come O
across O
. O
Really O
loud O
. O
I O
felt O
like O
I O
had O
hearing O
issues O
for O
about O
15 O
minutes O
afterward O
. O
Granted O
I O
have O
severe O
migraines O
and O
am O
super O
sensitive O
to O
noise O
. O
I O
love O
the O
job O
it O
did O
, O
I O
just O
wish O
it O
did O
it O
more O
quietly O
. O
I O
could O
not O
imaging O
turning O
this O
on O
while O
traveling O
, O
camping O
, O
staying O
at O
someone O
's O
house O
. O
Too O
bad O

Dries O
as O
it O
should O
with O
aesthetic O
looks O
. O

I O
waited O
6 O
mos O
to O
write O
this O
review O
because O
I O
wanted O
to O
be O
sure O
it O
atleast O
lasted O
that O
long O
. O
This O
thing O
is O
perfect O
for O
home O
use O
. O
I O
use O
it O
on O
myself O
and O
my O
daughter O
. O
roller O
sets O
come O
out O
perfect O
. O
twistouts O
dry O
in O
half O
the O
time O
wash O
and O
go O
's O
have O
less O
shrinkage O
because O
the O
gel O
cast O
sets O
faster O
. O
I O
'm O
so O
glad O
i O
ordered O
this O
product O
. O
It O
is O
top O
heavy O
when O
you O
try O
and O
roll O
it O
I O
support O
the O
bottom O
and O
top O
as O
I O
push O
but O
it O
mainly O
stays O
in O
one O
spot O
. O
The O
bell O
can O
be O
a O
bit O
startling O
but O
mainly O
because O
you O
tune O
out O
the O
sound O
of O
the O
dryer O
so O
when O
the O
timer O
goes O
off O
you O
've O
forgotten O
what O
you O
were O
doing O
. O
i O
do O
nt O
find O
it O
necessary O
to O
crank O
the O
heat O
all O
the O
way O
up O
, O
at O
mid O
range O
my O
hair O
is O
dry O
in O
about O
40min O
. O
In O
Short O
... O
I O
love O
this O
dryer O
and O
if O
anything O
happened O
to O
it O
I O
would O
gladly O
purchase O
again O
. O
I O
ordered O
my O
dryer O
the O
week O
of O
Christmas O
it O
was O
on O
my O
doorstep O
the O
next O
day O

The O
dryer O
blows O
cold O
air O
on O
US O
settings O
! O
Worthless O
unless O
you O
're O
traveling O
abroad O
! O

Works O
perfectly O
. O

Excellent O
product O

Buyer O
beware O
! O
  O
I O
have O
owned O
this O
hair O
dryer O
less O
than O
9 O
months O
. O
  O
While O
drying O
my O
5 O
year O
old O
daughter O
's O
hair O
it O
shut O
off O
. O
  O
We O
thought O
we O
just O
needed O
to O
reset O
it O
on O
the O
plug O
. O
  O
After O
doing O
that O
and O
turning O
it O
back O
on O
we O
heard O
a O
loud O
snap O
. O
  O
It O
burned O
through O
the O
cord O
near O
the O
handle O
and O
left O
black O
marks O
on O
my O
husband O
's O
hand O
. O
  O
Thank O
goodness O
my O
daughter O
was O
n't O
hurt O
. O
  O
What O
a O
dangerous O
piece O
of O
garbage O
. O

Being O
a O
guy O
I O
never O
saw O
a O
need O
for O
a O
hair O
dryer O
, O
but O
recently O
I O
found O
it O
gives O
me O
a O
ton O
of O
volume O
( O
Duh O
) O
. O
This O
is O
a O
great O
buy O
and O
the O
attachment O
works O
wonders O
during O
styling O
. O
Not O
to O
mention O
, O
if O
you O
are O
a O
hairy O
guy O
, O
it O
makes O
the O
drying O
process O
of O
the O
rest O
of O
your O
body O
a O
lot O
easier O
! O

Really O
good O
dryer O
but O
now O
its O
seriously O
overpriced O
. O
Bought O
ours O
on O
Amazon O
in O
March O
for O
only O
$ O
32 O
. O
Totally O
worth O
every O
penny O
, O
however O
totally O
NOT O
worth O
$ O
200 O
. O
Not O
sure O
where O
the O
price O
increase O
came O
from O
..... O

Better O
than O
my O
old O
one O
. O
This O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
faster O
and O
a O
lot O
quieter O
. O

I O
read O
the O
reviews O
on O
this O
hair O
dryer O
and O
decided O
to O
give O
it O
a O
try O
. O
Going O
on O
a O
big O
trip O
and O
definitely O
needed O
a O
small O
travel O
size O
dryer O
. O
This O
hairdryer O
is O
amazing O
for O
its O
size O
. O
  O
I O
have O
fine O
hair O
but O
a O
lot O
of O
it O
and O
this O
thing O
works O
great O
great O
, O
it O
's O
amazing O
for O
its O
size O
how O
much O
power O
it O
has O
. O
I O
have O
a O
very O
expensive O
Ionic O
ceramic O
dryer O
and O
this O
thing O
dries O
my O
hair O
just O
as O
well O
. O
I O
've O
actually O
even O
started O
using O
it O
on O
an O
every O
day O
basis O
and O
for O
the O
price O
you O
can O
not O
go O
wrong O
! O

It O
drys O
my O
hair O
quickly O
and O
is O
n't O
too O
large O
or O
heavy O
to O
use O
. O
I O
wish O
it O
had O
a O
hanging O
loop O
on O
th O
handle O
, O
and O
it O
is O
a O
little O
on O
the O
noisy O
side O

Great O
product O
and O
amazing O
price O

I O
know O
there O
have O
been O
a O
lot O
of O
positive O
reviews O
on O
this O
hairdryer O
but O
the O
one O
that O
I O
purchased O
just O
blew O
up O
. O
  O
Purchased O
in O
February O
of O
2015 O
and O
can O
no O
longer O
use O
it O
in O
the O
end O
of O
May O
2015 O
( O
three O
months O
) O
. O
  O
My O
girlfriend O
and O
myself O
were O
using O
it O
daily O
for O
the O
three O
months O
but O
I O
would O
think O
it O
would O
last O
longer O
than O
that O
. O
  O
Trying O
to O
reach O
out O
to O
the O
manufacturer O
now O
to O
get O
replaced O
but O
this O
is O
a O
hassle O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
deal O
with O
. O
If O
we O
get O
it O
replaced O
, O
I O
'll O
change O
my O
rating O

Everyone O
that O
comes O
over O
comments O
: O
“ O
WHERE O

” O

works O
great O
, O
I O
use O
it O
every O
single O
morning O
and O
also O
with O
some O
craft O
projects O
. O
it O
’s O
easy O
to O
use O
and O
i O
love O
love O
love O
how O
you O
just O
shove O
it O
in O
it O
’s O
holster O
( O
like O
slamming O
an O
old O
telephone O
haha O
) O
very O
satisfying O
because O
it O
turns O
OFF O
when O
you O
put O
it O
in O
its O
home O
. O
Love O
that O
about O
it O
. O
I O
also O
like O
the O
position O
of O
the O
grip O
. O
I O
mounted O
mine O
onto O
tile O
with O
two O
3 O
M O
heavy O
duty O
adhesive O
strips O
so O
we O
did O
n’t O
have O
to O
drill O
holes O
. O
It O
’s O
holding O
up O
well O
and O
when O
it O
is O
time O
to O
take O
it O
off O
, O
you O
just O
slide O
the O
base O
off O
it O
’s O
mount O
and O
work O
with O
it O
directly O
. O
Great O
buy O

Works O
great O
. O
My O
wife O
really O
liked O
it O
for O
Mother O
's O
Day O
. O
Its O
dries O
her O
hair O
faster O
than O
her O
old O
one O
. O

Light O
too O
bright O

This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
light O
, O
quiet O
, O
and O
best O
of O
all O
, O
the O
cord O
swoops O
right O
up O
into O
the O
body O
of O
the O
dryer O
with O
the O
push O
of O
a O
button O
. O
I O
love O
, O
love O
, O
LOVE O
this O
feature O
. O

The O
bonnet O
is O
not O
quite O
big O
enough O
for O
large O
rollers O
, O
so O
the O
heat O
does O
not O
circulate O
well O
. O
  O
I O
'm O
still O
looking O
for O
the O
old O
- O
fashioned O
hat O
box O
dryers O
that O
I O
had O
in O
the O
60 O
's O
. O

Love O
it O
! O
! O
! O
! O
I O
've O
had O
it O
for O
couple O
of O
months O
now O
. O
Definitely O
recommend O
it O
. O

Great O

This O
is O
the O
WORST O
hair O
dryer O
that O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
. O
The O
one O
that O
Andis O
quit O
making O
, O
and O
I O
guess O
replaced O
it O
with O
this O
thing O
, O
was O
SOOOOOOO O
much O
better O
than O
this O
punny O
thing O
. O
Anything O
can O
blow O
harder O
than O
this O
one O
, O
it O
's O
terrible O
. O
The O
nozzle O
( O
I O
guess O
that O
's O
what O
you O
call O
it O
) O
anyway O
where O
the O
air O
comes O
out O
is O
so O
big O
around O
, O
what O
little O
air O
that O
comes O
out O
goes O
everywhere O
and O
you O
ca O
n't O
style O
your O
hair O
with O
it O
. O
Seems O
as O
though O
when O
a O
company O
comes O
up O
with O
a O
good O
product O
and O
it O
sells O
good O
, O
they O
ca O
n't O
stand O
it O
, O
and O
then O
they O
come O
up O
with O
something O
in O
it O
's O
place O
that O
is O
terrible O
and O
they O
think O
people O
should O
except O
their O
stupidity O
for O
making O
such O
a O
mess O
of O
things O
. O
I O
have O
had O
Andis O
wall O
hair O
dryers O
for O
years O
and O
loved O
them O
but O
, O
this O
one O
is O
the O
poorest O
excuse O
for O
a O
hair O
dryer O
that O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
Thank O
You O
, O
Louise O
Bell O

Very O
good O
hair O
dryer O
. O
Mounting O
bracket O
works O
very O
good O
. O

Worked O
great O
until O
it O
broke O
8.5 O
months O
in O
. O

I O
shopped O
around O
for O
a O
blow O
dryer O
and O
was O
about O
to O
buy O
one O
for O
well O
over O
100 O
dollars O
when O
I O
came O
across O
this O
one O
... O
so O
I O
thought O
I O
would O
give O
it O
a O
chance O
. O
  O
I O
am O
happy O
to O
say O
that O
I O
love O
it O
. O
  O
The O
chord O
is O
nice O
and O
long O
, O
the O
buttons O
are O
easy O
to O
set O
and O
do O
not O
sit O
in O
an O
area O
where O
they O
are O
in O
the O
way O
. O
  O
The O
cold O
shot O
button O
must O
be O
held O
down O
but O
it O
shoots O
out O
a O
nice O
cold O
blast O
of O
air O
to O
help O
set O
your O
hair O
. O
  O
The O
hot O
setting O
is O
super O
hot O
but O
I O
am O
sure O
works O
well O
with O
thick O
hair O
. O
  O
I O
mostly O
use O
the O
medium O
heat O
without O
any O
damage O
. O

I O
hairdresser O
recommended O
this O
blow O
dryer O
to O
me O
she O
said O
it O
was O
the O
strongest O
and O
best O
she O
has O
ever O
used O
, O
she O
was O
right O
. O
  O
I O
'm O
pretty O
sure O
they O
use O
this O
blow O
dryer O
in O
the O
movie O
Twister O
to O
make O
the O
tornadoes O
. O

Works O
great O

I O
work O
for O
a O
salon O
that O
provides O
you O
with O
everything O
but O
your O
shears O
and O
I O
HATED O
the O
blow O
dryer O
they O
provide O
. O
I O
went O
to O
Cosmoprof O
and O
saw O
that O
this O
model O
was O
on O
sale O
and O
I O
decided O
to O
give O
it O
a O
shot O
thinking O
if O
I O
hate O
it O
I O
can O
always O
trade O
it O
in O
and O
get O
something O
else O
and O
since O
this O
was O
one O
of O
the O
more O
expensive O
models O
I O
'd O
get O
a O
small O
refund O
as O
well O
. O
The O
first O
client O
I O
had O
I O
noticed O
a O
huge O
difference O
, O
no O
frizzy O
hair O
and O
it O
does O
the O
job O
in O
half O
of O
the O
time O
than O
my O
other O
blowdryer O
. O
( O
Also O
, O
to O
fellow O
cosmetologists O
, O
I O
recommend O
the O
power O
styler O
from O
Daroko O
to O
use O
with O
your O
blowdryer)This O
is O
definitely O
a O
case O
of O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
. O
This O
blow O
dryer O
is O
worth O
the O
money O
. O
If O
you O
are O
ok O
the O
beauty O
industry O
this O
is O
a O
great O
investment O
. O

LOVE O
this O
hairdryer O
! O
! O
I O
keep O
getting O
compliments O
on O
my O
hair O
lately O
and O
the O
only O
thing O
I O
've O
done O
differently O
is O
to O
start O
using O
this O
blow O
dryer O
( O
with O
no O
cut O
or O
professional O
styling O
in O
months O
) O
! O
The O
small O
diffuser O
was O
a O
tight O
fit O
at O
first O
, O
but O
the O
more O
I O
've O
used O
it O
, O
the O
easier O
it O
's O
gotten O
. O
I O
guess O
the O
little O
tabs O
had O
to O
be O
rubbed O
down O
a O
bit O
. O
Never O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
curling O
diffuser O
. O
2 O
months O
in O
and O
am O
satisfied O
so O
far O
! O

I O
sent O
it O
back O
. O
  O
Basically O
not O
worth O
it O
. O
  O
Heavy O
- O
cord O
did O
not O
retract O
all O
the O
way O
-- O
not O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
. O

Good O
product O

Works O
fine O
but O
at O
their O
higher O
price O
no O
longer O
a O
good O
buy O

This O
hairdryer O
does O
not O
get O
very O
hot O
. O
On O
high O
heat O
it O
blows O
warm O
/ O
cool O
on O
the O
low O
blow O
setting O
. O
Even O
on O
the O
high O
heat O
and O
high O
blow O
setting O
it O
is O
only O
warm O
. O
  O
It O
takes O
longer O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
with O
this O
than O
my O
10 O
year O
old O
Panteen O
hair O
dryer O
. O
No O
reduction O
in O
frizz O
. O
I O
bought O
this O
on O
amazon O
but O
I O
saw O
this O
exact O
hairdryer O
at O
dollar O
general O
for O
$ O
15 O
. O
  O
It O
is O
ok O
. O
I O
would O
n't O
buy O
it O
again O
. O

fit O
my O
old O
wall O
mount O
- O
works O
great O
! O

The O
mounting O
screws O
that O
screw O
the O
base O
to O
the O
mounting O
plate O
are O
really O
tiny O
and O
flimsy O
. O
One O
of O
the O
two O
screws O
stripped O
its O
thread O
right O
away O
when O
it O
was O
being O
slightly O
tighten O
. O
It O
's O
a O
shame O
that O
a O
good O
product O
fails O
for O
something O
so O
simple O
. O

this O
product O
did O
not O
work O
at O
all O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
newand O
fine O
but O
never O
went O
on O

This O
hair O
dryer O
left O
my O
hair O
a O
tangeled O
mess O
each O
time O
I O
used O
it O
. O
  O
I O
will O
be O
returning O
and O
going O
back O
to O
a O
conair O
or O
revlon O
hair O
dryer O
. O

The O
best O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
In O
fact O
this O
was O
a O
replacement O
for O
the O
one O
I O
had O
for O
ten O
years O

Works O
great O
, O
gave O
me O
my O
independence O
back O
. O

I O
read O
the O
reviews O
and O
decided O
to O
try O
this O
. O
  O
Maybe O
BaByliss O
spoiled O
me O
I O
dunno O
. O
My O
hair O
is O
way O
too O
dry O
and O
does O
nt O
hold O
its O
shape O
. O
Returning O
and O
sticking O
with O
BaByliss O
. O

Love O
this O

Love O
it O
! O
  O
Does O
not O
frizz O
out O
my O
hair O
at O
all O
in O
fact O
it O
smooths O
it O
really O
well O
and O
gives O
me O
that O
just O
went O
to O
the O
salon O
look O
. O

This O
is O
my O
second O
Andis O
wall O
mounted O
hair O
dryer O
, O
which O
replaced O
one O
that O
was O
over O
5 O
years O
old O
. O
  O
Of O
course O
, O
the O
wall O
mount O
feature O
is O
the O
best O
for O
keeping O
a O
clutter O
- O
free O
countertop O
, O
but O
I O
also O
appreciate O
that O
it O
is O
quiet O
and O
has O
the O
power O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
quickly O
. O
  O
( O
I O
have O
thick O
, O
shoulder O
length O
hair O
. O
) O

The O
on O
/ O
off O

heat O
selector O
buttons O
are O
not O
toggle O
or O
rocker O
switch O
like O
other O
ones O
it O
seems O
to O
wobble O
when O
operated O
and O
feel O
it O
might O
not O
last O
as O
long O
as O
others O
. O
  O
I O
do O
not O
use O
often O
but O
others O
in O
family O
will O
. O
  O
Will O
have O
to O
see O
how O
it O
wears O
. O

just O
like O
we O
use O
when O
we O
travel O
( O
Mariott O

) O

Very O

Quietiest O

. O
  O
Very O
powerful O
, O
drys O
quickly O
and O
efficiently O
. O
  O
Love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
! O

Nice O
product O
, O
but O
never O
got O
the O
diffuser O
it O
was O
supposed O
to O
come O
with O
. O

Does O
n't O
fold O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O

I O
absolutely O
love O
this O
dryer O
! O
The O
buttons O
are O
easy O
to O
use O
, O
the O
concentrator O
nozzle O
keeps O
my O
hair O
smooth O
and O
it O
dries O
in O
half O
the O
time O
! O
I O
would O
buy O
this O
again O
! O

Wife O
did O
n't O
really O
like O
it O
. O
Was O
n't O
impressed O
. O
Works O
fine O
though O
. O

Overheats O
REALLY O
easy O
:( O
It O
is O
light O
, O
small O
, O
cute O
and O
works O
ok O
apart O
from O
that O
... O
I O
would O
also O
prefer O
the O
tip O
thinner O

Great O
product O
quiet O
like O
I O
've O
never O
experienced O
I O
forget O
it O
's O
on O
if O
I O
walk O
away O
from O
it O
! O
LolGets O
really O
hot O
so O
be O
careful O
to O
adjust O
or O
sit O
low O
.. O
best O
dryer O
ever O
and O
I O
've O
owned O
7 O

I O
’m O
better O
impressed O
with O
the O
Curlipops O
Diffuser O
Dryer O
than O
I O
was O
with O
my O
deceased O
Conair O
Curl O
Fusion O
Ionic O
Ceramic O
Styler O
Hair O
Dryer O
( O
next O
to O
current O
generation O
) O
which O
the O
Curlipops O
is O
replacing O
for O
me O
. O
Both O
dryers O
have O
negative O
ionic O
technology O
, O
which O
makes O
them O
preferable O
to O
the O
free O
hairdryers O
at O
hotels O
, O
the O
gym O
, O
and O
my O
therapy O
pool O
, O
as O
I O
always O
notice O
much O
more O
frizz O
when O
I O
use O
those O
dryers O
than O
when O
I O
use O
my O
own O
. O
So O
, O
in O
that O
regard O
, O
they O
’re O
both O
preferable O
IMO.Unlike O
the O
Conair O
, O
the O
Curlipops O
allows O
you O
to O
position O
the O
diffuser O
the O
way O
you O
want O
to O
, O
and O
for O
me O
that O
’s O
so O
that O
there O
are O
n’t O
large O
gaps O
between O
the O
dryer O
fan O
and O
your O
hair O
. O
It O
may O
be O
that O
I O
have O
a O
heightened O
sense O
of O
safety O
awareness O
, O
after O
working O
in O
health O
care O
for O
38 O
years O
, O
but O
the O
Conair O
’s O
clipping O
on O
in O
a O
way O
that O
kept O
the O
gaps O
as O
wide O
as O
possible O
did O
n’t O
give O
me O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
confidence O
that O
it O
would O
work O
well O
for O
“ O

” O
For O
those O
who O
do O
n’t O
know O
, O
this O
is O
a O
method O
of O
drying O
curly O
hair O
, O
developed O
by O
someone O
who O
goes O
by O
“ O
pixiecurl O
” O
on O
naturallycurly.com O
, O
in O
which O
you O
scrunch O
your O
hair O
into O
the O
bowl O
of O
a O
dryer O
’s O
diffuser O
with O
the O
dryer O
off O
, O
turn O
it O
on O
and O
dry O
that O
section O
of O
hair O
, O
then O
turn O
it O
off O
before O
repositioning O
the O
dryer O
: O
because O
the O
dryer O
is O
n’t O
on O
when O
you O
do O
the O
scrunching O
, O
curls O
stay O
better O
defined O
, O
but O
another O
factor O
is O
that O
your O
hair O
is O
n’t O
being O
pushed O
away O
by O
airflow O
when O
you O
’re O
positioning O
the O
dryer O
, O
only O
possibly O
an O
issue O
with O
a O
pancake O
style O
dryer O
. O
I O
was O
still O
too O
chicken O
to O
try O
it O
with O
pixiecurling O
, O
but O
used O
the O
method O

# O
60 O
; O
and O
it O
worked O
great O
! O
My O
hair O
dried O
a O
lot O
faster O
, O
curled O
really O
well O
, O
and O
I O
had O
no O
problems O
with O
frizz O
as O
it O
finished O
drying O
. O
Although O
it O
’s O
a O
little O
difficult O
to O
attach O
initially O
, O
the O
diffuser O
works O
really O
well O
, O
and O
that O
’s O
no O
biggie O
since O
I O
have O
no O
reason O
to O
keep O
removing O
and O
reattaching O
it O
, O
it O
just O
resides O
on O
the O
dryer O
. O
So O
one O
for O
Curlipops O
. O
It O
has O
three O
heat O
settings O
: O
cool O
, O
warm O
, O
and O
hot O
, O
which O
are O
independent O
of O
the O
airflow O
speed O
, O
as O
well O
as O
having O
a O
cool O
shot O
button O
. O
I O
do O
n’t O
use O
high O
speed O
because O
it O
disorganizes O
my O
curls O
. O
I O
’m O
also O
unlikely O
to O
use O
hot O
, O
but O
it O
’s O
nice O
to O
have O
the O
option O
of O
finishing O
with O
cool O
air O
without O
having O
to O
hold O
the O
cool O
shot O
button O
down O
for O
an O
extended O
period O
of O
time O
. O
The O
Conair O
has O
Hi O
, O
Off O
, O
and O
Lo O
, O
along O
with O
a O

so O
airspeed O

or O
lack O
thereof O
, O
are O
connected O

other O

I O
score O
another O
one O
for O
the O
Curlipops O

Whine O
: O
the O
Conair O
has O
it O
in O
spades O
, O
and O
the O
Curlipops O
has O
very O
little O
. O
So O
I O
give O
this O
one O
to O
the O
Curlipops O
too O
. O
Both O
dryers O
are O

Nice O
blower O
. O

This O
dryer O
is O
amazing O
! O
It O
works O
better O
than O
the O
shop O
dryers O
. O
It O
's O
super O
quiet O
besides O
the O
timer O
tick O
but O
even O
the O
tick O
is O
less O
noisy O
than O
the O
shop O
dryer O
.. O
me O
and O
my O
clients O
can O
carry O
on O
a O
conversation O
and O
they O
can O
enjoy O
watching O
t.v O
. O
This O
dryer O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
in O
all O
areas O
and O
it O
was O
also O
very O
easy O
to O
assemble O
. O
The O
shipping O
was O
also O
awesome O
it O
arrived O
within O
3 O
days O
from O
ordering O
it O
. O
I O
recommend O
this O
dryer O
to O
anyone O
. O

I O
have O
thick O
hair O
and O
this O
baby O
gets O
my O
hair O
dry O
quickly O
and O
WITHOUT O
frizzies O
! O
Love O
it O
! O

This O
dryer O
is O
so O
light O
weight O
! O
! O
I O
was O
amazing O
by O
that O
. O
It O
is O
perfect O
for O
what O
I O
needed O
. O

Does O
what O
it O
is O
supposed O
to O
. O
A O
noted O
design O
flaw O
... O
the O
hose O
connector O
to O
the O
bonnet O
does O
not O
couple O
well O
, O
or O
rather O
stay O
connected O
. O
I O
suggest O
that O
you O
shove O
the O
male O
hose O
part O
into O
the O
female O
bonnet O
part O
, O
without O
using O
the O
notches O
. O
It O
may O
permanently O
attach O
the O
tow O
so O
you O
can O
no O
longer O
use O
the O
brush O
or O
detach O
them O
, O
but O
it O
will O
keep O
the O
two O
secure O
. O
  O
Also O
it O
kind O
of O
smells O
weird O
when O
on O
. O

Bought O
dryer O
for O
my O
daughter O
it O
is O
n't O
hot O
enough O
for O
me O
but O
awesome O
for O
my O
10yr O
old O
to O
dry O
her O
thin O
/ O
fine O
hair O
with O

Fits O
a O
need O
, O
but O
not O
as O
nicely O
made O
as O
the O
model O
it O
replaced O
. O
The O
base O
is O
all O
molded O
plastic O
and O
is O
not O
really O
integrated O
with O
the O
hair O
dryer O
. O
What O
I O
mean O
is O
that O
there O
are O
two O
notches O
cut O
in O
to O
the O
plastic O
base O
and O
the O
hair O
dryer O
cord O
is O
run O
through O
the O
notches O
with O
some O
rubber O
grommets O
used O
to O
hold O
the O
cord O
in O
place O
. O
There O
are O
not O
a O
lot O
of O
alternative O
products O
to O
choose O
from O
and O
on O
the O
plus O
side O
it O
was O
relatively O
cheap O
and O
easy O
to O
install O
. O

I O
have O
very O
thick O
and O
coarse O
hair O
and O
this O
is O
the O
best O
hairdryer O
I O
have O
owned O
until O
now O
! O
It O
gets O
my O
hair O
dry O
so O
fast O
, O
and O
the O
end O
results O
are O
smooth O
and O
frizzless O
hair O
. O
With O
other O
hair O
dryers O
it O
takes O
anywhere O
from O
25 O
- O
35 O
minutes O
but O
this O
one O
literally O
takes O
7 O
- O
10 O
minutes O
plus O
adds O
more O
volume O
to O
my O
hair O
. O
The O
heat O
settings O
are O
perfect O
as O
well O
in O
case O
someone O
does O
n't O
want O
to O
add O
too O
much O
heat O
to O
your O
hair O
.. O
Every O
dryer O
I O
have O
ever O
owned O
did O
pretty O
much O
all O
the O
same O
things O
but O
at O
the O
end O
made O
my O
hair O
frizzy O
and O
dried O
my O
hair O
out O
. O
This O
dryer O
is O
THE O
ONLY O
ONE O
that O
makes O
my O
hair O
look O
so O
beautiful O
, O
sleek O
, O
soft O
and O
shiny O
! O
It O
makes O
my O
hair O
so O
smooth O
that O
I O
almost O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
flat O
iron O
it O
since O
it O
is O
naturally O
wavy O
. O
Freakinglyyy O
amazing O
! O
! O

Good O
merchandise O
for O
the O
price O
. O
A++ O

Great O
power O
, O
compact O
shape O
, O
easy O
to O
use O
. O
This O
is O
for O
my O
regular O
daily O
use O
because O
the O
small O
size O
fits O
under O
my O
sink O
but O
is O
powerful O
enough O
to O
blow O
out O
my O
hairstyle O
every O
day O
. O

I O
got O
this O
as O
a O
gift O
to O
my O
mom O
and O
she O
love O
it O
! O
! O
! O
! O

SUPER O
tiny O
but O
works O
great O
. O
Perfect O
for O
weekend O
trips O
away O
from O
home O
and O
small O
enough O
to O
toss O
in O
a O
bag O
and O
take O
to O
the O
gym O
. O
Not O
terribly O
noisy O
either O
. O
I O
wish O
it O
had O
a O
medium O
heat O
setting O
but O
other O
than O
that O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
complain O
. O

I O
love O
it O
. O
No O
more O
clutter O
in O
the O
bathroom O
. O

I O
like O
tha O
it O
has O
the O
hot O
and O
warm O
heat O
adjustment O
. O
  O
Works O
great O
. O

Of O
the O
two O
blow O
dryers O
that O
I O
own O
, O
this O
attachment O
fits O
neither O
. O

Bad O
smell O
come O
out O
. O

Great O
hairdryer O
! O

My O
favorite O
hair O
dryer O
, O
powerful O
, O
totally O
recommended O
! O

A O
lot O
of O
power O
. O
  O
Heavier O
than O
some O
hair O
dryers O
that O
I O
have O
previously O
owned O
. O
  O
Does O
n't O
get O
as O
hot O
as O
I O
would O
like O
it O
to O
, O
but O
still O
styles O
your O
hair O
effectively O
. O

Good O
value O
I O
am O
very O
happy O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
from O
Amazon O
warehouse O
deals O
, O
so O
it O
was O
a O
few O
dollars O
cheaper O
. O
The O
only O
thing O
it O
did O
n't O
have O
was O
a O
box O
. O
Everything O
else O
was O
there O
, O
and O
working O
. O
There O
was O
no O
damage O
to O
the O
item O
itself O
. O
This O
hair O
dryer O
runs O
a O
bit O
quieter O
and O
smoother O
than O
my O
previous O
one O
, O
and O
has O
both O
the O
concentrator O
and O
diffuser O
, O
and O
cold O
shot O
, O
so O
I O
'm O
set O
. O
It O
's O
light O
too O
, O
so O
if O
you O
spend O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
using O
it O
your O
wrist O
and O
hand O
wo O
n't O
get O
as O
tired O
. O
Great O
buy O
for O
the O
price O
. O
Better O
than O
the O
$ O
30 O
one O
I O
bought O
at O
Sally O
Beauty O
. O

So O
this O
blow O
dryer O
has O
a O
purple O
hint O
of O
color O
just O
an O
fyi O
and O
love O
it O
. O
I O
used O
it O
for O
the O
first O
time O
because O
my O
other O
blow O
dryer O
would O
cause O
a O
lot O
of O
split O
ends O
, O
instantly O
. O
So O
I O
used O
it O
for O
the O
first O
time O
and O
no O
split O
ends O
, O
yay O
! O
. O
I O
also O
did O
use O
another O
blow O
out O
product O
with O
this O
blow O
dryer O
which O
you O
should O
try O
to O
prevent O
split O
ends O
. O
I O
use O
the O
RedKen O
Satinwear O
Blow O
dry O
Lotion O
before O
I O
start O
blow O
drying O
and O
both O
combined O
work O
wonders O
. O
Your O
hair O
will O
look O
like O
you O
just O
came O
out O
of O
the O
salon O
. O

This O
is O
actually O
a O
pretty O
darned O
good O
blow O
dryer O
for O
the O
price O
. O
  O
Just O
wish O
the O
cord O
was O
longer O
. O

good O
product O

Work O
well O
and O
has O
great O
heat O
. O
I O
can O
dry O
my O
hair O
very O
fast O

Love O
the O
hot O
pink O
! O
  O
Different O
speeds O
and O
heat O
settings O
are O
fantastic O

THE O
BEST O
HAIR O
DRYER O
EVER O
! O
My O
children O
are O
biracial O
so O
I O
have O
to O
find O
products O
that O
can O
accompany O
their O
individual O
hair O
textures O
. O
My O
daughter O
has O
coarse O
thick O
hair O
whereas O
my O
son O
has O
thin O
straight O
hair O
. O
This O
dryer O
works O
for O
both O
of O
them O
efficiently O
. O
Works O
FAST O
! O
Do O
n't O
need O
a O
flat O
iron O
for O
my O
daughter O
since O
this O
gets O
it O
pretty O
straight O
while O
drying O
. O
Cuts O
time O
in O
half O
. O
Bought O
based O
on O
good O
reviews O
and O
I O
now O
Highly O
recommend O
it O
myself O
! O
  O
Try O
it O
and O
you O
'll O
never O
want O
a O
different O
hair O
dryer O
. O

I O
love O
the O
amount O
of O
air O
it O
produces O
and O
the O
multiple O
heat O
and O
blow O
settings O
! O

This O
is O
a O
very O
decent O
little O
hair O
dryer O
: O
very O
inexpensive O
, O
two O
speeds O
and O
heats O
, O
but O
it O
packs O
punch O
for O
its O
size O
. O
I O
wish O
it O
were O
some O
other O
color O
( O
not O
a O
huge O
fan O
of O
pink O
) O
, O
but O
I O
am O
very O
satisfied O
with O
this O
purchase O
. O

bigger O
than O
I O
expected O
, O
does O
n't O
fit O
in O
my O
drawer O
. O
  O
but O
the O
product O
itself O
works O
great O
. O

Very O
good O
for O
the O
price O
. O
Gets O
super O
hot O
so O
you O
have O
to O
be O
careful O
. O

Would O
have O
preferred O
a O
stronger O
airflow O

Love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
It O
dries O
my O
hair O
faster O
than O
others O
and O
makes O
my O
hair O
soft O
. O

Exactly O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
! O
Here O
's O
hoping O
it O
lives O
a O
long O
and O
service O
- O
oriented O
life O
. O

Best O
hair O
dryer O
I O
have O
ever O
owned O
! O

Absolute O
bargain O
of O
the O
century O
! O
My O
wife O
had O
two O
Chi O
's O
break O
in O
the O
course O
of O
around O
five O
years O
. O
While O
most O
would O
argue O
that O
2 O
- O
3 O
years O
is O
adequate O
- O
when O
one O
pays O
$ O
100 O
+ O
for O
a O
hairdryer O
, O
you O
expect O
to O
see O
many O
long O
years O
of O
service O
. O
Instead O
of O
sinking O
another O
hundo O
into O
what O
is O
just O
a O
high O
priced O
Chinese O
made O
hair O
dryer O
, O
we O
took O
a O
gamble O
on O
the O
Herstyler O
Pro O
. O
The O
result O
? O
My O
wife O
is O
101 O
% O
pleased O
- O
really O
. O
FIt O
and O
finish O
is O
as O
good O
as O
the O
Chi O
. O
Logical O
button O
placement O
and O
function O
is O
perfect O
. O
Temps O
are O
ideal O
, O
force O
is O
great O
and O
the O
whole O
hairdryer O
feels O
like O
a O
salon O
professional O
. O
They O
could O
double O
the O
price O
and O
it O
would O
still O
be O
a O
steal O
. O
VERY O
well O
done O
. O
I O
like O
it O
so O
much O
, O
we O
are O
buying O
a O
second O
to O
stick O
on O
the O
shelf O
if O
the O
first O
ever O
gives O
up O
the O
ghost O
. O

Much O
smaller O
than O
anticipated O
- O
not O
sure O
what O
they O
measured O
for O
the O
dimensions O
. O
It O
is O
also O
fairly O
weak O
if O
you O
have O
thicker O
hair O
. O

Would O
give O
zero O
stars O
if O
allowed O
. O
The O
day O
it O
arrived O
, O
took O
it O
out O
of O
the O
box O
, O
plugged O
in O
and O
nothing O
. O
Just O
a O
big O
puff O
of O
smoke O
that O
smelled O
awful O
. O
Unplugged O
and O
it O
continued O
to O
smoke O
. O
Very O
disappointed O
in O
this O
. O
Thought O
I O
have O
found O
a O
trusted O
manufacturer O
and O
decently O
priced O
hair O
dryer O
. O
Back O
it O
went O
for O
return O
. O

Good O

Bought O
this O
for O
my O
daughter O
. O
  O
She O
loves O
it O
, O
except O
there O
is O
no O
diffuser O
but O
she O
has O
managed O
. O

Love O
it O
. O
Not O
to O
hot O
, O
drys O
my O
hair O
quickly O
and O
my O
hair O
looks O
fab O
. O
What O
more O
could O
I O
ask O
for O
. O
I O
'm O
glad O
I O
did O
not O
get O
one O
of O
the O
more O
pricey O
dryers O
. O

Works O
very O
well O
and O
fast O
. O
I O
have O
medium O
long O
wavy O
hair O
. O
It O
looks O
very O
healthy O
after O
blow O
drying O
without O
even O
any O
product O
. O
I O
am O
saving O
a O
lot O
by O
not O
having O
to O
use O
products O
in O
my O
hair O
anymore O
. O

Very O
good O
quality O
product O
for O
good O
price O

Perfect O

This O
thing O
had O
sparks O
coming O
out O
of O
it O
, O
so O
I O
called O
Panasonic O
and O
they O
said O
that O
these O
were O
made O
for O
use O
in O
Japan O
. O
They O
say O
100Volts O
on O
them O
. O
Look O
at O
all O
your O
other O
hair O
dyers O
and O
electrical O
appliances O
. O
They O
usually O
say O
120V O
or O
125V.I've O
copied O
and O
pasted O
this O
from O
a O
blog O
where O
someone O
asked O
if O
you O
can O
use O
Japanese O
appliances O
in O
the O
U.S. O
: O
Can O
you O
use O
Japanse O
appliances O
in O
the O
US?I O
am O
an O
electrical O
engineer O
. O
My O
expert O
opinion O
is O
I O
would O
stay O
away O
from O
using O
any O
appliance O
that O
generates O
heat O
... O
such O
as O
a O
hairdryer O
( O
as O
previously O
mentioned O
) O
or O
a O
kotatsu O
or O
a O
boiler O
for O
tea O
water O
... O
unless O
you O
know O
what O
you O
are O
doing!!Japan O
's O
electrical O
system O
is O
roughly O
the O
same O
as O
the O
US O
's O
. O
However O
, O
the O
US O
's O
voltage O
is O
120Vac O
RMS O
( O
60Hz)while O
Japan O
's O
is O
100Vac O
RMS O
( O
50 O
or O
60Hz O
depending O
on O
region).So O
, O
any O
heat O
generating O
device O
from O
Japan O
that O
is O
used O
in O
the O
US O
will O
get O
20 O
% O
hotter O
than O
it O
's O
design O
intended O
. O
The O
risk O
is O
damage O
to O
the O
device O
and/or O
fire O
... O
or O
injury O
of O
a O
person O
. O
Please O
be O
careful!!That O
being O
said O
, O
you O
could O
use O
a O
transformer O
for O
such O
devices O
if O
you O
really O
must O
have O
them O
. O
But O
, O
heat O
generating O
devices O
are O
usually O
pretty O
high O
wattage O
... O
meaning O
you O
'd O
need O
some O
pretty O
hefty O
transformers O
to O
do O
the O
job O
. O
We O
do O
have O
another O
of O
these O
dryers O
that O
's O
a O
slightly O
different O
model O
that O
has O
n't O
sparked O
, O
but O
knowing O
what O
I O
know O
now O
, O
I O
would O
n't O
buy O
another O
. O
I've O
put O
a O
link O
below O
to O
a O
similar O
dryer O
that O
's O
Conair O
brand O
that O
we O
've O
bought O
before O
and O
which O
is O
what O
I O
'm O
replacing O
this O
unit O
with O
. O
There O
may O
be O
other O
brands O
; O
just O
look O
for O
hair O
straightening O
dryer O
or O
something O
like O
that O
. O

I O
have O
had O
a O
couple O
of O
these O
over O
the O
years O
. O
  O
They O
've O
been O
great O
. O
  O
Lasted O
a O
long O
time O
. O
  O
Easy O
to O
mount O
. O
  O
Great O
night O
light O
too O
. O

Great O
dryer O
, O
easy O
to O
hold O
, O
made O
really O
well O
, O
drys O
hair O
in O
no O
time O
at O
all O

My O
old O
blow O
dryer O
broke O
and O
I O
needed O
a O
quick O
replacement O
. O
  O
The O
price O
seemed O
reasonable O
and O
it O
was O
a O
quick O
delivery O
. O
  O
The O
hair O
dryer O
is O
flimsy O
and O
the O
nozzle O
continues O
to O
fall O
off O
from O
day O
one O
. O
  O
I O
never O
had O
the O
time O
to O
pack O
it O
up O
and O
send O
it O
back O
. O
Bad O
me O
for O
not O
returning O
it O
. O

Amazing O
value O
! O

Very O
nice O
hairdryer O
. O
Wishing O
the O
size O
is O
smaller O
though O
. O

Great O
little O
travel O
dryer O
. O
  O
Super O
strong O
for O
the O
size O
! O

I O
use O
this O
to O
style O
my O
epic O
beard O
. O
It O
is O
great O
. O
The O
only O
down O
side O
I O
can O
thik O
of O
is O
the O
attachment O
only O
fits O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
This O
is O
a O
great O
hair O
dryer O
at O
a O
great O
price O
. O

It O
dries O
so O
fast O
it O
is O
great O
! O
I O
had O
brought O
one O
over O
from O
France O
that O
my O
mom O
had O
gotten O
years O
and O
years O
ago O
but O
unfortunately O
I O
was O
never O
able O
to O
get O
the O
same O
power O
due O
to O
the O
voltage O
difference O
. O
I O
ordered O
this O
one O
and O
it O
is O
the O
same O
to O
the O
T O
( O
except O
color O
) O
. O
Cut O
down O
my O
hair O
routine O
in O
half O
. O
It O
does O
fume O
and O
heats O
up O
A O
LOT O
so O
be O
careful!(I O
have O
black O
relaxed O
hair O
) O

Purchased O
several O
of O
these O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
. O
Gave O
one O
as O
a O
gift O
and O
my O
wife O
kept O
one O
. O
She O
loved O
hers O
, O
so O
when O
she O
recently O
gave O
it O
to O
our O
daughter O
she O
bought O
this O
one O
as O
a O
replacement O
. O
My O
wife O
likes O
the O
size O
, O
power O
and O
temperature O
of O
this O
hair O
dryer O
and O
rates O
it O
5 O
stars O
. O

Best O
hair O
dryer O
I O
've O
used O
. O
Light O
weight O
and O
dries O
hair O
fast O
. O

Love O
it O
, O
lots O
of O
power O
and O
drys O
my O
hair O
quickly O

Used O
this O
dryer O
during O
a O
recent O
trip O
to O
Europe O
. O
  O
So O
easy O
to O
use O
in O
different O
countries O
and O
compact O
to O
carry O
. O
Could O
n't O
ask O
for O
a O
better O
, O
more O
efficient O
dryer O
. O
  O
I O
even O
used O
it O
to O
warm O
cold O
food O
in O
my O
hotel O
room O
, O
but O
do O
n't O
tell O
anybody O
. O

Works O
well O

Works O
beautifully O
and O
fast O
. O
  O
Lots O
of O
heat O
choices O
. O
  O
Hot O
is O
hot O
with O
this O
dryer O
. O
  O
I O
had O
to O
wear O
a O
terry O
headband O
around O
my O
forehead O
, O
ears O
, O
neck O
because O
of O
the O
leakage O
of O
hot O
air O
, O
but O
otherwise O
, O
it O
dried O
my O
curly O
hair O
very O
quickly O
, O
almost O
as O
fast O
as O
at O
the O
salon O
. O
  O
Love O
the O
thin O
case O
and O
the O
way O
the O
power O
cord O
, O
bonnet O
and O
air O
hose O
store O
in O
the O
case O
. O
  O
I O
worried O
about O
where O
I O
'd O
store O
this O
in O
a O
small O
apartment O
, O
but O
it O
's O
no O
problem O
. O

Great O
deal O
. O
Love O
it O
except O
it O
is O
a O
little O
heavy O
. O

Works O
great O
and O
keeps O
my O
daughter O
from O
borrowing O
my O
wife O
's O
all O
the O
time O
. O

Good O
product O
. O
Received O
quickly O
. O
As O
expected O
. O

Dries O
my O
hair O
quicker O
than O
my O
older O
one O
. O
  O
A O
little O
heavy O
though O

My O
wife O
really O
liked O
this O
product O
it O
's O
good O

Great O
product O
, O
fast O
delivery O
and O
reasonable O
price O
! O
Highly O
recommended O
! O

I O
've O
had O
this O
blow O
dryer O
for O
about O
six O
months O
. O
It O
dries O
, O
it O
's O
strong O
, O
but O
I O
keep O
smelling O
a O
slight O
burn O
scent O
and O
I O
feel O
like O
it O
's O
just O
about O
ready O
to O
bite O
the O
dust O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
really O
even O
blow O
dry O
my O
hair O
that O
often O
. O
Also O
, O
it O
claims O
to O
be O
ionic O
but O
my O
hair O
is O
totally O
frizzy O
after O
using O
it O
, O
so O
it O
seems O
like O
just O
a O
buzz O
word O
on O
this O
product O
. O
You O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
. O
I O
'll O
be O
shopping O
for O
a O
more O
quality O
product O
. O

Underpowered O
. O

This O
is O
our O
second O
wall O
mounted O
hair O
dryer O
and O
I O
can O
see O
some O
improvements O
in O
the O
design O
. O
  O
We O
are O
very O
happy O
with O
its O
performance O
. O

I O
know O
everyone O
has O
said O
this O
dryer O
is O
awesome O
blah O
blah O
blah O
. O
I O
normally O
love O
Andis O
products O
, O
but O
this O
has O
ended O
their O
winning O
streak O
with O
me O
. O
I O
purchased O
this O
for O
deep O
conditions O
and O
to O
style O
my O
hair O
roller O
sets O
, O
twists O
etc O
. O
This O
bonnet O
is O
so O
small O
it O
only O
fit O
on O
my O
7yr O
olds O
head O
and O
that O
was O
a O
tight O
fit O
. O
I O
really O
tried O
to O
make O
it O
work O
but O
after O
I O
knocked O
all O
my O
pink O
rollers O
loose O
, O
everyone O
got O
a O
hearty O
laugh O
I O
gave O
up O
. O
  O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
they O
used O
small O
models O
for O
the O
design O
or O
maybe O
I O
need O
a O
plus O
size O
head O
bonnet O
either O
way O
it O
was O
a O
return O
for O
me O
. O

Super O
powerful O
and O
versatile O
! O

WHY O

THE O
ONLY O
BLOW O
DRYER O
THAT O
REALLY O
WORKS O
ON O
MY O
HAIR O

DOESN'T O
BREAK O
OR O
BLOW O
OUT O
WHILE O
DEALING O
WITH O
MY O
THICK O
HAIR O

I O
ONLY O

WAS O
MORE O
STRONGER O

IT O
CAME O
IN O
PINK O
:) O
  O
OTHER O
THAN O
THAT O
NO O
COMPLAINTS O
! O
! O
! O

Why O
does O
this O
little O
compact O
travel O
dryer O
work O
better O
than O
my O
bigger O
more O
expensive O
hair O
dryer O
? O
Which O
I O
've O
put O
away O
in O
the O
guest O
bathroom O
. O
This O
is O
a O
great O
little O
dryer O
. O
I O
wish O
it O
had O
a O
quick O
cool O
shot O
button O
, O
but O
I O
would O
n't O
avoid O
buying O
it O
for O
that O
reason O
. O

works O
really O
well O
. O

I O
've O
only O
used O
this O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
, O
but O
so O
far O
has O
met O
my O
expectations O
. O
  O
Just O
installed O
a O
new O
handicapped O
shower O
, O
mounted O
this O
just O
outside O
the O
shower O
above O
a O
GFI O
receptacle O
. O
  O
it O
does O
a O
great O
job O
both O
drying O
me O
off O
, O
and O
drying O
the O
many O
shelves O
in O
the O
shower O
which O
hold O
water O
. O
My O
soap O
now O
stays O
dry O
and O
firm O
, O
and O
my O
bath O
mat O
does O
n't O
get O
waterlogged O
. O
Best O
feature O
- O
The O
magnet O
which O
holds O
the O
dryer O
in O
the O
cradle O
. O
Most O
plastic O
latches O
fail O
after O
a O
few O
months O
, O
but O
the O
magnet O
should O
be O
bulletproof O
. O
I O
also O
like O
the O
long O
cord O
which O
reaches O
to O
the O
end O
of O
my O
5 O
foot O
shower O
. O
If O
one O
does O
n't O
have O
a O
backer O
board O
I O
recommend O
Molly O
anchors O
to O
mount O
the O
dryer O
metal O
bracket O
. O

Awesome O
product O
but O
did O
not O
give O
5 O
stars O
because O
it O
did O
n't O
last O
long O
before O
it O
started O
giving O
problems O
. O
For O
the O
money O
paid O
, O
expected O
the O
product O
to O
hold O
up O
longer O
. O

Good O

this O
blow O
dryer O
is O
very O
powerful O
and O
does O
the O
job O
. O

Love O

None O

This O
works O
well O
. O
Very O
gentle O
and O
it O
makes O
my O
hair O
smooth O

a O
few O
months O

Dry O

I O
adapted O

  O
The O

So O

like O

The O

The O

Overall O
I O
'm O
pretty O
happy O
with O
my O

very O
disappointed- O
i O
have O

5 O
- O
6 O

the O
last O
2 O
i O
ordered O
from O
amazon O
the O

it O
fits O

and O
sparks- O
which O
is O
scary- O

itself- O
but O
the O
new O

faulty- O
what O
can O
be O
done O

? O

My O
old O

Great O

This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
amazing!only O
flaw O
: O
there O
's O
no O
swivel O
cord O
, O
making O
it O
resist O
moving O
around O
. O
Otherwise O
, O
its O
great O
! O
the O
PERFECT O
size O
for O
my O
weekend O
bag O
and O
there O
are O
plenty O
of O
settings O
. O

I O
love O
this O
dryer O
! O
  O
It O
is O
so O
much O
more O
powerful O
than O
the O
one O
that O
it O
replaced O
. O
  O
It O
does O
n't O
cause O
my O
hair O
to O
frizz O
and O
I O
have O
been O
able O
to O
drastically O
cut O
down O
on O
the O
amount O
of O
flat O
- O
ironing O
I O
do O
. O
  O
It O
is O
somewhat O
heavy O
, O
but O
this O
is O
to O
be O
expected O
with O
the O
extra O
power O
that O
it O
provides O
and O
I O
really O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
weight O
. O
  O
I O
love O
the O
heavy O
- O
duty O
, O
long O
cord O
it O
has O
too O
! O
  O
My O
only O
complaint O
is O
one O
that O
I O
have O
heard O
from O
other O
viewers O
- O
the O
control O
buttons O
are O
somewhat O
awkward O
. O
  O
I O
have O
had O
to O
get O
used O
to O
holding O
this O
dryer O
in O
a O
different O
way O
than O
I O
've O
always O
held O
all O
other O
hairdryers O
. O
  O
If O
I O
hold O
it O
in O
the O
usual O
way O
, O
it O
is O
extremely O
easy O
to O
accidentally O
push O
the O
buttons O
with O
your O
hand O
and O
inadvertently O
change O
the O
settings O
. O
  O
Other O
than O
this O
small O
issue O
, O
which O
I O
am O
already O
getting O
used O
to O
dealing O
with O
, O
I O
think O
this O
is O
probably O
the O
best O
dryer O
that O
I O
have O
ever O
used O
. O

This O
is O
an O
okay O
product O
. O
If O
you O
avidly O
blow O
- O
dry O
your O
hair O
get O
a O
bigger O
one O
. O
But O
for O
the O
occasional O
use O
it O
's O
okay O

this O
is O
perfect O
, O
works O
great O
and O
so O
easy O
travel O
with O
due O
to O
is O
compact O
size O
. O

Before O
I O
ever O
used O
this O
product O
I O
thought O
all O
hair O
dryers O
are O
the O
same O
because O
they O
simply O
just O
blow O
air O
. O
After O
used O
my O
friend O
's O
Panasonic O
Nano O
hair O
dryer O
, O
I O
knew O
I O
was O
wrong O
. O
This O
is O
so O
much O
better O
than O
the O
cheap O
dryer O
I O
bought O
at O
supermarket O
. O
My O
hair O
was O
n't O
at O
all O
frizzy O
with O
this O
new O
hair O
dryer O
. O
I O
'm O
in O
love O
with O
this O
product O

I O
love O
this O
dryer O
and O
wish O
they O
made O
it O
in O
a O
smaller O
travel O
size O
. O
Only O
drawback O
is O
that O
the O
attachment O
bends O
easily O
so O
if O
you O
pack O
it O
make O
sure O
to O
take O
it O
off O
first O
. O
It O
heats O
up O
better O
than O
any O
other O
dryer O
I O
've O
used O
and O
my O
salon O
uses O
these O
exclusively O
. O

The O
only O
reason O
I O
can O
not O
give O
it O
5 O
stars O
is O
because O
it O
will O
not O
stick O
to O
my O
vanity O
which O
is O
made O
out O
of O
wood O
. O
It O
wo O
n’t O
hold O
in O
place O
after O
I O
place O
the O
blow O
dryer O
. O
Does O
stick O
very O
well O
to O
my O
vanity O
in O
the O
bathroom O
( O
glass O
/ O
marble O
) O
. O

Great O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
Does O
n't O
cause O
too O
much O
frizz O
. O
  O
Love O
the O
retractable O
cord O
. O

Great O
for O
drying O
hair O
! O

I O
'm O
not O
completely O
impressed O
with O
the O
cheap O
plastic O
although O
, O
I O
ve O
used O
it O
about O
6 O
times O
and O
it O
's O
still O
in O
good O
condition O
( O
also O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
I O
am O
hispanic O
and O
have O
very O
long O
, O
thick O
and O
curly O
hair O
) O
. O
I O
purchased O
this O
because O
my O
daughter O
has O
one O
and O
after O
using O
it O
, O
I O
fell O
in O
love O
. O
But O
, O
hers O
is O
definitely O
made O
with O
better O
quality O
materials O
, O
you O
can O
tell O
by O
just O
holding O
both O
of O
them O
in O
your O
hands O
the O
difference O
in O
quality O
. O
  O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
getting O
a O
super O
steal O
based O
on O
the O
price O
I O
paid O
for O
it O
( O
$ O
25 O
) O
opposed O
to O
what O
my O
daughter O
paid O
( O
she O
purchased O
hers O
directly O
from O
Andis O
for O
$ O
52 O
) O
As O
I O
previously O
mentioned O
, O
mines O
is O
still O
in O
good O
condition O
after O
using O
it O
several O
times O
, O
I O
'm O
just O
waiting O
to O
see O
how O
many O
more O
uses O
I O
get O
out O
of O
it O
. O
This O
is O
a O
case O
of O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
. O

Very O
fprceful O
and O
dries O
my O
hair O
in O
5 O
minutes O
- O
just O
like O
the O
professionals O
do O
it O
. O

The O
lower O
setting O
does O
not O
work O

I O
bought O
this O
Two O
days O
ago O
as O
my O
old O
dryer O
( O
conair O
1875 O
watt O
) O
has O
n't O
been O
drying O
as O
well O
lately O
. O
  O
I O
was O
impressed O
immediately O
with O
this O
dryer O
. O
  O
It O
is O
beautiful O
. O
  O
It O
is O
slightly O
heavier O
than O
my O
last O
one O
, O
  O
but O
it O
cut O
drying O
time O
considerably O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
this O
will O
be O
an O
issue O
. O
  O
It O
has O
three O
speeds O
. O
  O
It O
has O
three O
temperature O
settings O
. O
The O
highest O
is O
hotter O
than O
any O
blow O
dryer O
i O
have O
ever O
used O
. O
  O
I O
just O
dried O
my O
hair O
with O
it O
and O
my O
naturally O
wavy O
hair O
is O
so O
straight O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
break O
out O
my O
flat O
iron O
. O
Yes O
, O
I O
am O
amazed O
by O
this O
thing O
! O
The O
medium O
heat O
setting O
is O
equivalent O
to O
my O
last O
dryers O
hottest O
setting O
. O
  O
I O
have O
twin O
daughters O
that O
are O
young O
and O
I O
think O
the O
only O
setting O
cool O
enough O
to O
dry O
their O
hair O
with O
is O
the O
lowest O
heat O
Setting O
. O
This O
dryer O
is O
so O
powerful O
, O
  O
yet O
a O
ton O
quieter O
than O
my O
previous O
dryer O
. O
My O
husband O
even O
commented O
on O
how O
quiet O
it O
is O
. O
My O
husband O
also O
liked O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
is O
heavier O
. O
  O
Being O
a O
mechanic O
he O
said O
it O
probably O
has O
a O
stronger O
, O
  O
more O
durable O
motor O
. O
I O
was O
reading O
the O
booklet O
that O
was O
included O
, O
and O
this O
dryer O
has O
a O
four O
year O
warranty O
. O
  O
That O
's O
pretty O
astounding O
considering O
the O
price O
point O
. O
  O
I O
love O
this O
dryer O
, O
  O
and O
I O
'd O
buy O
it O
again O
in O
a O
heart O
beat O
. O
  O
I O
'm O
thinking O
about O
buying O
another O
one O
to O
store O
, O
  O
because O
I O
seriously O
love O
it O
that O
much O
! O
  O
Go O
buy O
it O
! O

The O
description O
for O
this O
product O
is O
incorrect O
. O
  O
It O
does O
not O
contain O
a O
cool O
shot O
button O

Used O
once O
on O
vacation O
so O
I O
can O
not O
comment O
on O
the O
longevity O
of O
this O
product O
. O
Size O
is O
slightly O
bigger O
than O
I O
had O
hoped O
, O
but O
I O
bought O
it O
because O
it O
was O
the O
best O
looking O
diffuser O
to O
come O
w. O
a O
travel O
dryer O
that O
I O
could O
find O
. O
  O
Price O
was O
right O
and O
I O
think O
it O
was O
a O
good O
investment O
for O
a O
travel O
dryer O
only- O
I O
would O
not O
use O
this O
for O
regular O
at O
home O
use O
. O

The O
wife O
is O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
. O
  O
It O
was O
a O
replacement O
of O
a O
similar O
Conair O
that O
lasted O
many O
years O
. O
  O
This O
one O
has O
held O
up O
for O
a O
few O
months O
now O
and O
looks O
like O
it O
will O
hold O
up O
like O
the O
old O
one O
. O
  O
I O
am O
pretty O
sure O
she O
will O
buy O
a O
similar O

I O
have O
straight O

my O

leave O
it O
frizzy O
until O
I O
slept O

However O
when O
I O

with O
this O

even O
at O
the O
fast O

, O
it O
was O
smooth O

Now O
that O
I O
have O
a O
digital O
perm O

I O
can O
use O
the O

I O
put O
half O
of O
my O
hair O
twisted O
, O
sectioned O
into O
thirds O
and O
put O
it O
on O
the O

It O
works O
wonderful O

I O
have O
a O
Conair O
hair O
dryer O
that O
I O
use O
at O
home O
. O
  O
I O
bought O
this O
one O
for O
a O
trip O
to O
the O
UK O
because O
of O
the O
dual O
voltage O

and O
compact O
size O
. O
  O
My O
trip O
is O
in O
three O
weeks O
so O
I O
am O
yet O
to O
try O
it O
out O
overseas O
yet O
but O
it O
arrived O
quickly O
and O
does O
seem O
very O
lightweight O
and O
easy O
to O
pack O
. O

Favorite O
model O
. O
No O
longer O
available O
in O
stores O
. O
Bought O
as O
backup O
for O
3 O
year O
old O
one O
currently O
using O
. O

Works O
great O
- O
multiple O
speed O
and O
temps O
. O

In O
a O
good O
, O
no O
, O
a O
great O
way O
! O
It O
is O
a O
* O
little O
* O
heavier O
than O
some O
models O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
only O
using O
it O
for O
a O
max O
of O
15 O
minutes O
a O
day O
so O
that O
does O
n't O
bother O
me O
. O
And O
I O
only O
mention O
it O
here O
because O
many O
of O
the O
reviewers O
I O
read O
listed O
that O
as O
a O
con O
. O
As O
for O
how O
quiet O
it O
is O
, O
I O
would O
say O
it O
's O
as O
quiet O
as O
the O
other O
quiet O
dryers O
I O
've O
owned O
made O
by O
other O
companies O
. O
It O
's O
not O
a O
whisper O
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O
a O
scream O
. O
My O
hair O
looks O
better O
than O
it O
has O
in O
a O
long O
time O
... O
It O
's O
certainly O
shinier O
and O
looks O
thicker O
when O
I O
use O
this O
dryer O
. O
The O
dryer O
is O
also O
a O
very O
sexy O
looking O
piece O
, O
so O
if O
you O
're O
going O
buy O
based O
on O
looks O
, O
go O
for O
this O
machine O
! O
The O
only O
negative O
I O
have O
is O
the O
cold O
shot O
button O
. O
I O
foresee O
this O
button O
breaking O
easily O
and O
in O
the O
near O
future O
. O
I O
try O
to O
avoid O
using O
the O
shot O
button O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
cold O
setting O
switch O
to O
prolong O
the O
inevitable O
, O
though O
. O
  O
I O
truly O
do O
love O
this O
dryer O

I O
was O
not O
compensated O
for O
my O
review O

I O
bought O
the O
dryer O
after O
researching O
. O
I O
'm O
very O
happy O
with O
my O
purchase O
! O

Powerful O
, O
and O
quiet O
. O
It O
does O
n't O
have O
that O
high O
pitched O
whine O
. O
It O
does O
n't O
get O
super O
hot O
and O
does O
n't O
have O
to O
because O
it O
's O
powerful O
enough O
. O
Other O
dryers O
would O
make O
my O
hair O
hot O
to O
the O
touch O
or O
burn O
my O
hand O
. O
My O
hair O
seems O
to O
be O
healthier O

smoother O

own O
a O
Turbo O
Power O
but O
should O
have O
been O
buying O
for O
years O
. O
Live O
and O
learn!I O
have O
very O
fine O
, O
thin O
, O
hair O
and O
all O
my O
other O
dryers O
have O
been O
to O
harsh O
on O
my O
fragile O
locks O
with O
1875 O
watts O
. O
After O
researching O
the O
best O
for O
my O
hair O
issues O
- O
the O
lower O
wattage O
, O
1500 O
, O
  O
is O
perfect O
and O
dries O
my O
hair O
beautifully O
, O
smooth O
and O
shinny O
. O
This O
dryer O
is O
also O
very O
substantial O
in O
motor O
which O
is O
important O
to O
me O
so O
it O
will O
last O
. O

Very O
lightweight O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
end O
up O
with O
cramped O
arms O
after O
using O
these O
. O
The O
buttons O
are O
also O
placed O
away O
from O
my O
fingers O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
accidentally O
turn O
them O
off O
. O

Bargain O

. O

Only O
had O
my O

the O

. O
  O
Ionic O

Tucked O
out O
of O
the O
way O
in O
the O
female O
's O
bathroom O
of O
my O
home O
. O
I O
also O
purchased O
one O
for O
the O
male O
's O

in O
the O
house O
and O
will O
put O
in O
the O
master O
bathroom O
once O
I O
am O
complete O
with O
the O
remodel O
so O
if O
I O
ever O
get O
married O
again O
she O
will O
have O
one O
to O
use O
. O
great O
night O
light O
also O
. O
never O
have O
to O
turn O
on O
the O
bathroom O
light O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night O
.. O

It O
is O
the O
best O
hair O
dryer O
I O
have O
! O
I O
used O
have O
a O
old O
one O
which O
I O
used O
for O
many O
years O
! O
Best O
quality O
! O

Fairly O
quiet O
as O
hair O
dryers O
go O
. O
Like O
the O
attachments O
. O
LOVE O
the O
brown O
and O
pink O
color O

Excellent O
product O
. O
  O
This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
hair O
dryer O
i O
have O
ever O
own O
. O
  O
Highly O
recommended O
:-) O

Decided O
to O
buy O
this O
hairdryer O
based O
on O
all O
the O
positive O
reviews O
. O
  O
I O
am O
very O
pleased O
with O
my O
purchase O
. O
The O
reviews O
are O
accurate O
and O
the O
price O
is O
great O
too O
. O

Overall O
I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
product O
. O
  O
My O
old O
blowdryer O
was O
awkward O
to O
work O
with O
and O
weak O
, O
and O
I O
would O
only O
blow O
dry O
my O
hair O
for O
special O
occasions O
. O
  O
Now O
I O
blow O
dry O
my O
hair O
every O
time O
it O
's O
washed O
. O
  O
My O
blow O
- O
dry O
time O
has O
been O
cut O
in O
half O
with O
this O
blow O
dryer O
. O
  O
It O
's O
much O
more O
powerful O
than O
similarly O
priced O
blow O
dryers O
. O
  O
It O
has O
a O
long O
, O
sturdy O
power O
cord O
, O
which O
makes O
the O
dryer O
easier O
to O
maneuver O
around O
to O
dry O
and O
style O
your O
hair O
. O
  O
It O
comes O
with O
a O
nozzle O
but O
not O
a O
diffuser O
, O
so O
if O
you O
use O
a O
diffuser O
you O
'll O
need O
to O
purchase O
one O
separately O
. O

Fantastic O
hair O
dryer O
! O
Was O
searching O
for O
a O
new O
hair O
dryer O
as O
my O
hot O
tools O
dryer O
was O
giving O
off O
a O
burning O
smell O
and O
really O
drying O
out O
my O
hair O
. O
I O
decided O
on O
xtava O
because O
of O
the O
good O
reviews O
and O
so O
glad O
I O
purchased O
it O
. O
  O
The O
nozzle O
for O
the O
dryer O
stays O
firmly O
in O
place O
which O
is O
fantastic O
since O
when O
I O
tried O
to O
use O
one O
on O
my O
previous O
dryers O
, O
it O
would O
always O
fall O
off O
. O
  O
My O
hair O
comes O
out O
super O
smooth O
. O
  O
It O
is O
very O
powerful O
and O
not O
super O
noisy O
. O
Another O
great O
feature O
is O
the O
removable O
back O
to O
clean O
out O
lint O
! O
I O
was O
also O
really O
impressed O
with O
the O
welcome O
letter O
from O
the O
company O
I O
received O
via O
email O
after O
I O
received O
the O
dryers O
with O
tips O
on O
blow O
drying O
my O
hair O
. O
Would O
definitely O
recommend O
this O
dryer O
to O
anyone O
I O
know O
. O

Love O
it O
! O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
much O
about O
ionic O
dryers O
because O
I O
previously O
had O
the O
same O
hair O
dryer O
for O
over O
15 O
years O
. O
I O
like O
this O
one O
so O
far O
. O
It O
is O
sturdy O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
consider O
it O
heavy O
. O
It O
has O
enough O
heat O
settings O
in O
my O
opinion O
and O
also O
includes O
a O
cool O
setting O
, O
similar O
to O
a O
hooded O
dryer O
, O
which O
I O
like O
, O
my O
last O
dryer O
did O
not O
have O
this O
. O

this O
is O
my O
2nd O
purchase O
of O
this O
product O
I O
wore O
the O
first O
one O
out O
after O
11 O
years O
! O
it O
still O
worked O
but O
the O
black O
cover O
blocking O
the O
heat O
would O
no O
longer O
stay O
on O
. O
I O
love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
it O
leaves O
my O
hair O
so O
soft O
no O
frizz O
! O
Well O
worth O
the O
money O
.. O
one O
of O
those O
cases O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
! O

Bonnet O
is O
so O
rediculously O
small O
it O
could O
not O
be O
placed O
on O
head O
of O
adult O
, O
let O
alone O
dry O
hair O
on O
rollers O
. O
I O
ca O
n't O
imagine O
what O
the O
professional O
is O
, O
certainly O
not O
a O
hair O
salon O
with O
this O
quality O
! O
  O
Disappointing O
. O
  O
Time O
consuming O
. O
Received O
when O
I O
got O
home O
5/7 O
. O
Diirected O
by O
Amazon O
to O
be O
returned O
by O
5/7 O
! O
  O
Silly O
waste O
. O

Very O
pleased O
with O
the O
dryer O
. O
  O
It O
's O
a O
little O
heavier O
than O
my O
last O
one O
, O
but O
does O
a O
great O
job O
. O
I O
would O
recommend O
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
blow O
dryer O
. O
Even O
my O
mother O
- O
in O
- O
law O
said O
it O
is O
awesome O
. O
It O
is O
powerful O
and O
dries O
my O
hair O
fast O
. O
I O
plan O
to O
look O
at O
other O
products O
made O
by O
them O
as O
well O
. O

Sweet O
, O
works O
as O
expected O
! O

I O
love O
it O
, O
it O
fits O
my O
little O
peanut O
head O
just O
fine O
and O
really O
snug O
. O
I O
used O
it O
to O
deep O
condition O
my O
hair O
with O
a O
plastic O
cap O
and O
silk O
bonnet O
on O
top O
then O
the O
hair O
dryer O
bonnet O
. O
I O
used O
the O
silk O
bonnet O
to O
protect O
my O
ears O
and O
neck O
from O
getting O
to O
hot O
. O
This O
is O
the O
first O
time O
I O
have O
ordered O
this O
and O
I O
'm O
very O
happy O
. O

Highly O
satisfied O
with O
the O
hair O
dryer O
and O
the O

. O
My O
hair O
is O
long O
and O
thick O
. O
It O
is O
every O
texture O
in O
the O

. O
Some O
curly O
hair O
, O
some O
straight O
, O
some O
frizzy O
, O
some O
fine O
, O
a O
lot O
gray O
, O
all O
highlighted O
/ O
colored O
. O
It O
normally O
takes O
me O
20 O
- O
30 O
minutes O
to O
get O
it O
completely O
dry O
. O
Then O
I O
need O
to O
use O
the O
flat O
iron O
to O
calm O
it O
all O
down O
. O
With O
this O
hair O
dryer O
I O
had O
it O
completely O
dry O
in O
10 O
minutes O
. O
When O
I O
use O
it O
with O
the O
Goody O
Quikstyle O
brush O
my O
hair O
is O
smooth O
enough O
that O
I O
only O
have O
to O
touch O
up O
a O
couple O
places O
with O
the O
flat O
iron O
. O
I O
live O

tell O
you O
how O
happy O

used O
. O
  O
Large O
impellers O
really O
put O
out O
some O
air O
which O
speeds O
drying O
. O
  O
Can O
be O
very O
powerful O
or O
not O
depending O
on O
the O
setting O
you O
choose O
. O

excellent O
I O
love O
it O

Perfect O
hairdryer O
. O

Wonderful O
! O
Just O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
. O
I O
have O
medium O
length O
, O
thick O
, O
wavy O
hair O
. O
It O
smooths O
as O
it O
dries O
. O
Is O
light O
weight O
and O
quiet O
. O
And O
I O
love O
how O
hot O
it O
gets- O
lets O
me O
know O
its O
really O
working O
! O

excellent O

My O
hair O
normally O
takes O
forever O
to O
dry O
, O
but O
not O
with O
this O
dryer O
. O
It O
  O
drys O
so O
quickly O
and O
will O
NOT O
dry O
out O
your O
hair O
. O
Worth O
every O
penny O

I O
like O
it O
but O
the O
only O
problem O
is O
everytime O
I O
dry O
my O
hair O
, O
the O
front O
cover O
always O
falling O
out O
:( O

It O
works O
ok O
but O
it O
's O
not O
the O
easiest O
drier O
to O
use O
. O
It O
has O
an O
odor O
to O
it O
and O
I O
wish O
it O
was O
just O
a O
little O
smaller O
in O
size O

Very O
good O

This O
is O
a O
very O
nice O
dryer O
. O

Suits O
my O
needs O
very O
well O
. O
Quiet O
and O
compact O
. O

The O
dryer O
seems O
to O
be O
of O
good O
quality O
and O
would O
be O
easy O
to O
use O
if O
the O
nozzle O
were O
shorter O
. O
  O
I O
like O
the O
hairdryer O
itself O
very O
much O
but O
the O
nozzle O
is O
so O
long O
that O
I O
ca O
n't O
style O
the O
back O
of O
my O
hair O
easily O
. O
  O
I O
have O
shorter O
arms O
but O
I O
have O
never O
had O
this O
problem O
with O
other O
hair O
dryers O
. O
  O
Do O
you O
have O
a O
shorter O
nozzle O
to O
fit O
this O
dryer O
? O
  O
I O
bought O
this O
dryer O
because O
my O
old O
one O
was O
wearing O
out O
and O
a O
piece O
of O
the O
nozzle O
came O
off O
- O
making O
it O
difficult O
to O
use O
. O

I O
tend O
to O
have O
frizzy O
hair O
. O
  O
I O
honestly O
have O
n't O
noticed O
a O
difference O
between O
this O
hair O
dryer O
or O
any O
old O
regular O
hair O
dryer O
making O
my O
hair O
less O
frizzy O
. O
  O
I O
ordered O
this O
one O
because O
my O
old O
one O
broke O
. O
  O
I O
'm O
not O
noticing O
any O
difference O
. O

This O
dryer O
works O
well O
for O
a O
time O
, O
but O
breaks O
easily O
. O
I O
've O
replaced O
it O
3 O
times O
! O
THREE O
! O
I O
bought O
it O
because O
it O
was O
the O
cheapest O
option O
, O
but O
after O
purchasing O
it O
3 O
times O
, O
I O
should O
've O
just O
gone O
with O
a O
higher O
end O
model O
. O

Stopped O
working O
after O
3 O
months O
. O

Not O
recommended O
. O
  O
It O
does O
n't O
get O
hot O
and O
the O
comb O
was O
flimsy O
. O
Very O
disappointed O

Perfect O
size O
for O
traveling O
abroad O
and O
the O
price O
was O
right O
! O
I O
wish O
it O
was O
a O
tad O
more O
powerful O
but O
I O
can O
live O
with O
it O
as O
is O
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
good O
dryer O
, O
I O
give O
it O
5 O
stars O
. O
Thanks O

Very O
small O
and O
very O
light O
. O
  O
Perfect O
for O
travel O
and O
my O
silicon O
diffuser O
fits O
right O
over O
the O
nozzles O
. O
  O
I O
recommend O
this O
product O
. O

fit O
right O
where O
we O
needed O
it O
in O
our O
motorhome O

Heavy O
Duty O
awesome O
dryer O
. O
The O
cord O
alone O
lends O
itself O
to O
the O
words O
heavy O
duty O
. O
Powerful O
, O
light O
weight O
, O
multi O

. O
The O
best O
dryer O
I O
've O
ever O
purchased O
in O
my O
50 O
+ O
years O
, O
that O
is O
when O
hand O
held O
dryers O
began O
. O
I O
have O
long O
hair O
and O
it O
's O
cut O
my O
time O
in O
half O
. O
I O
ca O
n't O
say O
more O
other O
than O
I O
hope O
it O
last O
me O
a O
long O
time O
. O

Thought O
it O
would O
be O
more O
powerful O
, O
is O
it O
really O
2000 O
watts O
? O

Extremely O
fast O
delivery O
and O
the O
product O
works O
great O
. O
Very O
happy O
! O

it O
's O
great O
i O
enjoy O
working O
it O
. O
thanks O
much O
  O

as O
expected O
! O
good O

I O
would O
give O
it O
zero O
stars O
if O
I O
could O
but O
unfortunately O
that O
is O
not O
an O
option O
. O
I O
bought O
this O
product O
because O
it O
was O
dual O
voltage O
, O
and O
it O
not O
only O
burnt O
in O
the O
first O
time O
I O
used O
it O
, O
it O
also O
caught O
fire O
. O
I O
strongly O
do O
not O
recommend O
anyone O
to O
buy O
this O
product O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
on O
the O
recommendation O
of O
my O
stylist O
and O
I O
hate O
it O
. O
  O
The O
hot O
setting O
is O
too O
hot O
and O
burns O
my O
scalp O
, O
the O
power O
is O
too O
strong O
and O
makes O
my O
hair O
completely O
flat O
and O
yet O
, O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
dry O
it O
unless O
it O
's O
on O
these O
higher O
settings O
. O
  O
Also O
, O
it O
is O
a O
very O
heavy O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
I O
am O
very O
disappointed O
in O
this O
product O
. O
  O
Wish O
I O
had O
kept O
the O
box O
to O
return O
. O
  O
This O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
splurge O
. O

Dries O
my O
hair O
incredibly O
quickly O
. O
What O
used O
to O
take O
20 O
minutes O
now O
takes O
5 O
, O
it O
makes O
getting O
ready O
in O
the O
morning O
much O
more O
pleasant O
. O

I O
like O
how O
it O
has O
a O
low O
, O
medium O
, O
and O
high O
setting O
. O
  O
( O
Have O
nt O
bought O
a O
new O
dryer O
in O
a O
while O
:) O
  O
i O
just O
wish O
the O
concentrator O
was O
a O
bit O
thinner O
since O
that O
would O
cause O
less O
frizz O
. O

I O
have O
long O
thick O
hair O
and O
I O
go O
through O
blow O
dryers O
like O
crazy O
. O
This O
blow O
dryer O
dries O
my O
hair O
quickly O
. O
It O
's O
not O
too O
heavy O
and O
is O
easy O
to O
hold O
. O
Love O
it O
! O

I O
recently O
became O
aware O
of O
Xtava O
products O
while O
looking O
for O
a O
new O
hairdryer O
. O
I O
wanted O
the O
ceramic O
ionic O
technology O
as O
I O
have O
baby O
fine O
hair O
which O
tends O
to O
break O
and O
attract O
static O
way O
too O
easily O
. O
This O
hair O
dryer O
has O
been O
amazing O
. O
It O
's O
super O
quiet O
and O
has O
multiple O
heat O
levels O
which O
is O
great O
. O
I O
can O
usually O
dry O
my O
hair O
in O
about O
4 O
to O
5 O
minutes O
. O
I O
use O
the O
dryer O
with O
a O
flat O
brush O
, O
and O
have O
noticed O
my O
hair O
is O
smooth O
, O
shiny O
, O
and O
frizz O
free O
. O
I O
also O
have O
to O
say O
that O
Xtava O
has O
excellent O
customer O
service O
. O
When O
I O
originally O
purchased O
the O
dryer O
, O
Amazon O
fulfilled O
the O
order O
and O
shipped O
the O
wrong O
one O
. O
Xtava O
was O
super O
helpful O
in O
getting O
the O
issue O
resolved O
with O
Amazon O
. O
I O
now O
own O
two O
Xtava O
dryers O
and O
love O
them O
both O
. O
I O
'm O
really O
happy O
with O
my O
purchases O
, O
and O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
Xtava O
products O
. O
I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
dryer O
. O

I O
have O
had O
three O
of O
these O
over O
the O
years O
. O
Ionizing O
dryer O
keeps O
the O
frizz O
out O
of O
your O
hair O
. O
Cool O
setting O
is O
nice O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
two O
settings O
for O
hot O
, O
blasting O
and O
normal O
. O
Great O
hair O
dryer O
! O

The O
hair O
dryer O
has O
performed O
very O
, O
very O
well O
. O
I O
had O
n't O
realized O
how O
much O
time O
the O
old O
dryer O
was O
taking O
to O
dry O
and O
style O
my O
hair O
. O
Claire O

Great O

Simply O

work O
! O

Love O
it O
dry O
so O
fast O
, O
not O
very O
good O
with O
freez O
but O
for O
the O
price O
is O
good O
. O

The O
Heat O
guard O
attachment O
constantly O
pops O
off O
& O
there O
's O
nothing O
you O
can O
do O
about O
it O
. O
Do O
n't O
waste O
your O
money O

It O
's O
really O
bad O
! O
! O
It O
stopped O
working O
from O
the O
1st O
use O
 O

Great O

Love O
the O
small O
size O
and O
the O
way O
that O
it O
dries O
my O
hair O

  O
Great O
little O
hair O
dryer O
. O

This O
is O
the O
4th O
time O
I O
've O
bought O
this O
dryer O
over O
the O
course O
of O
a O
several O
years O
. O
It O
does O
fail O
at O
some O
point O
, O
but O
at O
the O
constant O
daily O
use O
it O
gets O
. O
Still O
very O
worth O
the O
price O
, O
it O
's O
quite O
powerful O
and O
puts O
out O
more O
heat O
and O
airflow O
than O
others O
I O
've O
used O
. O
Very O
happy O
with O
it O
overall O
! O

over O
priced O
junk O

Excellent O
noise O
levels O
-- O
very O
low O
. O
Heat O
control O
very O
good O
as O
well O
. O
Great O
hairdryer O
so O
far O
, O
particularly O
vs. O
previous O
Conair O
models O
. O

The O
retractable O
cord O
is O
wonderful O
for O
storage O
. O
  O
Power O
is O
great O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
hair O
dryer O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
ago O
after O
my O
old O
Conair O
died O
. O
  O
I O
like O
to O
use O
my O
dryers O
on O
low O
speed O
, O
but O
high O
heat O
. O
  O
Although O
the O
two O
settings O
should O
be O
independent O
, O
this O
dryer O
is O
just O
lukewarm O
on O
low O
speed O
. O
  O
It O
also O
made O
my O
hair O
fuzzy O
, O
and O
while O
it O
was O
lightweight O
- O
it O
felt O
cheap O
. O
I O
quit O
using O
it O
two O
months O
after O
I O
started O
using O
it O
and O
invested O
in O
a O
better O
dryer O
. O
  O
I O
purchased O
the O
Elchim O
2001 O
through O
Amazon O
, O
and O
while O
it O
's O
a O
bit O
more O
expensive O
( O
$ O
80 O
) O
, O
it O
's O
worth O
every O
penny O
. O
  O
I O
would O
not O
recommend O
the O
Conair O
1875 O
, O
unless O
you O
want O
your O
hair O
to O
look O
like O
a O
fuzzy O
mess O
. O

Great O
performance O
but O
they O
need O
work O
on O
the O
product O
painting O
, O
the O
paint O
started O
pilling O
after O
a O
few O
day O
's O
using O
the O
dryer O
but O
in O
general O
it O
's O
a O
great O
product O
for O
the O
price O

great O
product O
for O
price O

The O
dryer O
work O
fine O
for O
about O
10 O
months O
but O
it O
did O
end O
up O
catching O
fire O
while O
I O
was O
using O
it O
. O
I O
think O
for O
the O
price O
it O
should O
last O
longer O
than O
10 O
  O
months O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
little O
dryer O
. O
I O
bought O
it O
after O
using O
one O
in O
a O
hotel O
and O
wanting O
one O
for O
myself O
. O
It O
is O
very O
basic O
but O
does O
the O
job O
without O
destroying O
my O
eardrums O
. O
A O
minor O
complaint O
is O
that O
the O
cord O
is O
bit O
on O
the O
short O
side O
, O
but O
I O
cope O
with O
it O
. O

Great O
little O
dryer O

The O
motor O
died O
after O
a O
year O
of O
very O
light O
use O
. O
( O
2 O
- O
3x O
/ O

) O
. O
It O
was O
a O
very O
poor O
value O
for O
the O
$ O
80 O
I O
paid O
in O
Sept O

very O

were O
not O
as O
good O
as O
I O
get O
with O
my O
drugstore O
cheapie O
; O
hairs O
would O
get O
chomped O
and O
tangled O
in O
the O
dryer O
; O
poor O
button O
placement O
so O
the O
controls O
were O
frequently O
switched O
on O
/ O
off O
, O
high O
/ O
low O
by O
the O
palm O
of O
my O
hand O
while O
I O
was O
trying O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
. O
( O
Maybe O
I O
gripped O
it O
funny O
, O
but O
it O
did O
annoy O
me O
every O
time O
I O
used O
it O
) O

makes O
my O
hair O
smooth O

Wow O
, O
this O
dryer O
came O
in O
and O
I O
was O
so O
happy O
with O
the O
design O
and O
color O
of O
it O
. O
It O
also O
came O
in O
the O
nick O
of O
time O
as O
my O
much O
cheaper O
hair O
dryer O
had O
just O
went O
out O
. O
Believe O
me O
when O
I O
say O
this O
hair O
dryer O
is O
top O
of O
the O
line O
! O
Straight O
out O
of O
the O
box O
I O
noticed O
that O
it O
was O
light O
weight O
and O
had O
a O
sleek O
design O
. O
Upon O
use O
of O
this O
product O
I O
seen O
that O
it O
had O
several O
different O
settings O
as O
to O
get O
the O
desired O
drying O
time O
you O
'd O
like O
. O
It O
includes O
a O
diffuser O
to O
keep O
your O
hair O
from O
getting O
too O
overheated O
and O
dried O
out O
plus O
it O
has O
a O
reset O
and O
test O
button O
on O
the O
plug O
in O
. O
When O
I O
used O
this O
hair O
dryer O
I O
noticed O
that O
at O
the O
highest O
heat O
that O
the O
air O
is O
not O
super O
strong O
like O
some O
other O
hair O
dryers O
out O
there O
, O
but O
it O
definitely O
dries O
your O
hair O
in O
record O
time O
! O
This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
easy O
to O
hold O
on O
to O
whilst O
drying O
your O
hair O
and O
has O
a O
good O
vent O
on O
the O
back O
as O
to O
not O
clog O
up O
easily O
. O
I O
recommend O
this O
hair O
dryer O
to O
anyone O
looking O
for O
a O
new O
replacement O
because O
it O
work O
really O
well O
and O

high O
quality O
for O
your O
money O
. O
I O
got O
this O
product O
for O
purpose O
of O
review O
, O
all O
claims O
and O
views O
are O
100 O
percent O
my O
own O
. O

Was O
advertised O
as O
red O
and O
came O
as O
salmon O
pink O
. O
Lasted O
roughly O
2 O
years O
before O
the O
heating O
element O
went O
out O
. O
Also O
, O
fairly O
weak O
fan O
. O

Used O
to O
a O
little O
more O
power O
but O
from O
a O
small O
( O
hotel O
- O
like O
) O
dryer O
, O
it O
works O
well O
. O

I O
am O
so O
excited O
by O
this O
dryer O
. O
It O
much O
quieter O
than O
my O
old O
one O
and O
dries O
my O
hair O
super O
fast O
without O
feeling O
dried O
out O
. O

Horrible O
, O
lasted O
6 O
weeks O
than O
started O
sparking O
flames!Would O
NOT O
recommend O

Not O
disappointed O
. O
Works O
well O
and O
super O
small O
, O
perfect O
for O
travel O
. O

OK O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
I O
like O
the O
non O
- O
skid O
rubber O
thingies O
on O
the O
sides O
of O
the O
dryer O
so O
it O
does O
n't O
slip O
off O
bathroom O
shelf O
. O
  O
The O
overall O
drying O
could O
be O
improved O
. O
  O
My O
Vidal O
Sassoon O
travel O
dryer O
of O
the O
same O
wattage O
dried O
my O
hair O
much O
faster O
. O
  O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
buy O
another O
one O
of O
those O
again O
and O
just O
keep O
this O
one O
as O
a O
backup O
dryer O
in O
our O
guest O
bath O
. O

Powerful O
as O
any O
other O
hairdryer O
out O
there O
. O
Compact O
and O
ligthweight O
enough O
for O
my O
overseas O
travel O
. O
  O
And O
so O
convenient O
to O
not O
have O
to O
carry O
a O
converter O
. O
  O
I O
absolutely O
recommend O
at O
this O
price O
. O

Had O
one O
of O
these O
in O
dark O
blue O
for O
years O
, O
it O
finally O
gave O
out O
. O
This O
one O
is O
alright O
, O
but O
feels O
lighted O
and O
cheaper O
made O
then O
my O
old O
one O
. O
Love O
the O
retractable O
cord O
. O

Dryer O
is O
extremely O
heavy O
! O
  O
Not O
as O
hot O
or O
strong O
as O
other O
comparably O
priced O
dryers O
. O
  O
Buttons O
are O
easy O
to O
accidentally O
press O
while O
drying O
. O
  O
Returned O
it O
after O
trying O
it O
once O

BEST O
BLOWDRYER O
for O
NATURAL O
GIRLS O
. O
I O
Never O
use O
anything O
else O

A O
little O
heavy O
for O
a O
travel O
dryer O

very O
fast O
drying O
experience O
! O

I O
absolutely O
love O
that O
it O
offers O
the O
two O
heat O
settings O
and O
separate O
speeds O
. O
My O
old O
dryer O
only O
had O
one O
control O
and O
if O
you O
wanted O
high O
speed O
it O
meant O
you O
had O
to O
have O
hair O
frying O
temperatures O
along O
with O
it O
. O
With O
the O
Wind O
Flower O
dryer O
I O
'm O
able O
to O
have O
a O
cooler O
temperature O
and O
impressively O
fast O
blowing O
capabilities O
. O
I O
have O
thick O
hard O
to O
dry O
hair O
and O
I O
can O
honestly O
say O
that O
I O
dried O
my O
hair O
faster O
than O
I O
ever O
have O
with O
other O
dryers O
. O
It O
's O
light O
weight O
so O
my O
arm O
did O
n't O
get O
tired O
using O
it O
which O
is O
also O
great O
. O
I O
received O
this O
with O
a O
promotional O
discount O
however O
my O
reviews O
are O
honest O
and O
unbiased O
. O

Pleased O
with O
packaging O
and O
shipping O
. O
Pleased O
with O
product O
. O
Its O
better O
than O
our O
other O
brands O
and O
love O
how O
fast O
it O
dries O
my O
hair O
and O
leaves O
it O
less O
frizzy O
. O

This O
hair O
dryer O
performs O
as O
expected O
. O
  O
I O
have O
dry O
/ O
damaged O
hair O
due O
to O
chemo O
2 O
years O
ago O
. O
  O
I O
have O
never O
owned O
a O
hair O
dryer O
and O
thought O
that O
maybe O
blow O
drying O
my O
hair O
with O
a O
diffuser O
to O
increase O
wave O
/ O
curl O
would O
make O
it O
look O
better O
but O
it O
did O
n't O
. O
  O
However O
this O
is O
not O
due O
to O
the O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
The O
hair O
dryer O
is O
light O
, O
was O
very O
easy O
to O
operate O
and O
try O
different O
hair O
styles O
with O
especially O
since O
it O
includes O
both O
a O
diffuser O
and O
a O
concentrator O
. O
I O
tried O
at O
least O
10 O
different O
hair O
styles O
with O
this O
thing O
and O
found O
it O
super O
easy O
to O
adjust O
and O
operate O
. O
  O
Feature O
I O
love O
the O
most O
: O
adjustable O
heat O
setting O
. O
  O
I O
use O
the O
warm O
instead O
of O
hot O
and O
I O
can O
put O
the O
fan O
on O
low O
or O
high O
depending O
on O
how O
fast O
I O
want O
it O
. O
  O
Great O
dryer O
for O
the O
price O
but O
also O
for O
all O
of O
the O
features O
. O

I O
've O
used O
this O
dryer O
for O
over O
a O
year O
now O
and O
I O
think O
it O
works O
really O
well O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
find O
any O
difference O
between O
this O
dryer O
and O
normal O
dryer O
but O
it O
blow O
dries O
  O
my O
hair O
really O
quickly O
and O
has O
options O
for O
cold O
and O
hot O
air O
. O

Noisy O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
see O
anything O
professional O
about O
this O
dryer O
. O

This O
is O
one O
powerful O
hair O
dryer O
. O
The O
heat O
can O
be O
controlled O
along O
with O
the O
height O
and O
hood O
position O
. O

Great O

THIS O
ISTHE O
BEST O
  O
DRYER O
I O
HAVE O
EVER O
USED O

I O
was O
skeptical O
to O
think O
that O
an O
expensive O
hair O
dryer O
could O
be O
better O
than O
my O
basic O
, O
cheapie O
Conair O
I O
had O
been O
using O
, O
but O
it O
totally O
works O
! O
  O
It O
's O
alot O
heavier O
than O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
but O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
hold O
it O
as O
long O
because O
my O
hair O
actually O
dried O
faster O
. O
  O
I O
got O
lured O
in O
by O
the O
coupon O
but O
it O
was O
still O
alot O
to O
spend O
. O
  O
My O
hair O
was O
healthier O
, O
indeed O
shinier O
and O
less O
frizzy O
after O
blow O
- O
drying O
. O
  O
I O
was O
n't O
exactly O
sure O
how O
to O
use O
all O
the O
nozzle O
attachments O
and O
when O
to O
use O
which O
for O
what O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
still O
experimenting O
. O

Love O
this O
dryer O
the O
best O
that O
I O
have O
found O
so O
far O
. O

Pro O
: O
  O
lightweight O
, O
good O
power O
, O
less O
frizziesCon O
: O
  O
have O
to O
unplug O
nightlight O
in O
bathroom O
to O
accommodate O
the O
large O
GFC O
plug O
of O
dryer O

Works O
great O
! O
! O
Dries O
my O
hair O
quickly O
and O
stores O
beautifully O
with O
the O
retractable O
cord O
and O
folding O
handle O
! O
! O
So O
glad O
I O
got O
it O
; O
) O

It O
is O
heavier O
than O
expected O
and O
does O
n't O
feel O
balanced O
in O
my O
hand O
. O
  O
The O
opening O
and O
attachments O
are O
smaller O
than O
our O
previous O
Remington O
, O
which O
is O
what O
I O
was O
trying O
to O
replace O
. O
  O
It O
is O
okay O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
I O
would O
buy O
the O
same O
model O
again O
. O

Good O

I O
was O
iffy O
after O
I O
ordered O
this O
product O
with O
all O
the O
horrible O
things O
that O
were O
said O
about O
it O
, O
but O
I O
really O
like O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
I O
only O
use O
the O
cold O
settings O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
in O
general O
. O
  O
I O
am O
already O
using O
it O
for O
a O
few O
months O
and O
I O
love O
it O
. O
  O
Do O
n't O
depend O
on O
what O
people O
have O
to O
say O
unless O
you O
try O
it O
. O
  O
Unless O
of O
course O
it O
is O
all O
bad O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
hair O
dryer O
at O
a O
great O
price O
. O
  O
My O
wife O
already O
had O
this O
one O
and O
has O
been O
using O
it O
for O
several O
years O
.. O
So O
when O
my O
other O
brand O
hair O
dryer O
died O
, O
I O
bought O
this O
one O
and O
so O
far O
so O
good O
. O
  O
I O
have O
been O
using O
it O
for O
about O
3 O
months O
now O
. O

Works O
great O

The O
picture O
of O
the O
product O
is O
deceptive O
. O
I O
bought O
it O
on O
Amazon O
and O
what O
I O
received O
was O
a O
very O
cheap O
looking O
product O
. O
The O
instructions O
on O
how O
to O
hang O
it O
on O
the O
wall O
is O
also O
very O
confusing O
. O
I O
am O
concerned O
about O
the O
safety O
of O
this O
product O
so O
I O
have O
stopped O
using O
it O
. O
Now O
I O
am O
left O
with O
a O
cheap O
dryer O
that O
I O
am O
never O
going O
to O
use O
. O
I O
wish O
I O
can O
return O
it O
back O
without O
paying O
a O
ton O
on O
shipping O
. O

Very O
powerful O
for O
a O
small O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
Bought O
this O
solely O
to O
use O
when O
I O
travel O
, O
because O
not O
all O
places O
provide O
a O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
But O
the O
places O
that O
do O
provide O
a O
hair O
dryer O
, O
the O
quality O
is O
poor O
. O
  O
So O
... O
bought O
one O
for O
myself O
and O
love O
it O
! O
  O
Especially O
the O
pink O
color O
and O
small O
little O
zebra O
print O
carrying O
case O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
hair O
dryer O
- O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
designed O
well O
. O
It O
's O
definitely O
pretty O
- O
does O
n't O
take O
up O
too O
much O
space O
. O
It O
has O
all O
the O
features O
that O
I O
need O
, O
like O
multiple O
heat O
settings O
, O
multiple O
air O
flow O
settings O
and O
even O
a O
cool O
blast O
to O
set O
the O
style O
. O
It O
fits O
standard O
hair O
dryer O
attachments O
too O
- O
  O
like O
a O
diffuser O
. O
It O
also O
comes O
with O
the O
attachment O
that O
focuses O
the O
air O
blast O
- O
I O
think O
it O
's O
called O
the O
nozzle O
, O
but O
it O
's O
key O
to O
minimizing O
damage O
on O
your O
hair O
. O
My O
last O
hair O
dryer O
( O
from O
a O
different O
brand O
) O
was O
closer O
to O
$ O
65 O
and O
although O
it O
worked O
great O
, O
it O
started O
to O
breakdown O
within O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
. O
It O
finally O
cracked O
it O
half O
in O
my O
checked O
bag O
during O
a O
recent O
flight O
. O
The O
price O
was O
right O
for O
this O
dryer O
- O
and O
I O
love O
the O
customer O
- O
centric O
focus O
of O
the O
company O
, O
xtava O
. O
I O
also O
love O
the O
follow O
up O
communication O

received O
after O
buying O

how O
to O
use O
it O
well O
, O
contact O

if O
I O

any O
problems O
. O
So O
, O
I O
'm O
happy O
with O
the O
dryer O
, O
but O
communication O
from O
xtava O
has O
been O
really O
great O
- O
the O
next O
time O
I O
'm O
in O
the O
market O
to O
buy O
something O
like O

love O
my O
Andis O
Ceramic O
blow O
dryer O
. O
Not O
only O
does O
it O
get O
our O
hair O
dry O
quickly O
but O
it O
also O
straightens O
at O
the O
Sam O

time O
. O
Ca O
n't O
get O
no O
better O
for O

Quick O

The O
best O
hair O

I O
ever O
used O
! O
! O

Very O
light O
weight O
, O
easy O
to O
use O
with O
one O
hand O
as O
you O
round O
brush O
with O
the O
other O
... O
and O
overall O
was O
above O
my O
expectations O
! O

Love O
this O
hairdryer O
! O
So O
fast O
and O
light O
. O
Cut O
styling O
time O
in O
half O

This O
is O
the O
best O
blow O
dryer O
I O
ever O
purchased O
. O
I O
have O
very O
thick O
long O
hair O
. O
With O
this O
dryer O
it O
dried O
in O
no O
time O

wonderful O
hair O
dryer O
and O
at O
a O
good O
price O

Great O
hair O
dryer O

Works O
great O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
. O
Broke O
. O
Decided O
to O
give O
a O
second O
chance O
because O
I O
loved O
how O
compact O
it O
is O
and O
it O
is O
off O
counter O
. O
I O
have O
had O
a O
new O
one O
for O
4 O
mos O
now O
and O
my O
2nd O
one O
broke O
. O
Says O
I O
can O
not O
return O
so O
now O
I O
am O
out O
2 O
dryers O
and O
spent O
over O
$ O
70 O
- O
will O
never O
buy O
another O
one O
. O
Terrible O
product O

For O
the O
price O
, O
this O
hair O
buyer O
is O
wonderful O
. O
My O
hair O
is O
seriously O
prone O
to O
being O
frizzy O
, O
and O
with O
( O
1 O
) O
being O
tourmaline O
ceramic O
, O
( O
2 O
) O
having O
a O
warm O
setting O
as O
well O
as O
a O
cool O
and O
hot O
, O
and O
( O
3 O
) O
having O
a O
concentrator O
, O
my O
hair O
has O
started O
acting O
much O
better O
. O
It O
's O
also O
fairly O
quiet O
. O
The O
lack O
of O
five O
stars O
is O
because O
it O
is O
n't O
particularly O
easy O
to O
store O
; O
it O
barely O
fits O
in O
the O
normal O
- O
size O
drawer O
, O
and O
including O
the O
diffuser O
, O
concentrator O
, O
and O
a O
hairbrush O
, O
it O
can O
be O
challenging O
to O
fit O
it O
in O
the O
drawer O
. O
Definitely O
a O
wonderful O
buy O
, O
though O
. O

TY O

excellent O

I O
used O
amazon O
prime O
and O
got O
this O
pretty O
fast O
. O
I O
have O
n't O
used O
it O
as O
yet O
but O
I O
did O
test O
the O
item O
and O
it O
works O
seemingly O
well O
... O
The O
barrel O
of O
the O
blowdryer O
works O
pretty O
well O
and O
the O
force O
of O
the O
air O
blown O
was O
great O
. O
However O
while O
inspecting O
this O
item O
it O
has O
scuff O
marks O
on O
the O
concentrator O
as O
if O
it O
had O
been O
used O
before O
or O
before O
being O
shipped O
. O
Not O
sure O
if O
it O
will O
lessen O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
force O
of O
the O
air O
over O
a O
period O
of O
time O
but O
we O
'll O
see O
. O
Also O
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
dryer O
there O
was O
a O
removable O
backing O
that O
allows O
for O
cleaning O
if O
the O
air O
vent O
gets O
clog O
, O
which O
I O
did O
n't O
expect O
and O
it O
was O
a O
pleasant O
supprise O
. O
The O
concentrator O
also O
takes O
quite O
a O
bit O
of O
strength O
to O
put O
on O
. O
( O
Twisting O
it O
on O
does O
n't O
make O
much O
sense O
so O
I O
'd O
recommend O
lining O
it O
up O
and O
the O
pushing O
it O
down O
on O
the O
barrel) O
... O
My O
intial O
review O
however O
is O
4stars O
. O
I O
will O
be O
doing O
an O
update O
within O
the O
next O
month O
.. O

I O
'm O
profesional O
hairstylist O
and O
i O
love O
it O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
hair O
dryer O
several O
years O
ago O
and O
really O
loved O
it O
, O
so O
when O
it O
stopped O
working O
recently O
due O
to O
a O
loose O
connection O
in O
the O
GFCI O
plug O
I O
knew O
I O
had O
to O
purchase O
it O
again O
. O
  O
The O
retractable O
cord O
is O
just O
brilliant O
-- O
every O
hair O
dryer O
should O
have O
this O
feature O
. O
  O
The O
cool O
shot O
button O
is O
handy O
to O
help O
set O
your O
style O
. O
  O
And O
the O
diffuser O
attachment O
is O
just O
* O
fabulous O
* O
, O
with O
air O
being O
directed O
in O
and O
through O
the O
prongs O
as O
well O
as O
around O
them O
to O
provide O
more O
even O
heat O
and O
air O
distribution O
. O
  O
I O
am O
so O
glad O
Conair O
is O
still O
making O
this O
model O
and O
that O
Amazon O
carries O
it O
. O

Powerful O
! O

It O
certainly O
works O
okay O
, O
but O
! O
It O
's O
very O
big O
, O
it O
's O
quite O
heavy O
and O
you O
'll O
need O
to O
have O
a O
good O
memory O
to O
remember O
all O
of O
the O
functions O
. O
I O
would O
say O
this O
one O
has O
been O
Over O
Engineered O
in O
the O
extreme O
and O
I O
'm O
sure O
as O
I O
will O
, O
many O
will O
go O
back O
to O
their O
lighter O
and O
simpler O
to O
use O
unit O
. O
A O
speed O
, O
cool O
and O
perhaps O
two O
or O
three O
heat O
settings O
are O
I O
'm O
sure O
is O
what O
most O
of O
us O
need O
and O
want O
and O
I O
feel O
this O
baby O
has O
just O
got O
too O
many O
functions O
to O
be O
practical O
. O
Luckily O
, O
I O
purchased O
this O
on O
a O
very O
special O
Amazon O
Deal O
, O
but O
truthfully O
I O
will O
just O
keep O
this O
one O
as O
a O
spare O
. O

Handy O

bright O

cheap O
light O
- O

plastic O
here O

Comes O

2 O

. O
Would O
be O
nice O
if O
it O
came O
with O
a O

It O

as O
it O
should O
be O
working O

I O
want O

not O
have O
a O

It O
is O
a O
little O
heavier O
than O
most O
hair O
dryers O
I O
have O
had O
. O
I O
like O
the O
fact O
that O
high O
heat O
does O
not O
burn O
and O
it O
has O
very O
powerful O
air O
flow O
. O
  O
Wish O
it O
wasa O
little O
lighter O

It O
is O
n't O
the O
stronger O
dryer O
I O
have O
used O
, O
but O
it O
is O
very O
adequate O
and O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
handle O
. O
The O
shipping O
was O
quick O
and O
perfect O
. O
So O
If O
your O
dryer O
dies O

a O
great O
substitute O

a O
super O
cute O
design O

use O
than O
my O
mom O
's O
expensive O
hair O
dryer O
. O

Yes O
it O
works O
great O

Spectacular O
, O
light O
- O
weight O
, O
compact O
and O
an O
outstanding O
price O
! O
  O
I O
purchased O
two O
! O
! O

ANOTHER O
BLOW O
DRYER O
THAT O
CAUSES O
FLYAWAY O
HAIR O
AND O
THE O
FRIZZIES O
! O
  O
I O
WISH O
SOMEONE O
KNEW O
OF O
A O
MINI O
DRYER O
THAT O
ACTUALLY O
STRAIGHTENS O
BANGS O
! O
  O
UNFORTUNATELY O
, O
THIS O
DRYER O
DOES O
NOT O
DO O
THE O
TRICK O
, O
I O
AM O
SORRY O
TO O
SAY O
! O

Burned O
out O
about O
4 O
months O
after O
I O
bought O
it O
. O
Total O
bummer O
. O
I O
have O
used O
Conait O
hair O
dryers O
for O
years O
and O
never O
had O
an O
issue O
before O
. O
This O
one O
was O
a O
bust O
:-( O

Low O
noise O
good O
hair O
dryer O

A O
little O
noisy O
, O
but O
powerful O
, O
small O
enough O
to O
pack O
. O
Cord O
is O
a O
bit O
on O
the O
short O
side O
, O
but O
it O
's O
perfect O
for O
my O
use O
. O

I O
like O
that O
this O
dryer O
provides O
greater O
heat O
than O
my O
1800 O
dryer O
, O
however O
it O
does O
n't O
put O
out O
as O
much O
power O
. O

Lasted O
only O
a O
few O
months O
before O
it O
died O
. O
Simply O
stopped O
working O
both O
the O
motor O
and O
the O
heating O
. O
During O
the O
time O
that O
it O
worked O
, O
average O
product O
. O
Not O
the O
best O
but O
not O
the O
worst O
. O

I O
had O
a O
Remington O
dryer O
before O
this O
that O
lasted O
5 O
years O
. O
I O
have O
thick O
, O
super O
long O
hair O
, O
so O
I O
needed O
something O
powerful O
that O
would O
n't O
leave O
my O
arms O
sore O
from O
an O
hour O
's O
worth O
of O
styling O
. O
My O
old O
hair O
dryer O
did O
the O
job O
in O
less O
than O
15 O
minutes O
- O
it O
was O
miraculous O
. O
The O
new O
line O
stinks O
, O
period O
. O
Instead O
of O
staying O
consistently O
hot O
, O
it O
cycles O
through O
heat O
settings O
( O
including O
cold O
) O
. O
The O
cord O
is O
also O
much O
shorter O
than O
before O
- O
a O
pain O
for O
tall O
women O
. O
The O
newest O
development O
with O
my O
dryer O
is O
sparks O
SHOOTING O
OUT O
from O
the O
dryer O
INTO O
my O
hair O
. O
Um O
, O
hello O
? O
! O
I O
've O
had O
this O
for O
8 O
months O
, O
and O
I O
use O
it O
anywhere O
from O
1 O
- O
3 O
times O
a O
week O
for O
20 O
minutes O
or O
less O
. O
Two O
stars O
because O
it O
is O
still O
fairly O
powerful O
, O
and O
drying O
time O
is O
n't O
insanely O
long O
. O
I O
want O
to O
love O
this O
dryer O
... O
I O
just O
wish O
the O
old O
version O
was O
still O
available O
. O

It O
is O
great O
I O
can O
dry O
my O
hair O
while O
I O
put O
on O
my O
makeup O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
find O
a O
blow O
dryer O
this O
would O
stay O
on O
without O
popping O
off O
. O
I O
went O
through O
about O
5 O
different O
ones O
. O

Just O
received O
, O
neither O
of O
the O
accessories O
would O
fit O
on O
the O
dryer O
. O
I O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
to O
anyone O
. O

Works O
fine O
. O

LoBe O
it O

works O
great O

Pleased O
with O
my O
new O
Conair O
hair O
dryer O
and O
the O
option O
for O
choices O
on O
level O
of O
drying O
. O
I O
am O
a O
little O
disappointed O
that O
occasionally O
the O
cord O
hangs O
up O
as O
it O
is O
retracting O
and O
is O
very O
difficult O
to O
start O
again O
. O

This O
works O
for O
me O
. O
I O
like O
a O
small O
hairdryer O
. O
It O
is O
plenty O
powerful O
and O
plenty O
pink O
! O

Great O
product O
! O

Worked O
perfect O
! O

Powerful O
and O
small O
. O
Like O
the O
compact O
convenience O
of O
it O
and O
am O
happy O
this O
dryer O
does O
n't O
take O
over O
my O
drawer O
space O
. O

exactly O
what O
I O
needed O
. O
love O
it O
. O

This O
is O
the O
best O
of O
hair O
dryer O
. O
Light O
weight O
, O
efficient O
, O
dual O
voltage O
and O
work O
fine O

I O
do O
n't O
believe O
the O
hair O
dryer O
is O
worth O
the O
price O
. O
All O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
it O
did O
not O
out O
perform O
my O
5 O
- O
year O
old O
, O
$ O
30 O
CONAIR O
that O
I O
purchased O
from O
Target O
. O

Good O
! O

Not O
as O
powerful O
as O
advertised O
. O
  O
Air O
force O
is O
weak O
. O
  O
For O
price O
you O
get O
what O
you O
get O
. O

i O
love O
my O
hair O
dryer O
. O
my O
hair O
does O
dry O
in O
less O
time O
. O

Works O
as O
well O
as O
more O
expensive O
products O
of O
similar O
type O
. O

I O
've O
owned O
and O
used O
this O
dryer O
daily O
for O
the O
last O
12 O
years O
. O
Works O
well O
on O
my O
wavy O
average O
thick O
hair O
. O
Its O
sturdy O
and O
dang O
near O
indestructible O
because O
its O
been O
dropped O
plenty O
of O
times O
. O
I O
've O
never O
considered O
getting O
a O
different O
one O
until O
recently O
, O
I O
think O
the O
motor O
is O
about O
to O
give O
up O
the O
ghost O
because O
it O
shoots O
out O
sparks O
( O
not O
to O
worry O
, O
I O
have O
not O
started O
on O
fire O
or O
lost O
any O
hair O
) O
but O
I O
am O
noticing O
more O
frizz O
than O
I O
have O
in O
the O
past O
. O
Only O
complaint O
is O
that O
the O
filter O
can O
not O
be O
completely O
removed O
to O
clean O
it O
out O
( O
has O
a O
cover O
but O
it O
does O
n't O
really O
do O
much O
, O
lots O
of O
lint O
still O
gets O
in O
there O
) O
. O
We O
have O
to O
use O
a O
q O
- O
tip O
and O
canned O
air O
spray O
to O
try O
and O
remove O
the O
lint O
. O
I O
am O
going O
to O
upgrade O
and O
see O
what O
that O
gets O
me O
. O
Buying O
: O
  O
Will O
let O
you O
know O
how O
it O
compares O
in O
a O
week O
or O
so O
. O

As O
an O
international O
traveler O
, O
I O
love O
the O
Dual O
Voltage O
! O
! O

The O
heat O
did O
not O
last O
for O
long O
, O
just O
cold O
air O
blows O
. O
  O
The O
dryer O
is O
stylish O
and O
the O
attachment O
does O
not O
fall O
off O
. O
  O
It O
is O
sad O
the O
heat O
stopped O
within O
a O
week O
. O

Dryer O
does O
not O
put O
out O
the O
heat O
as O
compared O
to O
the O
dryer O
it O
is O
replacing O
. O
  O
Blows O
strong O
but O
not O
hot O
enough O
. O
  O
The O
$ O
20 O
Conair O
at O
Costco O
puts O
out O
more O
heat O
than O
this O
product O
. O

This O
gives O
one O
choice O
of O
heat O
and O
power O
. O
It O
is O
fast O
and O
nice O

The O
locking O
mechanism O
on O
the O
hose O
is O
not O
stable O
enough O
to O
hold O
the O
hose O
securely O
. O
If O
I O
make O
a O
sudden O
move O
the O
hose O
pops O
off O

When O
this O
arrived O
i O
did O
n't O
even O
open O
it O
for O
a O
couple O
weeks O
, O
but O
as O
soon O
as O
i O
went O
to O
use O
it O
, O
it O
only O
blows O
cold O
air O
! O

Very O
light O
, O
fries O
my O
hair O
quickly O
. O
Like O
the O
cool O
button O
. O

Love O
it O
. O
Works O
great O
does O
nt O
over O
heat O
! O
Perfect O
buy O
! O

A O
couple O
of O
things O
to O
think O
about O
before O
buying O
this O
dryer O
. O
First O
, O
the O
cord O
is O
pretty O
short O
. O
It O
's O
about O
3 O
feet O
, O
and O
1/3 O
of O
it O
does O
not O
retract O
( O
by O
design O
) O
; O
so O
, O
about O
a O
foot O
of O
the O
cord O
hanging O
even O
when O
you O
are O
not O
using O
the O
dryer O
. O
Second O
, O
the O
there O
's O
no O
temperature O
setting O
, O
and O
the O
temperature O
is O
very O
low O
. O
If O
you O
have O
long O
hair O
, O
it O
takes O
a O
long O
time O
to O
dry O
it O
. O
For O
the O
price O
, O
this O
dryer O
is O
not O
bad O
, O
but O
for O
these O
reasons O
, O
I O
bought O
a O
different O
dryer O
. O
This O
dryer O
is O
now O
in O
the O
guess O
bathroom O
. O

I O
liked O
the O
hair O
dryer O
it O
. O
It O
is O
like O
the O
ones O
at O
the O
hair O
salon O
. O

My O
only O
complaint O
is O
that O
the O
extension O
does O
not O
clip O
on O
. O
Whenever O
I O
put O
the O
dryer O
away O
, O
the O
piece O
falls O
off O
and O
I O
have O
to O
go O
fishing O
for O
it O
. O
Other O
than O
that O
, O
it O
is O
light O
weight O
and O
cuts O
dry O
time O
. O
The O
highest O
heat O
setting O
is O
HOT O
. O

Love O
this O
blow O
dryer O
. O
  O
Hair O
so O
much O
easier O
to O
manage O
with O
this O
dryer O
than O
my O
old O
that O
just O
got O
hot O
. O

I O
loved O
it O

Hi O
, O
would O
have O
given O
it O
a O
5 O
- O
star O
, O
as O
it O
worked O
really O
well O
and O
was O
powerful O
yet O
quiet O
. O
  O
Unfortunately O
, O
not O
even O
a O
year O
old O
and O
with O
no O
warning O
, O
one O
day O
the O
on O
/ O
off O
switch O
no O
longer O
flicked O
on O
and O
off O
( O
like O
a O
spring O
had O
broken O
inside O
or O
something O
) O
and O
I O
had O
to O
throw O
it O
away O
. O
  O
Also O
, O
the O
filter O
is O
not O
easily O
accessible O
, O
like O
with O
some O
hair O
dryers O
that O
have O
a O
trap O
door O
that O
opens O
so O
you O
can O
reach O
them O
. O
  O
The O
only O
way O
to O
clean O
the O
filter O
is O
trying O
to O
shove O
a O
paper O
clip O
or O
pipe O
cleaner O
in O
between O
the O
vent O
slots O
and O
see O
if O
you O
can O
somehow O
pick O
the O
hair O
/ O
dust O
out O
of O
the O
filter O
. O

I O
had O
bought O
this O
blow O
dryer O
in O
a O
convenient O
store O
and O
loved O
it O
! O
  O
I O
went O
back O
and O
purchased O
an O
extra O
one O
for O
my O
guest O
bathroom O
for O
company O
to O
use O
. O
  O
Our O
family O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
birthdays O
in O
March O
and O
I O
thought O
this O
would O
be O
a O
great O
gift O
for O
my O
daughters O
. O
  O
The O
convenient O
store O
did O
not O
have O
any O
of O
these O
left O
, O
so O
I O
went O
to O
my O
Trusty O
Amazon O
and O
bought O
two O
from O
them O
. O
All O
of O
our O
daughters O
have O
waist O
length O
to O
knee O
length O
hair O
and O
I O
have O
very O
thick O
and O
long O
hair O
and O
it O
takes O
us O
30 O
to O
45 O
mins O
with O
other O
dryers O
to O
dry O
our O
hair O
. O
  O
This O
blow O
dryer O
does O
my O
hair O
in O
15 O
mins O
. O
  O
I O
love O
this O
thing O
! O
! O
  O
We O
do O
n't O
understand O
how O
some O
say O
they O
get O
their O
long O
hair O
stuck O
at O
the O
intake O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
blow O
dryer O
because O
most O
women O
do O
not O
have O
knee O
length O
hair O
and O
we O
have O
never O
had O
this O
issue O
. O
  O
If O
you O
want O
a O
powerful O
blow O
dryer O
, O
this O
is O
the O
one O
for O
you O
.. O

Nice O
hairdryer O
. O
Simple O
and O
solid O
. O
I O
use O
mine O
for O
drying O
off O
my O
goldendoodle O
when O
she O
's O
been O
out O
in O
the O
rain O
. O

I O
really O
like O
it O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
reasons O
. O
The O
size O
and O
also O
the O
blower O
, O
it O
is O
the O
best O
I O
have O
ever O
used O
. O
One O
problem O
, O
I O
had O
one O
before O
this O
order O
and O
it O
only O
lasted O
a O
year O
. O

Great O
seller O
and O
great O
product O
, O
this O
hair O
dryer O
is O
manageable O
and O
leaves O
my O
hair O
perfect O
. O
The O
drier O
is O
a O
bit O
heavy O
but O
other O
than O
that O
, O
perfect O
size O
and O
it O
makes O
wonders O

great O
for O
the O
guest O
room O

Works O
really O
well O
, O
and O
fun O
colors O

For O
commercial O
setting O
they O
are O
neat O
and O
clean O
but O
with O
heavy O
everyday O
use O
they O
get O
about O
1 O
- O
1.5 O
years O
before O
burning O
out O
. O
Very O
happy O
with O
the O
product O
and O
would O
recommend O
them O
to O
other O
businesses O
. O
I O
will O
be O
purchasing O
more O
in O
the O
future O
! O

The O
hairdryer O
was O
good O
while O
it O
lasted O
but O
has O
now O
burnt O
out O
. O
Dead O
in O
under O

for O
$ O
26.75 O
two O

seems O
tripple O
the O

How O

possible O
? O

Great O
product O
! O

Excellent O
hair O
dryer O

I O
love O

because O
I O
can O
get O
very O
high O
heat O
on O
a O
low O
or O
high O

quickly O
on O
the O

Easy O

.... O
if O

It O
would O
stop O
half O
way O
through O
drying O
( O
and O
it O
takes O
less O
then O
ten O
minutes O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
) O
and O
I O
would O
have O
to O
let O
it O
cool O
off O
before O
it O
would O
restart O
. O
Glad O
I O
never O
mounted O
it O
. O

Just O
what O
I O
was O
wanting O
! O
! O
! O

Work O
really O
nice O
is O
awesome O
. O
..... O

I O
bought O
this O
exact O
hairdryer O
more O
than O
5 O
years O
ago O
and O
I O
had O
to O
buy O
it O
again O
. O
It O
's O
efficient O
and O
travels O
well O
! O

I O
wish O
I O
had O
this O
dryer O
forever O
! O

Love O
, O
love O
, O
love O
it O
! O
! O
! O
Very O
comfortable O
to O
use O
, O
controls O
in O
the O
right O
spot O
and O
dries O
my O
hair O
quickly O
and O
leaves O
it O
smooth O
and O
shiny O
! O
! O
! O
VERY O
happy O
! O
! O
! O
And O
it O
has O
sparkles O
... O
:D O

I O
have O
always O
had O
excellent O
luck O
with O
Conair O
hair O
dryers O
. O
  O
My O
previous O
one O
lasted O
over O
five O
years O
! O
  O
I O
have O
been O
using O
this O
one O
for O
a O
week O
so O
far O
and O
I O
love O
it O
. O
  O
It O
is O
lightweight O
and O
dries O
your O
hair O
quickly O
( O
without O
making O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
are O
going O
through O
a O
wind O
tunnel O
) O
. O
  O
It O
is O
a O
little O
smaller O
than O
my O
old O
dryer O
, O
so O
it O
would O
also O
be O
useful O
for O
travel O
. O
  O
Very O
nice O
. O

The O
dryer O
works O
great O
. O
  O
The O
only O
reason O
for O
not O
5 O
stars O
is O
the O
cord O
retraction O
. O
  O
It O
sometimes O
takes O
three O
times O
to O
get O
the O
cord O
to O
retract O
fully O
. O

EXCELLENT O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
tiny O
size O
for O
traveling O
, O
but O
I O
returned O
it O
because O
it O
does O
not O
have O
a O
cool O
shot O
button O
. O

Really O
nice O
product O
, O
but O
some O
times O
the O
cord O
retainer O
button O
not O
working O
properly O

I O
bought O
this O
because O
my O
older O
Conair O
caught O
on O
fire O
one O
morning O
, O
after O
about O
6 O
years O
of O
use O
. O
I O
needed O
something O
quick O
and O
inexpensive O
. O
That O
is O
what O
this O
is O
. O
The O
diffuser O
is O
not O
well O
conceived O
, O
the O
directional O
is O
poorly O
done O
. O
The O
airflow O
is O
slow O
, O
and O
the O
dryer O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
get O
hot O
enough O
. O
This O
worked O
well O
enough O
in O
a O
pinch O
, O
but O
is O
not O
my O
recommended O
choice O
for O
everyday O
use O
. O

Very O
nice O
. O
I O
love O
the O
different O
heat O
settings O
and O
the O
noise O
level O
is O
really O
low O
compared O
to O
my O
old O
Conair O
hair O
dryer O

It O
is O
tiny O
and O
lightweight O
but O
very O
powerful O
. O
It O
is O
perfect O
for O
travel O
. O

Does O
n't O
over O
dry O
my O
hair O
! O
  O
Love O
it O
! O

The O
only O
reason O
why O
I O
bought O
this O
blow O
dryer O
was O
that O
my O
other O
hair O
dryer O
gave O
out O
on O
me O
and O
due O
highly O
to O
the O
reviews O
. O
  O
The O
positive O
reviews O
were O
right O
on O
with O
the O
product O
. O
  O
I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
product O
to O
the O
3 O
settings O
for O
your O
hair O
and O
the O
add O
- O
on O
. O

Momma O
loved O
it O
:) O

This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
light O
weight O
and O
works O
awesome O
! O
I O
love O
the O
multiple O
settings O
and O
the O
size O
for O
travel O
. O
So O
far O
no O
issues O
. O

Great O
little O
Hair O
Dryer O
! O
! O
It O
quickly O
dries O
even O
a O
lot O
of O
Hair O
. O

Works O
well O
! O

I O
really O
like O
th O
hair O
dryer O
! O
It O
drys O
fast O
and O

my O
hair O
look O
great O
! O
Highly O
recommended O
! O

very O
good O
working O
and O
I O
like O
me O
hear O
after O
the O
ions O

Excellent O
, O
but O
noisier O
than O
I O
thought O
. O

Best O
hairdryer O
I O
've O
ever O
had O
, O
love O
the O
ease O
of O
cord O
retraction O
. O

Great O
product O
! O
The O
only O
bad O
thing O
was O
that O
the O
wheels O
did O
n't O
fit O
. O

Works O
fine O
, O
I O
just O
wish O
there O
was O
a O
cool O
setting O
for O
those O
hot O
days O
you O
have O
to O
blow O
dry O
your O
hair O
. O
It O
also O
seems O
like O
it O
does O
n't O
get O
as O
hot O
as O
my O
other O
hair O
dryer O
this O
size O
. O

This O
works O
great O
. O
We O
've O
had O
it O
a O
few O
years O
now O
and O
still O
going O
strong O
. O

Has O
great O
power O
- O
just O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
. O

Bought O
this O
for O
$ O
20 O
on O
Amazon O
( O
sale O
? O
) O
. O
  O
Nice O
and O
quiet O
compared O
to O
the O
one O
my O
wife O
used O
to O
use O
. O
  O
I O
'm O
surprised O
more O
women O
do O
n't O
have O
hearing O
loss O
from O
all O
the O
noise O
of O
these O
things O
. O

Gets O
my O
hair O
dry O
. O
Folds O
up O
neatly O
. O
But O
it O
did O
n't O
do O
anything O
extra O
special O
to O
my O
hair O
. O
It O
's O
a O
hair O
dryer O
... O
and O
it O
dried O
my O
hair O
. O
It O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
n O
fits O
in O
my O
luggage O
. O
So O
it O
does O
what O
it O
's O
supposed O
to O
do O
. O

Lots O
of O
power O
, O
works O
great O
, O
hair O
does O
n't O
seem O
as O
dry O
after O
using O
. O
  O
Would O
definitely O
buy O
again O
. O

The O
heat O
setting O
is O
only O
two O
it O
said O
it O
would O
have O
four O
not O
happy O

Worked O
great O
with O
adapter O
. O
  O
Just O
follow O
instructions O
on O
proper O
settings O
. O

Tons O
of O
power O
! O
I O
love O
this O
blow O
dryer O
! O
Worth O
the O
higher O
price O
! O

Lightweight O
and O
efficient O
. O
This O
is O
a O
good O
buy O
on O
a O
solid O
dryer O
that O
should O
last O
for O
years O
. O

granddaughter O
loves O
it O

good O

Very O
Good O

Love O
our O
hair O
dryers O
. O
They O
are O
out O
of O
the O
way O
yet O
within O
reach O
. O

This O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
hair O
dryer O
I O
have O
ever O
owned O
! O
  O
I O
have O
curly O
hair O
and O
have O
found O
that O
the O
diffuser O
that O
comes O
with O
it O
is O
the O
best O
for O
making O
my O
hair O
have O
the O
best O
curls O
. O
  O
I O
had O
actually O
purchased O
two O
other O
hair O
dryers O
( O
one O
specifically O
for O
curly O
hair O
) O
and O
they O
did O
n't O
work O
at O
all O
! O
  O
The O
diffuser O
on O
this O
dryer O
is O
the O
perfect O
size O
to O
get O
all O
of O
my O
thick O
hair O
. O
  O
Not O
only O
that O
, O
the O
hair O
dryer O
does O
n't O
blow O
my O
hair O
all O
around O
when O
trying O
to O
get O
the O
right O
curls O
. O
  O
I O
also O
love O
the O
cool O
setting O
feature O
on O
the O
dryer O
. O
  O
You O
wo O
n't O
regret O
purchasing O
this O
hair O
dryer O
! O

good O

Sturdy O
, O
not O
heavy O
and O
easy O
to O
use O
. O

Great O
. O

Good O
product O

The O
dryer O
works O
very O
well O
. O
The O
only O
issue O
I O
have O
is O
, O
the O
bonnet O
is O
a O
bit O
small O
and O
it O
's O
too O
tight O
. O
There O
is O
no O
way O
to O
loosen O
the O
string O
. O

Use O
it O
in O
a O
Motor O
Home O
and O
works O
great O
. O

Works O
great O
. O
  O
Compact O
. O

I O
'm O
a O
professional O
and O
have O
used O
this O
dryer O
daily O
for O
years O
. O
Mine O
recently O
died O
so O
bought O
another O
one O
. O
Reasonable O
price O
too O
. O

excellent O
: O
compact O
and O
very O
powerful O
. O

dries O
your O
hair O
very O
quickly O
, O
I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
product O

Seems O
to O
work O
okay O
. O
I O
have O
n't O
really O
had O
the O
chance O
to O
try O
it O
out O
yet O
. O
I O
pulled O
it O
out O
of O
the O
box O
and O
tested O
it O
, O
so O
for O
now O
its O
okay O
. O
The O
hair O
dryer O
and O
attachments O
are O
much O
smaller O
than O
I O
imagined O
. O
Its O
a O
normal O
size O
hair O
dryer O
, O
however O
I O
'm O
used O
to O
a O
much O
bigger O
one O
by O
Revlon O
. O
Hopefully O
this O
one O
matches O
up O
well O
to O
the O
standards O
of O
the O
Revlon O
products O
. O
I O
figured O
I O
could O
n't O
beat O
the O
price O
.... O

Good O

good O
buy O
for O
the O
money O
. O
  O
Works O
perfectly O
. O

It O
's O
ok O
but O
I O
was O
expecting O
it O
to O
have O
more O
power O
. O
Very O
expensive O
and O
same O
power O
as O
the O
previos O
model O
. O
I O
kept O
it O
because O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
time O
to O
shop O
around O
, O
otherwise O
, O
it O
would O
had O
gone O
back O
. O

This O
hair O
dryer O
worked O
perfectly O
on O
my O
recent O
trip O
to O
Holland O
, O
Belgium O
, O
France O
, O
and O
England O
. O
  O
There O
was O
no O
converter O
needed O
, O
just O
an O
outlet O
adapter O
when O
switched O
on O
the O
250 O
V O
mode O
and O
used O
only O
on O
the O
low O
setting O
. O
  O
To O
clarify O
, O
you O
can O
ONLY O
use O
it O
on O
the O
LOW O
setting O
, O
however O
on O
the O
low O
setting O
it O
runs O
like O
it O
is O
on O
high O
- O
very O
easy O
, O
and O
worked O
perfectly O
. O
  O
It O
is O
also O
extremely O
compact O
for O
easy O
packing O
, O
but O
still O
worked O
like O
a O
bigger O
, O
nice O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
Hope O
this O
helps O
someone O
:) O

Met O
my O
expectations O
. O

GIVEN O
AS O
A O
GIFT O
AT O
CHRISTMAS O
... O
AWESOME O
PRODUCT O
, O
MY O
SISTER O
LOVES O
IT O
AND O
SHE O
HAS O
EXTREMELY O
FRIZZY O
HAIR O
. O

I O
realized O
a O
bit O
too O
late O
in O
my O
adult O
life O
that O
a O
good O
blow O
- O
dryer O
makes O
all O
the O
difference O
in O
the O
look O
and O
feel O
of O
your O
hair O
. O
I O
simply O
could O
not O
figure O
out O
why O
my O
hair O
was O
always O
kind O
of O
sticky O
and O
not O
quite O
fully O
dry O
when O
I O
got O
out O
of O
the O
shower O
and O
tried O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
with O
my O
5 O
+ O
year O
old O
Conair O
that O
I O
bought O
at O
CVS O
very O
inexpensively O
. O
I O
did O
some O
research O
online O
and O
scoffed O
at O
the O
$ O
150 O
+ O
dryers O
that O
were O
being O
promoted O
. O
This O
one O
was O
on O
the O
list O
, O
and O
honestly O
, O
given O
the O
relatively O
lower O
price O
point O
versus O
the O
other O
professional O
dryers O
, O
I O
was O
willing O
to O
try O
it O
out O
. O
WOW O
. O
I O
have O
used O
it O
now O
about O
3 O
times O
, O
and O
it O
is O
hard O
to O
believe O
what O
a O
significant O
difference O
I O
see O
in O
my O
hair O
. O
I O
styled O
it O
myself O
for O
a O
formal O
Gala O
event O
, O
and O
was O
able O
to O
achieve O
the O
shiny O
look O
, O
feel O
, O
and O
volume O
in O
my O
hair O
that O
any O
professional O
stylist O
could O
achieve O
. O
It O
was O
unreal O
. O
Even O
on O
a O
work O
day O
I O
feel O
so O
much O
better O
about O
myself O
having O
simply O
styled O
my O
hair O
with O
this O
blow O
dryer O
. O
It O
targets O
the O
hot O
hair O
wonderfully O
and O
leaves O
my O
hair O
so O
dry O
, O
shiny O
and O
healthy O
. O
I O
went O

The O
other O
other O
issue O
is O
the O
on O

off O
switch O

the O
temperature O
level O
are O
too O
close O

the O
buttons O
switch O
on O
and O
off O
all O
the O
time O

Bonnet O
was O
very O
tight O
around O
the O
head O
. O
I O
took O
the O
elastic O
out O
and O
replaced O
it O
with O
some O
1/4 O
inch O
elastic O
material O
purchased O
from O
Walmart O
, O
taping O
it O
to O
some O
automotive O
wire O
and O
threading O
through O
the O
bonnet O
. O
Now O
my O
wife O
likes O
it O
very O
much O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
hair O
dryer O
after O
it O
was O
recommended O
by O
a O
friend O
. O
  O
I O
absolutely O
love O
it O
! O
  O
I O
have O
long O
hair O
and O
have O
never O
been O
able O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
as O
quickly O
as O
I O
can O
with O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
I O
ca O
n't O
say O
enough O
good O
things O
about O
it O
and O
highly O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
! O

We O
bought O
two O
wall O
mount O
hairdryers O
to O
install O
at O
a O
vacation O
rental O
. O
  O
They O
work O
well O
and O
are O
attractive O
. O
  O
They O
are O
small O
, O
do O
n't O
take O
up O
too O
much O
wall O
space O
and O
leaves O
the O
counter O
top O
clear O
. O
  O
It O
was O
a O
good O
choice O
for O
us O
. O

As O
a O
bald O
man O
, O
I O
love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
It O
helps O
my O
wife O
dry O
her O
hair O
in O
a O
fair O
amount O
of O
time O
, O
less O
than O
her O
previous O
hair O
dryer O
. O
Seems O
to O
work O
pretty O
good O
. O
Typically O
loud O
when O
on O
, O
so O
I O
leave O
the O
room O
. O
Also O
, O
of O
note O
, O
this O
hair O
dryer O
does O
not O
have O
an O
actual O
turbo O
despite O
the O
product O
description O
. O
I O
feel O
like O
this O
is O
either O
false O
advertising O
and O
I O
have O
been O
duped O
, O
or O
the O
seller O
has O
no O
idea O
what O
the O
hell O
a O
turbo O
actually O
is O
. O
Turbos O
are O
found O
on O
internal O
combustion O
engines O
, O
both O
gasoline O
and O
diesel O
. O
If O
' O
turbo O
' O
is O
meant O
to O
mean O
something O
like O
strong O
wind O
, O
they O
should O
have O
used O
a O
word O
like O
Kyufu O
, O
which O
is O
Japanese O
for O
strong O
wind O
. O
Or O
maybe O
the O
German O
word O
for O
hair O
dryer O
, O
which O
is O
fohn O
. O
Either O
way O
, O
do O
n't O
be O
fooled O
. O
There O
is O
no O
actual O
turbo O
, O
quiet O
fan O
and O
motor O
is O
subjective O
. O
It O
is O
loud O
. O
And O
I O
have O
not O
tested O
the O
lifeline O
shock O
protection O
. O
I O
would O
hope O
it O
works O
, O
but O
after O
the O
other O
misleading O
information O
, O
your O
results O
may O
vary O
. O

I O
m O
a O
hairstylist O
. O
I O
have O
2 O
of O
these O
. O
Super O
light O
and O
dries O
great O
. O
Not O
loud O
either O
! O

Compact O
and O
easy O
to O
use O

My O
daughter O
says O
that O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
use O
and O
is O
fine O
. O

Great O
purchase O
! O
Works O
perfectly O
. O

little O
bit O
heavier O
than O
expected O
. O

Love O
it O
.... O

I O
love O
my O
new O
Rusk O
! O
It O
is O
a O
little O
heavier O
than O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
, O
but O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
hold O
. O
The O
4 O
attachments O
make O
any O
style O
possible O
. O

The O
hair O
dryer O
is O
quiet O
and O
powerful O
enough O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
, O
however O
, O
the O
on O
/ O
off O
switch O
stopped O
working O
the O
first O
day O
. O
I O
did O
not O
want O
to O
go O
through O
taking O
it O
off O
the O
wall O
and O
send O
it O
back O
so O
I O
am O
using O
this O
item O
by O
plugging O
and O
unplugging O
the O
hair O
dryer O
as O
needed O
for O
use O
. O
The O
switch O
should O
last O
years O
, O
but O
did O
n't O
even O
work O
for O
one O
day O
. O

LOVE O
this O
hairdyer O
! O
! O
  O
Dries O
my O
hair O
in O
half O
the O
time O
, O
is O
so O
quiet O
and O
light O
in O
weight O
. O
  O
My O
girlfriend O
has O
owned O
this O
dryer O
for O
years O
and O
always O
has O
it O
with O
her O
when O
we O
travel O
together O
. O
  O
After O
our O
last O
vacation O
together O
I O
decided O
it O
was O
time O
I O
owned O
my O
own O
! O

So O
far O
used O
only O
one O
time O
, O
but O
I O
liked O
how O
it O
handled O
and O
it O
did O
a O
good O
job O
. O

I O
'm O
so O
glad O
that O
I O
finally O
got O
one O
of O
these O
for O
home O
. O
Works O
really O
well O
, O
not O
too O
loud O
and O
my O
hair O
does O
n't O
feel O
fried O
like O
a O
hand O
- O
dryer O
. O
My O
only O
suggestion O
is O
getting O
a O
weight O
to O
add O
to O
the O
base O
because O
it O
can O
tip O
over O
easier O
than O
it O
should O
. O

It O
made O
my O
hair O
very O
puffy O
... O
very O
, O
very O
, O
way O
too O
puffy O

Yes O
the O
blow O
dryer O
works O
well O
to O
dry O
my O
  O
hair O
, O
but O
it O
did O
n't O
leave O
my O
hair O
smooth O
without O
frizz O
. O
It O
was O
also O
awkward O
to O
handle O
, O
the O
nozzle O
is O
long O
. O
I O
will O
go O
back O
to O
my O
old O
hair O
dryer O
! O

Dry O
that O
hair O
for O
less O
than O
$ O
13 O
... O

This O
is O
a O
wonderful O
hair O
dryer O
. O
I O
would O
recommend O
to O
anyone O
. O

If O
you O
want O
it O
to O
de O
- O
frizz O
and O
smooth O
your O
hair O
and O
straighten O
it O
then O
it O
is O
a O
5 O
star O
purchase O
. O

well O
, O
it O
just O
did O
n't O
turn O
on O
after O
a O
year O
of O

. O
it O
was O
n't O

or O
near O
to O
a O
water O
or O
anything O
that O
might O
've O
caused O
it O
to O
malfunction O
. O
As O
i O
was O
getting O

did O
n't O
turn O
on O
. O
i O
tried O
to O
troubleshoot O
it O
, O
reset O

use O
a O
different O
plug O

working O
for O
about O
six O

My O
only O
complaint O

I O

like O

I O
love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
! O
I O
have O
long O
, O
natural O
hair O
. O
I O
used O
to O
blow O
dry O
and O
flat O
iron O
my O
hair O
until O
it O
started O
breaking O
and O
looking O
* O
dead O
* O
. O
I O
heard O
about O
this O
dryer O
on O
You O
Tube O
from O
Sista O
with O
Real O
Hair O
. O
I O
ordered O
and O
received O
it O
within O
3 O
- O
4 O
days O
. O
No O
more O
blow O
drying O
for O
me O
. O
Great O
Price O
too O
! O

When O
I O
touched O
the O
box O
I O
knew O
right O
then O
and O
there O
that O
something O
does O
n't O
feel O
right O
. O
It O
did O
n't O
feel O
like O
a O
brand O
new O
box O
and O
when O
I O
opened O
it O
up O
my O
suspicion O
was O
confirmed O
. O
I O
have O
received O
a O
used O
or O
return O
product O
when O
I O
paid O
for O
a O
new O
one O
. O
The O
hair O
dryer O
had O
marks O
on O
it O
from O
previous O
use O
. O
I O
'm O
not O
happy O
about O
this O
. O
  O
UPDATE O
: O
I O
decided O
to O
use O
it O
anyways O
but O
it O
would O
n't O
even O
work O
. O
I O
tried O
resetting O
and O
testing O
it O
but O
it O
wo O
n't O
even O
turn O
on O
. O
The O
buttons O
are O
very O
cheaply O
made O
. O
When O
I O
moved O
the O
buttons O
it O
felt O
like O
it O
would O
fall O
apart O
. O
Very O
disappointed O
. O

I O
use O
it O
daily O
. O
It O
's O
good O
and O
value O
for O
money O
. O

Do O
yourself O
a O
favor O
and O
buy O
this O
right O
now O
. O

It O
's O
a O
really O
good O
value O
for O
the O
money O
. O
  O
It O
is O
a O
bit O
heavier O
than O
I O
am O
used O
to O
and O
if O
just O
got O
s O
bit O
hotter O
it O
would O
be O
perfect O

This O
is O
the O
best O
compact O
hairdryer O
i O
ever O
purchased O
. O
So O
much O
power O
. O

A O
good O
piece O
of O
kit O
. O
I O
chose O
it O
for O
my O
wife O
she O
loves O
it O
. O
So O
powerful O
that O
she O
rarely O
uses O
it O
on O
full O
power O
( O
2 O
wiggles O
) O

I O
love O
this O
dryer O
. O
  O
I O
purchased O
about O
3 O
weeks O
ago O
and O
have O
used O
it O
almost O
every O
other O
day O
since O
I O
bought O
it O
. O
  O
It O
dries O
extremely O
fast O
in O
the O
morning O
so O
it O
allows O
me O
to O
not O
have O
to O
blow O
dry O
which O
is O
essential O
with O
African O
American O
hair O
and O
relaxers O
to O
prevent O
dryness O
. O
The O
settings O
are O
great O
and O
It O
is O
super O
quiet O
which O
is O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
. O
  O
Those O
are O
all O
definite O
positives O
. O
  O
However O
, O
I O
would O
have O
to O
agree O
with O
one O
of O
the O
other O
reviewers O
. O
  O
It O
is O
extremely O
top O
heavy O
and O
I O
had O
the O
same O
problem O
in O
that O
yesterday O
it O
fell O
over O
and O
the O
visor O
in O
the O
front O
broke O
. O
  O
Now O
I O
am O
hoping O
I O
can O
find O
someone O
that O
replaces O
the O
part O
as O
the O
part O
is O
screwed O
in O
and O
if O
that O
is O
the O
case O
then O
this O
would O
possibly O
increase O
my O
score O
a O
little O
but O
you O
still O
have O
the O
problem O
of O
it O
falling O
over O
in O
the O
future O
. O
  O
If O
I O
can O
not O
find O
a O
part O
to O
replace O
it O
online O
then O
I O
would O
drop O
this O
review O
to O
a O
2 O
or O
1 O
since O
it O
does O
n't O
work O
as O
well O
without O
the O
visor O
keeping O
the O
heat O
in O
. O

Nice O
hair O
dryer O
but O
very O
heavy O
. O

Ok O
.... O
It O
really O
dosent O
get O
that O
hot O
. O

Great O
hair O
dryer O
. O

complaints O

This O
is O
great O
! O
! O
! O

's O
really O
pretty O
and O
useful O
! O
The O
delivery O
is O
fast O
! O
Thanks O

The O
power O
of O
the O
dryer O
seems O
less O
than O
I O
would O
have O
thought O
. O
  O
Still O
nice O
. O

Great O
hair O
dryer O
! O
Shipping O
was O
very O
fast O
! O

Love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O

This O
blow O
dryer O
seemed O
to O
be O
just O
what O
I O
wanted O
, O
but O
was O
a O
huge O
disappointment O
. O
  O
It O
is O
very O
loud O
as O
I O
think O
one O
reviewer O
stated O
. O
  O
That O
I O
could O
deal O
with O
but O
that O
was O
just O
one O
small O
detail O
. O
  O
The O
attachment O
for O
the O
hair O
curling O
I O
could O
not O
work O
, O
although O
that O
may O
just O
be O
me O
. O
  O
The O
settings O
for O
the O
hot O
and O
cold O
on O
this O
are O
right O
at O
the O
finger O
tips O
where O
you O
hold O
the O
dryer O
. O
  O
Therefore O
, O
if O
you O
are O
not O
careful O
you O
will O
be O
drying O
on O
warm O
instead O
of O
high O
. O
  O
You O
start O
wondering O
why O
its O
not O
getting O
dry O
. O
  O
I O
have O
had O
to O
change O
it O
back O
as O
many O
as O
20 O
times O
in O
one O
hair O
drying O
session O
. O
  O
And O
now O
the O
last O
and O
& O
most O
frustrating O
feature O
of O
the O
dryer O
. O
  O
The O
concentrated O
hair O
drying O
attachment O
that O
was O
stated O
in O
the O
description O
of O
the O
product O
as O
coming O
off O
for O
easy O
cleaning O
, O
unlike O
most O
other O
models O
. O
  O
Well O
yes O
, O
it O
does O
come O
off O
for O
easy O
cleaning O
alright O
, O
it O
just O
blows O
it O
across O
the O
room O
as O
you O
are O
drying O
your O
hair O
. O
  O
You O
just O
do O
n't O
want O
anyone O
else O
in O
the O
room O
with O
you O
for O
you O
never O
know O
where O
the O
line O
of O
fire O
may O
be O
. O
  O
It O
blows O
off O
with O
quite O
a O
force O
so O
I O
am O
sure O
it O
would O
hurt O
someone O
, O
particularly O
a O
small O
child O
. O
  O
I O
owned O
a O
Vidal O
Sassoon O
Dryer O
before O
but O
never O
one O
like O
this O
. O
  O
I O
can O
not O
recommend O
this O
product O
and O
will O
not O
purchase O
another O
one O
of O
this O
brand O
. O
  O
It O
was O
inexpensive O
so O
I O
guess O
its O
true O
, O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
. O
  O
Not O
worth O
paying O
return O
shipping O
so O
I O
use O
it O
as O
it O
is O
until O
my O
new O
one O
arrives O
. O

Amazing O
dryer O
! O
! O
It O
has O
cut O
my O
drying O
time O
down O
significantly O
. O
I O
have O
really O
curly O
hair O
& O
this O
dryer O
works O
very O
well O
with O
my O
diffuser O
. O
I O
think O
it O
is O
a O
great O
value O
for O
the O
money O
and O
I O
'm O
so O
happy O
with O
my O
purchase O
! O

Very O
nice O
and O
easy O
to O
use O
. O
  O
Works O
great O
! O

So O
powerful O
and O
light O
, O
for O
that O
price O
it O
left O
behind O
all O
expensive O
Italian O
hairdryers O

the O
quality O
is O
very O
good O

Love O
this O
dryer O
especially O
the O
cool O
setting O
which O
I O
use O
for O
the O
first O
week O
after O
I O
color O
my O
hair O
. O
  O
It O
's O
lightweight O
and O
does O
n't O
make O
a O
lot O
of O
noise O
. O

Another O
device O
that O
is O
a O
powerhouse O
in O
a O
small O
package O
. O
  O
I O
had O
a O
very O
expensive O
white O
designer O
hairdresser O
before O
this O
and O
it O
still O
took O
forever O
to O
dry O
hair O
, O
and O
got O
so O
hot O
doing O
so O
that O
kids O
and O
pets O
yowl O
. O
  O
This O
dryer O
works O
in O
record O
time O
, O
blows O
the O
moisture O
out O
like O
those O
car O
dryer O
things O
at O
the O
car O
wash O
, O
and O
does O
n't O
burn O
hair O
or O
scalp O
doing O
so O
. O
  O
It O
is O
also O
fairly O
quiet O
for O
the O
power O
. O
  O
I O
am O
not O
a O
pro O
hairdresser O
so O
ca O
n't O
speak O
for O
that O
, O
but O
for O
the O
family O
bath O
night O
, O
it O
is O
fast O
without O
the O
  O
furious O
. O

Product O
arrived O
in O
perfect O
condition O
and O
have O
had O
no O
issues O
since O
it O
arrived O
. O
  O
It O
was O
packaged O
very O
sustainably O
and O
safely O
. O
Am O
very O
satisfied O
with O
customer O
service O
. O
  O
Totally O
worth O
the O
wait!My O
girlfriend O
absolutely O
loved O
this O
as O
a O
gift O
! O
She O
said O
the O
dryer O
is O
powerful O
enough O
but O
not O
hot O
enough O
to O
damage O
hair O
will O
leaving O
smooth O
hair O
and O
preventing O
split O
ends O
from O
fraying O
from O
the O
intense O
heat O
of O
a O
competitor O
. O
  O
If O
you O
have O
a O
significant O
other O
with O
delicate O
hair O
this O
is O
definitely O
worth O
the O
price O
and O
wait O
. O
  O
It O
will O
pay O
itself O
back O
in O
no O
time!I O
say O
it O
's O
worth O
the O
wait O
because O
you O
either O
have O
to O
save O
up O
enough O
money O
to O
purchase O
an O
item O
of O
this O
caliber O
and O
also O
because O
it O
is O
manufactured O
in O
Italy O
and O
takes O
about O
two O
weeks O
to O
arrive O

Great O
dryer O
. O
It O
dried O
my O
hair O
in O
under O
10 O
min O
. O
And O
I O
have O
thick O
hair O
that O
reaches O
my O
bum O
. O
Powerful O
, O
my O
leave O
your O
hair O
a O
little O
frizzed O
. O

Love O
having O
my O
hair O
dryer O
so O
handy O
. O

As O
a O
professional O
makeup O
artist O
and O
hair O
stylist O
I O
invest O
in O
a O
lot O
of O
products O
. O
This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
really O
not O
my O
favorite O
. O
I O
usually O
hold O
it O
by O
the O
base O
when O
I O
'm O
drying O
a O
client O
's O
hair O
but O
it O
gets O
so O
hot O
that O
I O
have O
to O
hold O
it O
by O
the O
handle O
, O
but O
when O
I O
do O
that O
I O
'm O
touching O
all O
the O
buttons O
and O
turning O
stuff O
on O
and O
off O
on O
accident O
. O
Also O
, O
the O
part O
that O
holds O
the O
filter O
on O
the O
back O
of O
the O
dryer O
keeps O
falling O
off O
that O
I O
had O
to O
tape O
it O
and O
now O
it O
looks O
terrible O
but O
it O
's O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
holds O
the O
piece O
on O
. O
Not O
to O
mention O
the O
metal O
grate O
on O
the O
back O
that O
holds O
the O
filter O
in O
keeps O
caving O
in O
constantly O
. O
I O
feel O
like O
these O
are O
not O
meant O
for O
travel O
, O
which O
is O
funny O
because O
it O
's O
travel O
size O
. O
Maybe O
I O
got O
a O
bad O
batch O
or O
something O
. O
Yes O
it O
's O
a O
powerful O
driver O
, O
but O
this O
seems O
more O
like O
it O
's O
aimed O
at O
a O
consumer O
than O
a O
professional O
which O
is O
sad O
because O
I O
had O
many O
professionals O
reccomend O
it O
to O
me O
. O
I O
would O
n't O
reccomend O
this O
to O
traveling O
stylists O
, O
but O
maybe O
it O
works O
better O
if O
you O
have O
your O
own O
station O
. O

good O
quality O
and O
lasts O
a O
long O
time O
... O

This O
hairdryer O
with O
the O
brush O
attachment O
works O
very O
well O
for O
drying O
and O
straightening O
out O
curly O
hair O
. O
A O
must O
for O
everyone O
with O
these O
extra O
curls O
! O
It O
's O
also O
quite O
nice O
to O
have O
the O
availability O
of O
the O
two O
currents O
that O
one O
might O
use O
built O
into O
this O
one O
unit O
. O
It O
will O
be O
great O
for O
traveling O
to O
Europe O
. O

Can O
a O
blow O
dryer O
be O
too O
powerful O
? O
.. O
the O
answer O
is O
yes O
.. O
it O
is O
very O
well O
made O
but O
it O
is O
so O
powerful O
if O
drys O
my O
hair O
so O
fast O
I O
ca O
n't O
style O
it O
with O
my O
round O
brush O
for O
a O
good O
blow O
out O
.. O
resulting O
in O
frizz O
that O
I O
have O
to O
correct O
with O
a O
flat O
iron O
.. O
this O
was O
on O
low O
setting O
.. O
the O
high O
setting O
might O
as O
well O
be O
a O
jet O
engine O
. O
. O
I O
'm O
keeping O
it O
to O
use O
on O
my O
poodle O
because O
she O
needs O
to O
be O
dryer O
quickly O
.. O
one O
major O
plus O
though O
it O
does O
not O
get O
very O
hot O
thus O
limiting O
the O
damage O
you O
will O
do O
. O

the O
Conair O
it O
replaced O
. O
This O
was O
HUGE O
for O
me O
, O
as O
I O
like O
a O
good O
air O
flow O
. O
It O
takes O
longer O
for O
my O
wife O
to O
dry O
her O
hair O
because O
of O
it O
, O
so O
we O
went O
back O
to O
our O
old O
brand O
. O
It O
does O
, O
however O
, O
leave O
your O
hair O
silkier O
which O
was O
a O
surprise O
to O
me O
. O
I O
did O
n't O
think O
an O
ionic O
dryer O
could O
do O
that O
, O
but O
it O
does O
. O
The O
two O
settings O
it O
has O
for O
wattage O
did O
n't O
seem O
to O
make O
much O
of O
a O
difference O
, O
but O
it O
's O
a O
nice O
touch O
. O
I O
'm O
sure O
there O
's O
a O
reason O
for O
the O
option O
, O
but O
I O
ca O
n't O
think O
of O
anything O
it O
's O
useful O
for O
. O
I O
put O
it O
on O
the O
high O
setting O
and O
let O
it O
go O
. O
The O
retractable O
cord O
is O
nice O
, O
but O
it O
does O
n't O
reel O
the O
cord O
all O
the O
way O
in O
, O
leaving O
about O
16 O
in O
left O
dangling O
. O
After O
a O
few O
weeks O
of O
use O
, O
it O
reels O
in O
even O
less O
, O
now O
leaving O
about O
20 O
or O
so O
inches O
hanging O
. O
Pro O
: O
Silky O
hair O
, O
somewhat O
retractable O
cord O
, O
two O
wattage O
settings O
( O
that O
I O
'll O
prob O
never O
use).Con O
: O
Takes O
longer O
to O
dry O
long O
, O
thick O
hair O
as O
the O
air O
current O
is O
n't O
as O
strong O
as O
I O
'd O
like O
. O
I O
would O
n't O
buy O
this O
again O
or O
recommend O
it O
, O
but O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
mind O
a O
slightly O
weaker O
air O
flow O
, O
the O
ionic O
silkiness O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

Return O
is O
no O
longer O
needed O

It O
only O
has O
high O
and O
low O
modes O
, O
or O
off O
. O
For O
the O
price O
, O
the O
size O
, O
and O
options O
, O
it O
has O
dried O
my O
hair O
faster O
than O
that O
blue O
Conair O
from O
Target O
. O
My O
hair O
is O
dark O
black O
, O
thick O
in O
volume O
, O
and O
takes O
a O
long O
time O
to O
dry O
. O
You O
can O
ask O
all O
of O
my O
hairstylists O
. O
So O
this O
one O
is O
great O
for O
your O
money O
. O

Nice O
velocity O
and O
does O
n't O
get O
too O
hot O
. O
  O
Cold O
button O
a O
good O
feature O
. O

as O
described O

Did O
not O
like O
this O
at O
all O
. O
My O
hair O
took O
longer O
to O
dry O
and O
it O
was O
so O
loud O
! O
! O
! O
Returned O
immediately O

DEFINATELY O
WORTH O
EVERY O
PENNY O

MY O
  O
STYLIST O
OWNS O
THIS O
SAME O
ONE O
AND O
SAID O
THEY O
LAST O
A O
VERY O
VERY O
LONG O
TIME O
. O
LOVE O
IT O
.. O
WOULD O
DEFINATELY O
BUY O
IT O
AGAIN O
IF O
I O
HAD O
TO O
. O

Love O
the O
air O
pressure O
on O
this O
dryer O
! O

I O
would O
have O
given O
this O
blow O
dryer O
a O
5 O
, O
but O
the O
cord O
needs O
to O
be O
longer O
. O
  O
Overall O
it O
works O
great O
though O
. O

This O
dryer O
was O
purchased O
last O
summer O
and O
safely O
stored O
while O
we O
moved O
. O
I O
pulled O
it O
out O
this O
January O
, O
and O
the O
low O
setting O
has O
already O
stopped O
working O
, O
while O
the O
high O
setting O
barely O
pushes O
out O
any O
air O
. O
  O
I O
'm O
now O
convinced O
this O
was O
a O
fake O
, O
and O
am O
sorely O
disappointed O
. O
Amazon O
is O
always O
our O
first O
stop O
for O
purchases O
such O
as O
these O
, O
and O
I O
've O
always O
been O
very O
happy O
with O
their O
customer O
service O
... O
I O
have O
a O
request O
for O
a O
refund O
in O
, O
and O
we O
'll O
see O
how O
this O
resolves O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
hair O
dryer O
because O
it O
was O
dual O
voltage O
, O
and O
I O
wished O
to O
use O
it O
in O
both O
the O
United O
Kingdom O
and O
France O
. O
  O
It O
has O
an O
American O
plug O
, O
but O
with O
a O
convertor O
for O
each O
country O
it O
worked O
wonderfully O
! O
  O
I O
could O
not O
be O
happier O
with O
this O
purchase O
. O
  O
Turns O
out O
we O
went O
to O
Italy O
too O
, O
and O
with O
the O
same O
French O
convertor O
, O
the O
dryer O
worked O
in O
Italy O
too O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
product O
- O
compact O
and O
powerful O
- O
worth O
for O
money O

works O
well O
. O
Shipping O
was O
spot O
on O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
receive O
the O
straightening O
pic O
that O
came O
with O
the O
dryer O
. O

love O
it O
love O
the O
arrival O
time O
as O
well O
. O

Very O
short O
cord O
, O
was O
expecting O
much O
longer O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
from O
Target O
a O
little O
over O
three O
months O
ago O
( O
so O
, O
sadly O
I O
ca O
n't O
return O
it O
) O
and O
the O
heating O
element O
has O
already O
died O
. O
I O
like O
the O
folding O
and O
retractable O
cord O
features O
as O
well O
as O
the O
reasonable O
price O
, O
but O
it O
is O
n't O
a O
deal O
if O
you O
have O
to O
replace O
it O
every O
three O
months O
! O
I O
'll O
spend O
a O
little O
more O
next O
time O
and O
get O
a O
higher O
quality O
product O
. O

been O
using O
this O
brand O
in O
my O
bathrooms O
for O
years O
. O
  O
easy O
to O
install O
. O

It O
works O
great O
. O

Curly O
girls O
, O
you O
're O
hair O
will O
love O
this O
. O
Gives O
my O
curls O
volume O
without O
frizz O
. O
My O
hair O
dries O
quicker O
this O
this O
dryer O
, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
super O
hot O
. O
The O
shape O
of O
it O
allows O
you O
to O
shape O
your O
air O
while O
you O
dry O
it O
. O
If O
you O
have O
curly O
hair O
, O
get O
this O
now O
! O
I O
do O
wish O
it O
had O
some O
sort O
of O
attachment O
that O
was O
similar O
to O
a O
concentrator O
so O
I O
could O
blow O
dry O
parts O
of O
my O
hair O
out O
. O
You O
can O
take O
off O
the O
diffuser O
attachment O
but O
it O
's O
not O
hot O
enough O
or O
concentrated O
enough O
to O
make O
my O
hair O
do O
what O
I O
want O
for O
that O
type O
of O
style O
. O
I O
have O
to O
use O
a O
traditional O
dryer O
if O
I O
am O
doing O
something O
other O
than O
just O
being O
curly O
. O

Bought O
this O
for O
limited O
use O
to O
seal O
windows O
, O
having O
never O
purchased O
one O
before O
. O
It O
worked O
great O
. O

Premium O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
Does O
what O
the O
discription O
said O
it O
would O
. O
  O
Light O
, O
good O
looking O
and O
not O
cumbersome O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
item O
my O
college O
age O
daughter O
loves O
it O

Awesome O

This O
is O
not O
the O
titanium O
nano O
portifino O
. O
If O
it O
is O
then O
it O
was O
either O
used O
or O
refurbished O
and O
not O
returned O
to O
is O
original O
state O
. O
It O
overheats O
and O
has O
damaged O
my O
hair O
because O
it O
is O
not O
working O
correctly O
. O
I O
know O
this O
because O
I O
also O
own O
the O
true O
black O
titanium O
nano O
portifino O
and O
it O
's O
an O
incredible O
hair O
dryer O
and O
my O
fiance O
is O
a O
stylist O
. O
Disappointed O

Arrived O
before O
promised O
. O
  O
So O
far O
I O
am O
happy O
with O
the O
product O
. O

Great O
just O
not O
happy O
how O
it O
cools O
down O
when O
I O
have O
it O
on O
for O
5 O
minutes O
. O

It O
works O
great O
! O
The O
dial O
for O
timing O
it O
's O
backwards O
but O
it O
works O
just O
fine O
. O

I O
used O
to O
spend O
six O
hours O
doing O
my O
girls O
' O
naturally O
coily O
and O
kinky O
hair O
. O
Drying O
time O
has O
now O
been O
cut O
to O
an O
average O
if O
five O
minutes O
, O
which O
in O
turns O
means O
a O
styling O
time O
of O
two O
hours O
total O
on O
the O
girls O
. O
This O
dryer O
gave O
me O
my O
weekends O
back O
. O
Only O
down O
side O
is O
that O
the O
ones O
I O
've O
had O
go O
out O
after O
roughly O
two O
years O
. O
I O
'm O
on O
my O
third O
t3 O
since O
2011 O
. O

I O
have O
very O
fine O
hair O
and O
it O
is O
not O
thick O
, O
so O
when O
I O
go O
outside O
on O
a O
humid O
day O
, O
the O
places O
where O
my O
hair O
is O
naturally O
curly O
curl O
up O
worse O
and O
the O
rest O
loses O
the O
style O
I O
intended O
when O
I O
left O
the O
house O
. O
Static O
was O
a O
big O
issue O
, O
so O
when O
shopping O
for O
a O
blower O
with O
high O
wattage O
, O
high O
heat O
( O
yes O
, O
I O
want O
HOT O
) O
and O
high O
velocity O
, O
I O
found O
this O
one O
hoping O
it O
would O
meet O
the O
requirements O
. O
I O
found O
it O
to O
be O
like O
most O
of O
the O
drug O
- O
store O
blowers O
in O
my O
blower O
- O
graveyard O
in O
the O
closet O
, O
going O
to O
the O
next O
garage O
sale O
. O
I O
just O
did O
not O
meet O
the O
expectations O
, O
not O
enough O
blow O
, O
heat O
and O
I O
still O
had O
frizzy O
static O
hair O
. O
It O
works O
and O
probably O
works O
just O
fine O
for O
those O
who O
have O
thick O
hair O
they O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
damage O
, O
but O
my O
hair O
takes O
2 O
minutes O
flat O
to O
dry O
and O
style O
. O
I O
did O
move O
on O
and O
purchased O
Onei O
MK O
- O
II O
for O
about O
$ O
70 O
taking O
a O
really O
big O
chance O
. O
It O
blew O
me O
away O
literally O
and O
exceeded O
all O
expectations O
. O
So O
for O
fine O
hair O
users O
, O
it O
may O
be O
worthwhile O
to O
shop O
around O
since O
there O
are O
very O
few O
resources O
for O
our O
types O
. O

Best O
hair O
dryer O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
. O

Startlingly O
small O
and O
flimsy O
looking O
, O
with O
a O
thin O
plastic O
grill O
over O
the O
fan O
. O
But O
does O
a O
decent O
job O
, O
with O
good O
air O
on O
the O
high O
setting O
. O
I O
'd O
never O
rely O
on O
this O
for O
every O
day O
or O
for O
a O
long O
trip O
, O
but O
since O
it O
's O
so O
light O
and O
small O
, O
will O
keep O
it O
on O
hand O
for O
overnights O
. O

Works O
great O
! O

his O
dryer O
replaces O
my O
old O
one O
which O
is O
cumbersome O
and O
bulkier O
. O
  O
Does O
a O
great O
job O
. O

very O
compact O
. O
Ideal O
for O

not O
the O
red O
one O
I O
wanted O
, O
but O
is O
sufficient O
. O

I O
bought O
this O

for O
my O
mother O
. O

cheap O
. O
  O
Cheap O
, O
lightweight O
, O
plasticky O
feeling O
. O
  O
Granted O
, O
it O
IS O
all O
of O
those O
things O
but O
I O
have O
a O
much O
nicer O
travel O
hair O
dryer O
that O
does O
n't O
feel O
like O
it O
is O
just O
going O
to O
snap O
in O
two O
... O
unfortunately O
my O
other O
one O
does O
n't O
have O
a O
diffuser O
which O
is O
the O
sole O
reason O
I O
got O
this O
one O
. O
  O
But O
hey O
, O
it O
's O
only O
for O
travel O
... O

Cheap O
blower O
dryer O
. O
It O
does O
n't O
blow O
dry O
very O
hot O
air O
but O
I O
did O
buy O
it O
for O
a O
good O
price O
and O
it O
works O
. O
This O
is O
why O
I O
gave O
it O
3 O
stars O
. O

Small O
enough O
to O
travel O
but O
powerful O
, O
I O
like O
it O
better O
than O
my O
regular O
Revlon O
I O
was O
using O
for O
3 O
years O
. O

I O
just O
hate O
it O
! O
I O
gave O
away O
my O
Babyliss O
thinking O
this O
one O
is O
better O
. O
What O
a O
mistake O
! O
! O
! O
When O
I O
use O
it O
my O
hair O
gets O
opaque O
. O
I O
'm O
very O
disappointment O
and O
is O
too O
late O
to O
return O
it O
. O

VERY O
HEAVY O
- O
seems O
to O
work O
well O
but O
would O
n't O
recommend O
for O
travel O
. O

Worked O
great O
in O
Germany O
and O
the O
UK O
. O
  O
Just O
turn O
the O
butyon O
and O
you O
are O
ready O
for O
overseas O
. O
  O
Lightweight O
. O
  O
Low O
setying O
is O
powerful O
. O
  O
Highly O
recommend O
. O

Wife O
loves O
it O
! O

As O
of O
now O
no O
complaints O
, O
It O
's O
quiet O
and O
does O
the O
job O
. O

Was O
looking O
for O
a O
family O
hair O
dryer O
. O
Got O
a O
great O
deal O
and O
works O
good O
. O
  O
We O
also O
like O
the O
color O
. O

The O
weight O
is O
inordinately O
heavy O
! O
Why O
? O
My O
old O
dryer O
weight O
was O
like O
nothing O
in O
comparison O
. O
It O
does O
the O
job O
, O
but O
I O
'd O
recommend O
a O
lighter O
model O
to O
a O
friend O
. O

The O
real O
product O
is O
bigger O
than O
I O
expected O
but O
it O
does O
make O
your O
hair O
look O
better O
comparing O
with O
other O
regular O
dryers O
. O
And O
I O
love O
the O
color O
! O
! O
! O

My O
mom O
is O
a O
cosmetologist O
& O
has O
always O
supplied O
me O
with O
professional O
grade O
dryers O
for O
my O
thick O
, O
heavy O
hair O
. O
This O
one O
works O
better O
than O
any O
other O
professional O
dryer O
I O
have O
tried O
. O
The O
cost O
was O
more O
reasonable O
too O
. O

The O
hair O
dryer O
works O
as O
expected O
. O

With O
three O
teenage O
girls O
in O
the O
house O
, O
the O
hair O
dryer O
gets O
a O
lot O
of O
use O
. O
A O
LOT O
OF O
USE O
. O
We O
've O
blown O
through O
quite O
a O
few O
hairdryers O
- O
no O
pun O
intended O
. O
This O
one O
however O
, O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
clear O
winner O
. O
As O
a O
stylishly O
bald O
man O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
personally O
vouch O
for O
it O
, O
but O
the O
female O
testimonials O
are O
unanimous O
... O
this O
is O
an O
excellent O
product O
. O
Full O
disclosure O
: O
the O
dog O
is O
n't O
a O
big O
fan O
, O
but O
she O
does O
n't O
like O
baths O
much O
either O
, O
so O
can'r O
be O
surprised O
. O

Great O
little O
hair O
dryer O
for O
the O
money O
. O
No O
cool O
setting O
and O
low O
speed O
is O
really O
low O
, O
but O
I O
still O
like O
it O
and O
would O
recommend O
it O
. O

Love O
, O
love O
, O
love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
! O
  O
I O
've O
been O
looking O
( O
and O
trying O
) O
for O
months O
now O
! O
I O
finally O
found O
the O
perfect O
one O
for O
me O
! O
  O
YEAH O
! O
It O
's O
lightweight O
, O
small O
enough O
to O
travel O
and O
powerful O
. O
So O
easy O
to O
use O
. O
Economical O
, O
too O
! O
  O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
buy O
another O
one O
for O
the O
guest O
bath O
! O
  O
It O
's O
hard O
to O
locate O
great O
hair O
dryers O
when O
you O
find O
one O
that O
you O
like O
in O
a O
hotel O
. O
For O
some O
reason O
Conair O
puts O
1875 O
on O
most O
ALL O
their O
dryers O
, O
so O
it O
's O
hard O
to O
tell O
the O
actual O
model O
number O
when O
you O
find O
one O
that O
you O
like O
... O
  O
Glad O
we O
were O
finally O
able O
to O
track O
this O
one O
down O
! O

I O
bought O
this O
hairdryer O
more O
than O
year O
ago O
when O
my O
last O
one O
lit O
on O
fire O
. O
I O
choose O
this O
one O
because O
I O
know O
the O
Babyliss O
name O
and O
I O
loved O
the O
pattern O
. O
The O
pattern O
IS O
actually O
as O
cute O
as O
it O
looks O
in O
the O
picture O
. O
Weight O
: O
This O
dryer O
weighs O
about O
as O
much O
as O
a O
weighted O
tape O
dispenser O
. O
It O
feels O
like O
a O
professional O
hair O
dryer O
and O
is O
not O
easy O
to O
break O
. O
Design O
: O
The O
cord O
on O
the O
dryer O
is O
somewhat O
rigid O
and O
unwieldy O
. O
It O
became O
easier O
to O
wrangle O
when O
I O
bought O
Velcro O
ties O
for O
the O
cord O

: O
I O
ca O
n't O
say O
much O
here O
. O
After O
all O
, O
it O
is O
just O
blowing O
hot O
air O
, O
but O
I O
guess O
that O
I O
can O
say O
that O
it O
dries O
quickly O
. O
Temperature O
: O
The O
hot O
setting O
gets O
pretty O
hot O
. O
Not O
hot O
enough O
to O
burn O
your O
scalp O
, O
but O
hot O
enough O
to O
get O
the O
job O
done O
. O

I O
love O
this O
dryer O
. O
I O
use O
it O
as O
both O
my O
everyday O
dryer O
and O
my O
travel O
dryer O
. O
It O
's O
just O
as O
powerful O
as O
a O
full O
- O
size O
but O
without O
the O
weight O
and O
bulk O
. O
I O
'm O
seriously O
never O
going O
back O
to O
a O
full O
- O
size O
dryer O
again O
. O

dryers O
my O
hair O
super O
fast O
and O
no O
frizz O

Just O
love O
it O
, O
freedom O
from O
the O
hooded O
dryer O
! O

Works O
okay O
, O
but O
very O
heavy O
! O

Good O
air O
flow O
. O
Fairly O
quiet O
. O
Seems O
like O
good O
construction O
. O
Location O
of O
the O
buttons O
makes O
them O
easy O
to O
switch O
unintentionally O
. O
I O
think O
this O
is O
a O
winner O
at O
around O
twenty O
six O
bucks O
delivered O
. O

great O
design O
base O
could O
be O
more O
sturdy O

Great O
dryer O
makes O
my O
hair O
feel O
like O
silk O

Has O
a O
good O
volume O
of O
air O
on O
high O
for O
a O
compact O
unit O
, O
but O
the O
trade O
- O
off O
is O
it O
is O
a O
bit O
noisy O
too O
. O
  O
Not O
mention O
in O
the O
listing O
, O
but O
the O
blue O
button O
is O
a O
cool O
air O
button O
and O
works O
as O
would O
be O
expected O
. O
  O
Unlike O
the O
Revlon O
Rvdr5033 O
I O
had O
the O
cool O
button O
on O
this O
unit O
just O
turns O
the O
heat O
off O
and O
back O
on O
when O
released O
and O
does O
not O
change O
the O
fan O
. O
  O
It O
gets O
very O
hot O
on O
high O
and O
so O
did O
the O
Revlon O
. O
  O
Too O
hot O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
but O
it O
appears O
no O
one O
makes O
a O
1500 O
watt O
model O
anymore O
. O
  O
I O
could O
find O
nothing O
but O
1875 O
watt O
models O
even O
in O
compact O
. O
  O
Not O
pictured O
or O
mentioned O
but O
this O
one O
like O
all O
of O
them O
has O
the O
huge O
block O
on O
the O
cord O
end O
with O
a O
GFI O
and O
AC O
plug O
as O
part O
of O
that O
block O
. O
  O
Even O
though O
they O
tell O
you O
not O
to O
put O
two O
GFI O
's O
on O
the O
same O
circuit O
and O
there O
has O
n't O
been O
a O
house O
built O
in O
almost O
40 O
years O
without O
a O
GFI O
covering O
any O
outlet O
in O
every O
bathroom O
the O
requirement O
for O
this O
still O
persists O
. O
  O
I O
like O
that O
you O
can O
easily O
take O
the O
cover O
of O
the O
fan O
in O
the O
rear O
for O
cleaning O
. O
  O
Not O
many O
of O
the O
compact O
models O
seem O
to O
have O
that O
feature O
. O
  O
Overall O
a O
good O
unit O
. O
  O
Time O
will O
tell O
how O
durable O
and O
long O
lasting O
it O
is O
. O
  O
I O
can O
only O
hope O
it O
is O
as O
good O
in O
that O
area O
as O
the O
one O
it O
replaced O
. O
  O
Update O
7/21/15 O
: O
Well O
it O
is O
NOT O
very O
long O
lasting O
. O
  O
About O
4 O
months O
in O
it O
suddenly O
started O
smoking O
and O
got O
very O
hot O
very O
fast O
did O
some O
nice O
sparking O
and O
arcing O
, O
then O
quit O
. O
  O
We O
will O
see O
if O
they O
honor O
the O
warranty O
. O

Great O
size O
and O
does O
a O
good O
job O
. O
The O
detachable O
black O
diffuser O
piece O
is O
extremely O
hard O
to O
get O
off O
( O
at O
least O
mine O
was O
) O
so O
consider O
whether O
you O
will O
take O
it O
off O
and O
on O
often O
. O

I O
will O
now O
be O
saving O
money O
by O
going O
less O
to O
my O
hairstylist O
. O
This O
blowdryer O
dried O
my O
hair O
2x O
faster O
than O
a O
previous O
blowdryer O
I O
had O
. O
  O
I O
wished O
I O
had O
bought O
this O
blowdryer O
years O
ago O
! O

Best O
hair O
dryer O
I O
've O
ever O
owned O
. O
  O
I O
'm O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
product O
. O

it O
did O
n't O
fit O
me O
, O
I O
WAS O
NOT O
TALL O
  O
TO O
FIT O
UNDER O
IT O
SO O
I O
HAD O
TO O
SIT O
ON O
A O
BIG O
CHAIR O
COUTON O
  O
TO O
FIT O
MY O
HEAD O
UNDER O
IT O
. O
  O
I O
HAD O
ONE O
BEFOR O
THAT O
THE O
NECK O
PART O
WENT O
UP O
OR O
DOWN O
AND O
I O
though O
this O
one O
did O
it O
too O
. O

I O
've O
been O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
deal O
on O
a O
hair O
dryer O
for O
weeks O
and O
finally O
came O
across O
this O
one O
. O
Great O
purchase O
. O

gave O
3 O
stars O
because O
it O
is O
advertised O
as O
having O
2 O
speeds O
and O
3 O
heat O
settings O
. O
It O
does O
but O
the O
heat O
settings O
are O
fixed O
to O
certain O
speeds O
. O
You O
can O
not O
have O
high O
speed O
with O
low O
heat O
or O
low O
speed O
with O
high O
heat O
, O
only O
high O
heat O
with O
high O
speed O
or O
low O
heat O
with O
low O
speed O
etc O
. O
Wanted O
to O
control O
heat O
and O
speed O
separately O
. O
Nothing O
wrong O
with O
unit O
otherwise O
but O
lowered O
rating O
due O
to O
not O
being O
able O
to O
change O
heat O
and O
speed O
settings O
independently O
. O
Returned O
for O
refund O
. O

Fantastic O
Hair O
Dryer O

Love O
it O
! O
! O
! O

It O
is O
adequate O
. O
I O
do O
wish O
the O
prongs O
of O
the O
diffuser O
were O
a O
more O
flexible O
or O
softer O
. O
It O
kind O
of O
hurts O
our O
heads O
. O

this O
is O
a O
great O
little O
hairdryer O
- O
I O
ordered O
it O
for O
travel O
. O
  O
It O
's O
a O
little O
heavy O
and O
large O
for O
a O
travel O
dryer O
but O
most O
travel O
dryers O
are O
loud O
and O
cheap O
and O
take O
forever O
to O
dry O
your O
hair O
. O
  O
This O
one O

The O
brush O
attachment O
does O
n't O
work O
well O
through O
the O
hair O

I O
was O
actually O
looking O
for O
something O
else O
when O
I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
and O
thought O
why O
not O
. O
  O
I O
am O
very O
pleased O
with O
this O
purchase O
. O
  O
I O
have O
fine O
shoulder O
length O
hair O
and O
it O
did O
not O
take O
an O
hour O
to O
dry O
, O
as O
another O
reviewer O
stated O
. O
  O
( O
Of O
course O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
attempt O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
when O
it O
is O
dripping O
wet O
either O
. O
  O
I O
wrap O
my O
hair O
in O
a O
towel O
and O
do O
other O
things O
for O
a O
while O
before O
attempting O
to O
blow O
dry O
. O
) O
  O
Anyway O
, O
I O
was O
worried O
at O
first O
because O
the O
packaging O
and O
most O
of O
the O
instructions O
are O
in O
Japanese O
. O
  O
But O
I O
used O
it O
on O
the O
lower O
voltage O
and O
it O
was O
fine O
. O
  O
I O
used O
the O
regular O
brush O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
, O
as O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
how O
to O
use O
the O
round O
brush O
yet O
. O
  O
I O
dried O
most O
of O
my O
hair O
and O
then O
used O
this O
upside O
down O
to O
give O
my O
hair O
some O
lift O
and O
bounce O
, O
which O
it O
did O
. O
  O
Also O
, O
my O
hair O
does O
not O
look O
frizzy O
, O
like O
it O
does O
at O
times O
when O
using O
a O
regular O
blow O
dryer O
( O
I O
believe O
because O
sometimes O
a O
regular O
blow O
dryer O
both O
damages O
and O
tends O
to O
tangle O
your O
hair O
) O
. O
  O
My O
hair O
actually O
looks O
shiny O
as O
well O
as O
smooth O
( O
as O
if O
I O
flat O
ironed O
it O
) O
. O
  O
I O
would O
give O
this O
a O
try O
if O
you O
are O
someone O
who O
likes O
the O
look O
of O
their O
hair O
when O
it O
is O
blow O
dried O
and/or O
flat O
ironed O
but O
with O
what O
seems O
much O
less O
damage O
. O
  O
I O
think O
you O
could O
get O
away O
with O
using O
just O
this O
dryer O
and O
a O
little O
serum O
( O
depending O
on O
how O
naturally O
straight O
your O
hair O
is O
) O
. O
I O
am O
excited O
to O
use O
this O
and O
try O
to O
figure O
out O
the O
round O
brush O
too O
. O

Works O
very O
well O
thus O
far O
. O

I O
am O
small O
with O
shoulder O
problems O
and O
this O
is O
very O
compact O
and O
light O
weight O
. O
  O
It O
packs O
a O
punch O
with O
power O
! O

excellent O
item O

Since O
my O
hair O
is O
too O
thin O
, O
it O
dries O
it O
in O
a O
minute O
! O
But O
leaves O
it O
so O
hard O
frizzy O
:( O
it O
is O
also O
very O
, O
very O
loud O
! O
! O
! O
My O
duaghter O
loves O
it O
, O
her O
hair O
is O
long O
and O
thick O
, O
she O
does O
not O
complain O
. O
I O
did O
mot O
return O
it O
, O
my O
daughter O
uses O
it O
. O

Does O
what O
its O
suppose O
to O
do O
, O
like O
the O
ability O
to O
clean O
it O
. O

Very O
good O

Love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
Dries O
my O
hair O
in O
no O
time O

The O
Nano O
technology O
is O
great O
. O
Blow O
dry O
is O
much O
faster O
than O
regular O
product O
. O
Keep O
my O
hair O
style O
nice O
( O
no O
dryness O
) O
. O

I O
'm O
  O
in O
love O
with O
this O
hair O
dryer O
It O
's O
small O
but O
really O
dry O
's O
my O
hair O
fast O
and O
does O
a O
wonderful O
job O
. O

it O
took O
me O
a O
while O
to O
find O
a O
blow O
dryer O
that O
actually O
made O
it O
easier O
to O
do O
my O
hair O
, O
usually O
my O
hair O
would O
still O
be O
super O
fluffy O
and O
still O
kind O
of O
tangled O
after O
blow O
drying O
. O
I O
have O
really O
kinky O
curls O
and O
after O
using O
this O
my O
hair O
was O
almost O
straight O
. O
I O
only O
used O
a O
flat O
iron O
so O
it O
would O
be O
sleek O
but O
this O
blow O
dryer O
really O
works O
. O
it O
made O
my O
hair O
shiny O
and O
straight O
and O
it O
gets O
really O
hot O
which O
helps O
a O
great O
deal O
. O
I O
totally O
recommend O
this O
blow O
dryer O
to O
anyone O
especially O
if O
you O
have O
kinky O
curly O
hair O
like O
my O
self O
. O

I O
had O
one O
before O
and O
I O
love O
it O
. O
  O
It O
's O
off O
the O
counter O
and O
out O
of O
the O
way O
. O

Works O
great O
; O
looks O
good O
on O
wall O
. O

Dries O
really O
fast O
. O
I O
have O
to O
use O
a O
brush O
and O
brush O
my O
hair O
while O
using O
this O
dryer O
or O
else O
it O
is O
just O
an O
odd O
mess O
. O
I O
live O
in O
area O
with O
high O
humidity O
off O
the O
Gulf O
coast O
and O
my O
hair O
stays O
flat O
all O
day O
! O
Even O
straighter O
than O
my O
straight O
haired O
friends O
. O
I O
do O
have O
to O
use O
another O
dryer O
when O
I O
want O
to O
wear O
my O
curls O
because O
this O
dryer O
takes O
them O
out O
. O

Works O
great O
. O

i O
love O
the O
cord O
keeper O
Conair O
dryers O
. O
  O
Much O
easier O
to O
store O
. O
  O
My O
old O
Conair O
cord O
keeper O
( O
less O
expensive O
, O
2 O
speed O
, O
2 O
heat O
settings O
) O
wore O
out O
at O
the O
plug O
. O
  O
Could O
n't O
be O
without O
a O
blow O
dryer O
so O
looked O
to O
trusty O
Amazon O
. O
  O
I O
saw O
this O
model O
and O
read O
the O
reviews O
. O
  O
I O
liked O
that O
it O
had O
a O
cool O
setting O
and O
did O
n't O
have O
to O
keep O
, O
the O
button O
pushed O
for O
the O
cool O
shot O
. O
  O
I O
also O
like O
that O
it O
has O
the O
cord O
keeper O
. O
  O
But O
the O
best O
feature O
about O
it O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
is O
that O
it O
is O
MUCH O
QUIETER O
than O
the O
less O
expensive O
model O
. O
  O
I O
get O
ready O
for O
work O
in O
the O
early O
mornings O
and O
this O
model O
produces O
a O
moderate O
hum O
, O
compared O
to O
the O
blasting O
roar O
the O
cheaper O
model O
makes O
. O
  O
If O
a O
quieter O
blow O
dryer O
is O
what O
you O
're O
looking O
for O
, O
with O
1875 O
power O
, O
this O
is O
your O
dryer O
. O
  O
Worth O
the O
extra O
money O
! O
! O
! O
  O
Buy O
it O
, O
you O
wo O
n't O
be O
sorry O
! O
  O
Super O
fast O
delivery O
! O
  O
Ps O
, O
use O
the O
concentrator O
nozzle O
, O
cuts O
down O
on O
frizz O
. O

Exceeded O
my O
expectations O
. O

This O
hair O
dryer O
met O
all O
of O
my O
expectations O
. O
I O
love O
its O
compact O
design O
. O
The O
bonnet O
is O
large O
enough O
to O
fit O
over O
rollers O
, O
and O
on O
the O
medium O
heat O
setting O
it O
gets O
warm O
enough O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
in O
10 O
minutes O
. O
I O
think O
it O
's O
a O
quality O
product O
with O
a O
thoughtful O
design O
. O

Works O
great O
! O
Night O
light O
still O
works O
and O
we O
've O
had O
it O
over O
a O
year O
! O

I O
have O
long O
curly O
hair O
3b O
. O
I O
bought O
this O
dyer O
thinking O
it O
would O
work O
wonders O
on O
my O
hair O
. O
First O
, O
I O
think O
it O
does O
a O
great O
job O
and O
dries O
my O
hair O
very O
fast O
. O
However O
, O
I O
would O
prefer O
to O
have O
the O
teeth O
longer O
and O
better O
way O
to O
cup O
the O
hair O
so O
to O
speak O
. O
My O
hair O
gets O
caught O
in O
the O
back O
and O
ends O
up O
with O
tge O
burning O
hair O
smell O
. O
Secondly O
, O
I O
bought O
this O
dyer O
6 O
weeks O
ago O
and O
it O
's O
already O
broken O
. O
Amazon O
is O
amazing O
and O
agreed O
to O
refund O
my O
money O
. O
I O
think O
this O
would O
work O
better O
for O
women O
with O
short O
curly O
hair O
more O
than O
anything O
. O

Love O
it O
. O
It O
fits O
on O
the O
wall O
and O
it O
's O
out O
of O
the O
way O
. O
Nite O
lite O
is O
bright O
also O

Bought O
one O
of O
these O
for O
a O
spare O
bedroom O
when O
we O
have O
guests O
. O
Took O
a O
shower O
in O
there O
one O
day O
and O
LOVED O
this O
so O
much O
I O
threw O
mine O
away O
and O
bought O
one O
for O
myself O
too O
. O

Operates O
like O
a O
very O
cheap O
hairdryer O
. O
We O
bought O
for O
our O
10yr O
old O
daughter O
and O
it O
's O
fine O
for O
her O
. O
Takes O
longer O
to O
dry O
hair O
than O
most O
. O
We O
may O
just O
have O
a O
fluke O
... O

The O
vulcano O
of O
hair O
dryers O

EXCELENTE O
PRODUCTO O

Works O
well O
but O
extremely O
loud O
. O

so O
far O
so O
good O
. O
  O
My O
husband O
ordered O
it O
, O
but O
we O
both O
use O
it O
. O
  O
Have O
had O
a O
similar O
  O
one O
before O
and O
used O
it O
for O
years O
. O
Hoping O
this O
one O
last O
as O
long O
. O

This O
blow O
dryer O
was O
heavy O
and O
too O
hot O
. O
  O
At O
the O
time O
of O
purchase O
this O
product O
there O
were O
plenty O
in O
stock O
. O
As O
soon O
as O
I O
got O
mine O
delivered O
. O
The O
product O
page O
shows O
this O
product O
is O
no O
longer O
available O
. O
Anyway O
, O
I O
returned O
it O
and O
got O
the O
Babyliss O
one O
. O
Much O
happier O
with O
the O
other O
purchase O
. O

I O
hope O
it O
last O
long O
than O
the O
one O
I O
got O
last O
year O

This O
is O
much O
lighter O
than O
the O
older O
model O
I O
had O
and O
love O
the O
different O
speeds O
and O
power O
. O

Great O
! O

Light O
is O
too O
bright O

Broke O
within O
2 O
months O
. O
  O
I O
would O
recommend O
buying O
a O
few O
levels O
up O
as O
I O
have O
had O
those O
in O
the O
past O
and O
they O
do O
not O
break O
. O

I O
love O
this O
dryer O

Cheap O
and O
enough O
for O
normal O
use O
. O

Good O
Product O

I O
love O
the O
smaller O
size O
of O
this O
hair O
dryer O
, O
which O
makes O
it O
great O
for O
travel O
. O
At O
1875w O
, O
it O
's O
also O
still O
powerful O
enough O
to O
dry O
my O
medium O
- O
length O
, O
thick O
hair O
. O
( O
If O
you O
have O
thinner O
or O
shorter O
hair O
, O
it O
might O
be O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
dry O
your O
hair O
on O
the O
lower O
setting O
. O
) O
I O
also O
really O
like O
that O
this O
comes O
with O
two O
different O
diffusers O
, O
making O
it O
easier O
to O
achieve O
the O
style O
I O
want O
when O
drying O
my O
hair O
. O
This O
product O
was O
provided O
for O
testing O
purposes O
, O
but O
all O
opinions O
are O
my O
own O
. O

Chose O
this O
particular O
hair O
dryer O
after O
comparing O
the O
features O
with O
other O
similar O

I O
am O
so O
glad O
that O
I O
went O
with O

it O
is O
the O
best O
hair O
dryer O
I O
have O

Ever O
! O
! O
I O
am O
not O
even O
talking O
about O
the O
fact O
that O
drying O
my O
hair O
time O
is O
cut O
in O
half O
, O
but O
what O
is O
really O
amazing O
that O
my O
hair O
looks O
so O
much O
better O
. O
It O
suddenly O
has O
some O
shine O
, O
including O
the O
ends O
that O
use O
to O
look O
very O
frizzy O
. O
And O
that O
is O
not O
all O
. O
I O
use O
round O
brush O
  O
while O
drying O
my O
hair O
and O
now O
that O
is O
enough O
to O
lift O
the O
roots O
of O
my O
hair O
! O
. O
I O
use O
to O
use O
a O
product O
that O
suppose O
to O
help O
lift O
the O
roots O
and O
I O
hated O
because O
that O
product O
was O
smelly O
and O
It O
really O
was O
n't O
doing O
much O
, O
but O
now O
this O
amazing O
hair O
dryer O
makes O
my O
hair O
look O
healthy O
and O
even O
fuller O
because O
of O
the O
lift O
. O

LOVE O
IT O

. O

As O
always O
, O
the O
Oster O
Wall O
Hair O
Dryer O
is O
convenient O
and O
I O
am O
satisfied O
. O
Although O
, O
my O
previous O
ones O
from O
many O
years O
ago O
were O
somewhat O
smaller O
. O

This O
blow O
dryer O
is O
great O
. O
I O
use O
it O
all O
the O
time O
. O
  O
Mainly O
on O
extensions O
. O
  O
Have O
not O
tried O
it O
on O
natural O
hair O
( O
4a-4c O
) O
yet O
. O
  O
It O
should O
be O
fine O
. O
  O
Makes O
drying O
my O
hair O
so O
much O
faster O
and O
easier O

just O
what O
I O
wonted O

move O

True O
Story O
.... O
I O
have O
spent O
approximately O
$ O
500-$700 O
on O
different O
hair O
and O
blow O
dryers O
. O
I O
have O
all O
from O
the O
cheap O
ones O
to O
the O
expensive O
ones O
and O
this O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
damn O
blow O
/ O
hair O
dryer O
I O
've O
owned O
. O
I O
am O
a O
black O
woman O
with O
natural O
4c O
hair O
that O
means O
thick O
and O
coarse O
and O
typically O
when O
blow O
drying O
my O
hair O
it O
feels O
crunchy O
but O
this O
dryer O
did O
not O
make O
my O
hair O
feel O
like O
that O
. O
Of O
course O
I O
used O
the O
LOC O
method O
with O
Alikay O
Naturals O
products O
before O
blow O
drying O
my O
hair O
and O
it O
turned O
out O
straight O
like O
I O
needed O
it O
to O
be O
. O
I O
'm O
super O
happy O
and O
satisfied O
. O
Also O
I O
used O
the O
hair O
pick O
yo O
blow O
dry O
my O
hair O
and O
it O
did O
not O
pop O
off O
nor O
did O
I O
break O
the O
teeth O
in O
the O
pick O
. O
Dynamite O
! O
  O
If O
it O
pick O
does O
pop O
off O
just O
use O
heat O
resistant O
double O
side O
tape O
to O
keep O
it O
on O
. O

Excellent O
and O
efficient O
. O

I O
should O
have O
read O
through O
more O
of O
the O
reviews O
. O
  O
This O
is O
definitely O
NOT O
the O
hair O
dryer O
you O
want O
if O
you O
have O
arthritis O
. O
:-( O
  O
My O
husband O
has O
no O
issues O
and O
even O
he O
thinks O
it O
's O
too O
heavy O
. O
  O
It O
blows O
great O
. O
  O
No O
complaints O
there O
. O
  O
Just O
absolutely O
not O
the O
hair O
dryer O
for O
you O
if O
you O
have O
small O
hands O
or O
arthritis O
. O

Really O
good O
product O
. O

It O
is O
good O
. O

was O
n't O
what O
I O
expected O
. O
  O
Thought O
it O
would O
have O
been O
more O
powerful O
. O

This O
is O
a O
really O
neat O
, O
compact O
hair O
dryer O
. O
It O
dried O
my O
shoulder O
length O
hair O
pretty O
quickly O
. O
  O
I O
did O
not O
use O
the O
concentrator O
nozzle O
for O
getting O
my O
hair O
dry O
, O
but O
I O
did O
use O
the O
thin O
nozzle O
with O
a O
round O
brush O
for O
styling O
purposes O
. O
  O
I O
really O
liked O
that O
this O
hair O
dryer O
has O
3 O
speed O
settings O
, O
2 O
heat O
settings O
, O
and O
a O
cool O
shot O
function O
. O
  O
I O
used O
all O
3 O
of O
these O
. O
  O
The O
cool O
shot O
function O
is O
probably O
my O
favorite O
, O
it O
really O
sets O
your O
style O
in O
place O
. O
  O
The O
hair O
dryer O
is O
pretty O
light O
and O
the O
handle O
is O
ergonomically O
designed O
to O
feel O
good O
in O
your O
hand O
, O
and O
it O
does O
. O
  O
I O
do O
have O
to O
mention O
that O
the O
first O
time O
I O
used O
it O
, O
there O
was O
a O
distinct O
burning O
smell O
, O
I O
was O
a O
little O
concerned O
about O
it O
, O
but O
after O
about O
a O
minute O
or O
so O
into O
use O
, O
it O
stopped O
and O
I O
have O
n't O
noticed O
it O
again O
since O
. O
  O
Also O
, O
the O
cord O
on O
this O
hair O
dryer O
is O
THICK O
, O
as O
in O
it O
is O
not O
going O
to O
twist O
and O
kink O
up O
, O
it O
is O
a O
quality O
cord O
that O
it O
going O
to O
last O
a O
LONG O
time O
. O
  O
All O
in O
all O
, O
this O
is O
a O
really O
good O
hair O
dryer O
, O
  O
If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
something O
on O
the O
smaller O
side O
, O
something O
lightweight O
, O
that O
does O
a O
great O
job O
quickly O
, O
this O
is O
a O
good O
option O

I O
like O
it O

It O
works O
for O
me O
well O
because O
I O
have O
thin O
hair O
, O
if O
you O
have O
thick O
hair O
or O
very O
long O
hair O
, O
you O
will O
spend O
five O
hours O
with O
it O

My O
4 O
star O
review O
is O
due O
to O
the O
concentrator O
, O
it O
fells O
off O
atleast O
once O
in O
your O
5 O
minute O
use O
which O
is O
a O
pain O
. O
If O
that O
does O
n't O
bother O
you O
then O
this O
is O
the O
perfect O
dryer O
which O
does O
n't O
occupy O
a O
lot O
of O
space O
like O
other O
fancy O
ones O

The O
concentrator O
helps O
reduce O
frizz O
from O
my O
frizzy O
hair O
and O
makes O
it O
easier O
to O
straighten O
. O
I O
have O
yet O
to O
use O
the O
diffuser O
but O
it O
's O
amazing O
overall O
! O
! O

Size O
is O
a O
little O
large O
but O
it O
works O
really O
well O
love O
the O
retractable O
cord O
. O

I O
received O
this O
in O
the O
mail O
and O
it O
came O
in O
a O
cute O
box O
packaged O
nice O
and O
tight O
. O
It O
was O
shipped O
in O
a O
timely O
manner O
and O
came O
to O
me O
in O
perfect O
condition O
. O
I O
love O
how O
compact O
this O
blow O
dryer O
is O
... O
I O
can O
take O
it O
with O
me O
when O
I O
go O
on O
vacation O
and O
It O
wo O
nt O
take O
up O
valuable O
space O
in O
my O
suitcase!!!I O
have O
the O
pink O
and O
black O
one O
and O
it O
is O
super O
cute O
! O
! O
I O
love O
how O
stylish O
it O
is O
. O
It O
comes O
with O
2 O
attachments O
( O
diffusers O
) O
. O
one O
is O
wider O
than O
the O
other O
one O
. O
They O
are O
easy O
to O
attach O
and O
easy O
to O
use O
. O
I O
love O
to O
use O
mine O
after O
blow O
drying O
my O
hair O
without O
one O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
and O
then O
finishing O
off O
with O
the O
diffuser O
  O
leaving O
my O
hair O
shiny O
and O
soft O
. O
The O
cord O
is O
long O
enough O
to O
be O
able O
to O
set O
at O
a O
table O
and O
dry O
your O
hair O
if O
need O
be O
The O
cord O
is O
strong O
and O
sturdy O
so O
it O
should O
last O
a O
long O
time O
. O
The O
dryer O
itself O
is O
very O
powerful O
.. O
I O
could O
not O
believe O
how O
hard O
it O
actually O
blows O
.. O
it O
comes O
with O
settings O
so O
that O
you O
can O
pick O
the O
one O
right O
for O
you O
and O
your O
hair O
.. O
I O
received O
this O
in O
exchange O
for O
my O
honest O
and O
unbiased O
review O
and O
I O
really O
think O
this O
is O
a O
great O
blow O
dryer O
and O
has O
a O
great O
price!!I O
will O
be O
using O
this O
for O
years O
to O
come O
! O
! O

Nice O
design O
and O
the O
night O
light O
is O
an O
added O
bonus O
. O

This O
hairdryer O
lasted O
maybe O
two O
weeks O
after O
which O
time O
it O
sounded O
like O
something O
broke O
internally O
and O
was O
quickly O
followed O
by O
a O
burning O
smell O
. O
I O
tried O
taking O
it O
apart O
to O
see O
if O
I O
could O
simply O
try O
removing O
whatever O
piece O
had O
gotten O
caught O
in O
the O
motor O
/ O
fan O
to O
no O
avail O
. O
Thus O
, O
had O
to O
trash O
it O
. O
I O
recommend O
getting O
a O
nicer O
hairdryer O
... O
something O
in O
the O
$ O
30 O
- O
$ O
40 O
range O
which O
will O
last O
a O
long O
time O
. O
  O
This O
was O
crap O
and O
I O
should O
have O
known O
better O
:) O

great O
dryer O
, O
and O
very O
cheap O
too O
! O

Love O
it O
! O
  O
Definitely O
a O
salon O
- O
style O
dryer O
; O
so O
much O
faster O
on O
my O
thick O
hair O
than O
conventional O
dryers O
. O

Very O
heavy O
for O
a O
small O
dryer O
but O
quality O
was O
great- O
drys O
my O
hair O
very O
quickly O
and O
packs O
nicely O
. O
I O
use O
this O
as O
a O
travel O
dryer O
. O

This O
is O
perfect O
for O
curly O
hair O
. O
The O
difuser O
piece O
gets O
popped O
in O
when O
you O
receive O
it O
and O
it O
does O
not O
fall O
out O
! O
Its O
there O
to O
stay O
. O
I O
love O
this O
product O
! O

I O
love O
it O
! O
! O
! O

I O
have O
had O
the O
Remington O
blow O
dryer O
for O
5 O
years O
but O
unfortunately O
I O
left O
it O
at O
my O
daughters O
home O
. O
  O
I O
have O
called O
a O
few O
times O
to O
get O
her O
to O
ship O
it O
back O
but O
she O
keeps O
forgetting O
so O
I O
bought O
another O
. O
  O
Love O
it O
just O
as O
well O
as O
my O
older O
one O
and O
looks O
the O
same O
except O
for O
color O
. O
  O
Found O
out O
my O
daughter O
loved O
the O
blow O
dryer O
which O
is O
why O
she O
kept O
forgetting O
to O
mail O
it O
back O
to O
me O
. O
  O
We O
both O
would O
recommend O
this O
hair O
blower O
.... O
especially O
if O
you O
have O
thick O
hair O
like O
we O
do O
. O
  O
It O
works O
great O
. O

This O
item O
died O
after O
maybe O
the O
10th O
time O
i O
used O
it O
. O
Good O
thing O
it O
is O
inexpensive O
. O
Save O
your O
money O
and O
do O
nt O
buy O
this O
, O
keep O
looking O
. O

installation O
was O
easy O
. O
Have O
not O
used O
it O
yet O
. O
Not O
too O
big O
or O
bulky O
. O

Love O
it O
. O
Drys O
my O
hair O
fast O
and O
now O
I O
can O
dry O
with O
one O
hand O
instead O
of O
two O
hands O
. O
It O
gets O
really O
hot O
two O
. O
Only O
use O
the O
small O
comb O
attachment O
. O
I O
wish O
it O
had O
a O
thicker O
brush O
attachment O
. O

The O
wattage O
is O
great O
. O
  O
However O
, O
the O
heat O
and O
fan O
controls O
seem O
to O
be O
in O
the O
way O
  O
on O
  O
the O
handle O
. O
  O
I O
need O
to O
  O
choke O
up O
closer O
to O
the O
heating O
area O
so O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
accidentally O
move O
the O
settings O
. O

When O
I O
ordered O
this O
hair O
dryer O
, O
I O
ordered O
the O
black O
with O
Pink O
petals O
. O
What O
I O
received O
was O
an O
all O
pink O
hair O
dryer O
. O
I O
was O
a O
little O
disappointed O
that O
I O
did O
n't O
receive O
the O
actual O
hair O
dryer O
that O
I O
ordered O
and O
I O
believe O
that O
the O
other O
hair O
dryer O
might O
have O
been O
better O
than O
this O
one O
. O
I O
have O
ordered O
other O
hair O
dryers O
from O
Xtava O
in O
the O
past O
and O
have O
been O
really O
impressed O
with O
the O
quality O
and O
performance O
of O
the O
hair O
dryers O
. O
This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
nice O
and O
small O
, O
so O
it O
is O
compact O
and O
easily O
fits O
even O
in O
a O
drawer O
. O
Even O
though O
it O
is O
small O
it O
is O
a O
powerful O
hair O
dryer O
and O
does O
dry O
my O
hair O
without O
frizzing O
it O
. O
To O
me O
it O
seemed O
a O
little O
heavy O
for O
it O
being O
such O
a O
small O
dryer O
. O
It O
was O
actually O
louder O
than O
my O
bigger O
hair O
dryers O
. O
It O
does O
have O
a O
nice O
long O
cord O
so O
I O
am O
able O
to O
move O
around O
more O
and O
not O
be O
confined O
in O
standing O
in O
one O
place O
. O
It O
does O
come O
with O
2 O
attachments O
1 O
nozzle O
is O
long O
and O
thin O
and O
the O
other O
is O
shorter O
and O
wider O
. O
It O
does O
have O
3 O
heat O
selections O
( O
low O
, O
medium O
and O
high O
) O
and O
does O
have O
2 O
speeds O
( O
gentle O
and O
strong O
) O
. O
The O
feature O
I O
like O
the O
best O
about O
the O
dryer O
is O
the O
cool O
air O
which O
shoots O
out O
a O
burst O
of O
cool O
air O
and O
that O
is O
why O
my O
hair O
does O
n't O
frizz O
when O
using O
this O
dryer O
. O
I O
was O
able O
to O
receive O
this O
hair O
dryer O
so O
that O
I O
can O
provide O
my O
honest O
opinion O
and O
feedback O
. O

The O
retractable O
cord O
is O
awesome O
and O
the O
airflow O
is O
good O
. O
Very O
nice O
product O
. O

I O
was O
definitely O
skeptical O
of O
paying O
this O
much O
for O
a O
hair O
dryer O
, O
especially O
one O
with O
a O
brand O
that O
I O
have O
never O
even O
heard O
of O
making O
hair O
dryers O
. O
  O
But O
the O
reviews O
were O
good O
so O
I O
decided O
I O
'd O
give O
it O
a O
try O
. O
I O
had O
really O
high O
expectations O
and O
they O
were O
definitely O
met O
! O
I O
LOVE O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
I O
have O
wavy O
/ O
curly O
hair O
and O
usually O
when O
I O
blow O
dry O
it O
, O
it O
gets O
really O
frizzy O
, O
this O
blow O
dryer O
gets O
rid O
of O
at O
least O
75 O
% O
of O
that O
friziness O
, O
if O
not O
more O
. O
And O
the O
diffuser O
it O
comes O
with O
is O
amazing O
! O
Another O
plus O
, O
is O
that O
it O
is O
soooo O
much O
quieter O
than O
any O
other O
blow O
dryer O
I O
've O
ever O
had O
! O
! O

This O
is O
absolutely O
the O
BEST O
hand O
hair O
dryer O
I O
have O
every O
had O
. O
  O
I O
have O
4B O
hair O
/ O
natural O
, O
  O
and O
it O
dries O
my O
hair O
in O
less O
time O
and O
straight O
! O
  O
You O
will O
not O
go O
wrong O
with O
this O

The O
Anemone O
wind O
flower O
1875 O
Blow O
dryer O
is O
amazing O
! O
! O
! O
  O
I O
Love O
it O
and O
so O
does O
the O
rest O
of O
my O
family O
. O
It O
has O
multiple O
heat O
speeds O
and O
a O
cold O
shot O
and O
trust O
me O
it O
gets O
cool O
, O
I O
put O
it O
on O
cold O
for O
me O
to O
feel O
and O
it O
was O
nice O
:) O
It O
dried O
my O
hair O
in O
a O
lot O
less O
time O
than O
most O
other O
blow O
dryers O
do O
and O
it O
comes O
with O
two O
removable O
nozzles O
so O
that O
you O
can O
dry O
your O
hair O
anyway O
you O
want O
to O
. O
I O
'm O
still O
stunned O
at O
how O
fast O
my O
hair O
dried O
. O
I O
have O
been O
through O
so O
many O
hair O
dryers O
and O
none O
of O
them O
came O
close O
to O
being O
this O
great O
! O
! O
I O
love O
the O
colors O
of O
it O
, O
the O
blue O
and O
black O
are O
perfect O
for O
me O
since O
that O
is O
my O
favorite O
colors:)I O
have O
long O
hair O
, O
not O
short O
so O
normally O
it O
really O
does O
take O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
. O
I O
'm O
in O
love O
with O
this O
blow O
dryer O
. O
I O
love O
that O
you O
have O
the O
choice O
of O
the O
colors O
, O
they O
are O
both O
really O
nice O
looking O
. O
This O
is O
such O
a O
amazing O
price O
for O
such O
a O
awesome O
hair O
dryer O
! O
! O
! O
I O
will O
end O
up O
buying O
another O
one O
just O
for O
my O
daughter O
to O
have O
, O
so O
she O
leaves O
mine O
alone:)I O
received O
this O
at O
little O
or O
at O
no O
cost O
to O
review O
and O
to O
give O
my O
unbias O
opinion O
and O
that O
is O
exactly O
what O
I O
have O
done O
. O
I O
wish O
I O
could O
take O
a O
picture O
, O
but O
the O
picture O
posted O
is O
exactly O
what O
it O
looks O
like O
:) O

Not O
as O
powerful O
on O
lower O
power O

Heavy O
, O
bad O
temperature O
and O
flow O
control O
. O
It O
is O
not O
handy O
at O
all O
. O
Bay O
Bliss O
hair O
dryer O
is O
much O
better O
and O
smaller O
. O

We O
actually O
bought O
this O
for O
drying O
the O
dog O
after O
his O
baths O
. O
He O
likes O
it O
a O
lot O
better O
than O
the O
others O
because O
it O
is O
much O
quieter O
on O
the O
low O
speed O
than O
what O
we O
used O
before O
. O
If O
you O
are O
in O
a O
hurry O
though O
, O
the O
high O
setting O
blows O
a O
lot O
of O
air O
, O
just O
not O
quite O
as O
much O
as O
your O
typical O
politician O
. O

For O
the O
price O
this O
is O
a O
good O
drier O
. O
It O
did O
get O
a O
little O
heavy O
while O
I O
was O
drying O
my O
hair O
. O
But O
I O
did O
think O
my O
hair O
looked O
shinier O
after O
. O
I O
would O
not O
call O
it O
professional O
quality O
by O
any O
means O
. O
I O
would O
say O
it O
is O
worth O
it O
if O
you O
're O
just O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
cheap O
hair O
dryer O
. O

Why O
was O
n't O
I O
using O
a O
remington O
before O
. O
These O
are O
way O
better O
than O
the O
one O
I O
was O
using O
before O
from O
Revlon.10 O
stars O
. O

This O
works O
good O
, O
but O
not O
as O
good O
as O
my O
old O
one O
that O
I O
got O
at O
Walmart O
for O
$ O
15.00 O
. O
  O
It O
's O
a O
little O
heavy O
and O
somewhat O
bulky O
but O
I O
like O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
cord O
recoils O
inside O
. O
  O
It O
keeps O
it O
out O
of O
the O
way O
, O
but O
the O
cord O
is O
not O
very O
long O
so O
you O
must O
stay O
close O
to O
the O
outlet O
. O
  O
I O
have O
very O
long O
hair O
and O
my O
old O
blow O
dryer O
dries O
my O
hair O
a O
lot O
faster O
than O
this O
one O
does O
. O
I O
had O
no O
need O
for O
the O
attachements O
so O
I O
tossed O
them O
in O
the O
trash O
. O
  O
It O
works O
OK O
, O
nothing O
to O
write O
home O
about O
. O

Picked O
this O
out O
after O
using O
it O
in O
a O
hotel O
. O
I O
've O
had O
it O
in O
3 O
or O
4 O
hotels O
since O
then O
. O
It O
has O
a O
Medium O
speed O
which O
is O
rare O
, O
and O
the O
Cool O
setting O
, O
which O
I O
love O
. O
And O
it O
was O
reasonably O
priced O
! O

love O
it O

This O
hair O
dryer O
works O
well O
, O
dries O
my O
hair O
quicker O
than O
others O
I O
've O
used O
in O
the O
past O
. O
My O
only O
complaint O
is O
the O
weight O
, O
could O
be O
lighter O
. O

Very O
nice O
and O
lighter O
weight O
than O
previous O
models O
. O
  O
Dries O
well O
. O

A O
very O
good O
value O
for O
the O
money O
. O
  O
The O
on O
/ O
off O
switch O
is O
a O
little O
hard O
for O
arthritic O
hands O
to O
use O
, O
but O
not O
a O
deal O
breaker O
. O
  O
Dries O
my O
wifes O
curly O
hair O
very O
quickly O
. O

This O
hairdryer O
is O
a O
definite O
upgrade O
from O
my O
old O
Conair O
one O
. O
  O
It O
is O
fast O
, O
and O
seems O
to O
leave O
my O
hair O
nice O
and O
shiny O
. O
My O
hair O
still O
seems O
a O
bit O
frizzy O
on O
top O
, O
but O
that O
could O
just O
be O
my O
hair O
or O
that O
fact O
that O
I O
live O
in O
a O
very O
humid O
climate O
. O
  O
The O
volume O
is O
pretty O
good O
. O
  O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
I O
would O
necessarily O
call O
it O
quiet O
though O
. O
The O
weight O
is O
also O
decent O
, O
but O
I O
would O
not O
say O
it O
is O
extremely O
light O
or O
anything O
. O
I O
read O
on O
at O
least O
one O
of O
the O
other O
reviews O
that O
the O
power O
cord O
was O
just O
a O
regualr O
plug O
, O
but O
mine O
was O
one O
of O
those O
safety O
kinds O
. O
  O
Overall O
, O
it O
is O
a O
great O
hairdryer O
for O
the O
price O
! O

Love O
this O
blowdryer- O
do O
n't O
like O
how O
the O
nozzle O
on O
the O
front O
pops O
off O
on O
it O
's O
own O
, O
but O
it O
has O
reduced O
frizz O
. O

Quality O
hair O
dryer O
, O
this O
really O
moves O
some O
air O
. O

Great O
product O
, O
looks O
and O
preformance O
. O

When O
we O
got O
this O
hair O
dryer O
we O
wanted O
one O
that O
would O
n't O
cause O
fly O
away O
hair O
. O
This O
certainly O
lives O
up O
to O
the O
claims O
. O
Also O
this O
dryer O
has O
individual O
controls O
for O
speed O
and O
heat O
. O
I O
really O
like O
that O
, O
because O
most O
of O
the O
time O
I O
do O
n't O
need O
high O
heat O
but O
do O
want O
more O
blowing O
power O
. O
It O
also O
is O
n't O
very O
noisy O
as O
far O
as O
hair O
dryers O
go O
. O

I O
returned O
it O
. O

It O
works O
great O
. O

these O
dryers O
are O
the O
best O
, O
last O
forever O

Powerful O
hair O
dryer O
-- O
adding O
volume O
to O
your O
hair O
. O
The O
hot O
mode O
could O
be O
super O
hot O
so O
you O
get O
to O
be O
careful O
. O

Best O
blow O
dry O
ever O
, O
I O
have O
been O
buying O
these O
for O
years O
.. O

Good O
product O
for O
an O
amazing O
price O
! O

Great O
hair O
dryer O
. O
Dries O
my O
hair O
great O
for O
thick O
hair O
. O

Love O
it O
. O
Perfect O
for O
travelling O
! O
I O
used O
this O
when O
I O
went O
to O
Norway O
last O
spring O
. O
Not O
only O
did O
it O
work O
well O
with O
the O
converter O
, O
it O
was O
also O
very O
high O
powered O
for O
such O
a O
small O
dryer O
. O

I O
had O
2 O
originals O
of O
these O
hair O
dryers O
they O
worked O
great O
for O
years O
. O
  O
I O
still O
have O
one O
but O
one O
the O
other O
one O
broke O
I O
reordered O
this O
one O
must O
have O
cheaper O
parts O
it O
completely O
broke O
in O
5 O
months O

I O
had O
a O
cord O
keeper O
for O
years O
. O
  O
This O
is O
a O
nice O
hair O
dryer O
with O
all O
the O
options O
and O
attachments O
I O
need O
. O
  O
It O
is O
a O
bit O
larger O
than O
my O
older O
version O
. O
  O
I O
will O
keep O
looking O
for O
one O
that O
is O
lighter O
weight O
and O
smaller O
. O
  O
I O
really O
, O
really O
liked O
my O
older O
one O
. O

Have O
it O
mounted O
in O
the O
not O
quite O
finished O
bathroom O
yet O
. O
  O
Looks O
good O
so O
far O
- O
But O
have O
n't O
used O
it O
yet O
. O

This O
is O
my O
second O
time O
buying O
this O
hair O
blower O
. O
I O
love O
it O
so O
much O
! O

it O
does O
n't O
work O
when O
I O
plugged O
it O
in O
it O
did O
n't O
work O
how O
do O
I O
return O
it O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
replacement O
for O
my O
old O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
All O
3 O
attachments O
work O
great O
for O
however O
I O
want O
to O
style O
my O
hair O
. O
  O
This O
dryer O
motor O
is O
occasionally O
  O
makes O
a O
loud O
grinding O
sound O
but O
it O
continues O
to O
work O
. O

works O
great O
. O

The O
biggest O
waste O
of O
money O
I O
've O
ever O
spent O
. O
This O
drier O
has O
to O
be O
a O
fake O
t3 O
because O
I O
've O
used O
a O
t3 O
for O
many O
years O
and O
loved O
it O
. O
This O
drier O
however O
gets O
hot O
enough O
, O
but O
there O
's O
absolutely O
no O
power O
behind O
it O
to O
blow O
dry O
the O
hair O
. O
Essentially O
it O
's O
just O
barely O
blowing O
while O
heating O
up O
my O
hair O
. O
My O
hair O
takes O
forever O
to O
dry O
with O
this O
thing O
and O
after O
its O
finally O
dry O
it O
's O
a O
frizzy O
mess O
. O
This O
company O
seems O
dishonest O
as O
well O
because O
in O
the O
box O
there O
was O
a O
large O
piece O
of O
paper O
stating O
that O
they O
'll O
give O
a O
lifetime O
warranty O
if O
I O
give O
a O
good O
review O
! O
So O
they O
're O
not O
standing O
by O
their O
product O
but O
instead O
they O
're O
essentially O
trying O
to O
pay O
me O
to O
lie O
! O
I O
'm O
sorry O
, O
but O
I O
have O
to O
be O
honest O
and O
the O
drier O
is O
a O
piece O
of O
junk O
. O

This O
dryer O
is O
fantastic O
. O
Hair O
is O
silky O
and O
smooth O
when O
dry O
and O
if O
you O
purchase O
the O
attachment O
it O
does O
a O
good O
job O
of O
straightening O
hair O
while O
drying O
it O
. O
I O
would O
purchase O
again O
. O

DO O
NOT O
BUY O
! O
Lasted O
1 O
Week!- O
Gets O
Hot O
and O
Quits O
in O
less O
then O
3 O
minutes- O
needs O
to O
cool O
off O
then O
will O
work O
for O
another O
3 O
minutes!Aggravating O
and O
not O
worth O
  O
the O
time O
to O
order O
this O
product O
. O

I O
travel O
frequently O
and O
love O
this O
hairdryer O
because O
the O
dual O
voltage O
allows O
me O
to O
use O
it O
anywhere O
and O
it O
is O
light O
to O
handle O
and O
small O
to O
pack O
in O
my O
luggage O
. O

Does O
the O
job O
. O
Dries O
my O
hair O
. O
Not O
fast O
, O
but O
it O
also O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
make O
my O
hair O
like O
a O
burnt O
crisp O
. O
So O
, O
all O
good O
. O

It O
's O
an O
ok O
drier O
but O
there O
are O
so O
many O
better O
options O
out O
there O
with O
a O
stronger O
motor O
. O
The O
airflow O
is O
weak O
even O
on O
the O
highest O
setting O
. O
It O
says O
its O
a O
1875w O
drier O
but O
it O
dries O
the O
hair O
more O
like O
a O
1200w O
one O
. O
Also O
it O
is O
quite O
bulky O
. O
It O
does O
reduce O
frizz O
and O
improve O
the O
shine O
. O
I O
recommend O
it O
to O
a O
person O
with O
short O
and O
fine O
hair O
. O
If O
you O
have O
coarse O
or O
curly O
hair O
, O
I O
would O
n't O
pick O
this O
one O
. O

Arrived O
ahead O
of O
schedule O
, O
good O
price O
. O

Small O
, O
easy O
to O
mount O
. O
  O
Does O
the O
job O

just O
what O
we O
wanted O
. O
size O
is O
great O
and O
very O
compact O
. O

Love O
it O
and O
use O
it O
daily O
. O
  O
So O
convenient O
. O

Where O
has O
this O
been O
my O
whole O
life O
? O
! O
? O
? O
This O
is O
honestly O
the O
best O
hair O
dryer O
ever O
. O

Great O
product O
I O
read O
reviews O
so O
kept O
my O
unit O
on O
low O
! O
Wow O
! O
  O
Low O
gets O
really O
hot O
so O
it O
does O
the O
job O
so O
far O
woo O
hoo O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O

Bought O
this O
item O
twice O
. O
The O
first O
unit O
lasted O
about O
two O
years O
which O
I O
thought O
was O
a O
bit O
short O
but O
it O
was O
convenient O
, O
worked O
well O
and O
seemed O
worth O
a O
second O
try O
. O
Maybe O
the O
one O
I O
got O
just O
was O
not O
a O
good O
one O
. O
Our O
use O
was O
far O
from O
excessive O
. O
It O
was O
mounted O
in O
a O
master O
bath O
where O
only O
my O
wife O
and O
I O
used O
it O
. O
We O
both O
have O
short O
hair O
. O
The O
second O
unit O
I O
purchased O
had O
an O
additional O
issue O
. O
Though O
the O
price O
was O
about O
the O
same O
, O
the O
cord O
from O
the O
unit O
base O
to O
the O
wall O
outlet O
was O
significantly O
shorter O
than O
on O
the O
first O
. O
I O
guess O
they O
saved O
a O
few O
bucks O
by O
providing O
a O
shorter O
outlet O
cord O
( O
now O
about O
2 O
- O
3 O
fee)t O
. O
I O
accommodated O
this O
though O
the O
wall O
setup O
did O
not O
look O
as O
tidy O
as O
the O
first O
unit O
as O
I O
did O
not O
have O
a O
long O
enough O
cord O
to O
reach O
the O
outlet O
. O
The O
bigger O
concern O
is O
that O
2 O
years O
later O
it O
stopped O
functioning O
again O
. O
Rather O
than O
buy O
another O
wall O
mounted O
unit O
, O
I O
bought O
an O
aluminum O
generic O
hair O
dryer O
wall O
mount O
  O
and O
purchased O
an O
inexpensive O
hair O
dryer O
than O
I O
can O
easily O
replace O
in O
the O
future O
as O
the O
need O
arises O
. O

Very O
good O
. O
Pleasantly O
surprise O

This O
dryer O
is O
awesome O
, O
the O
accessory O
allows O
me O
to O
pinpoint O
a O
section O
of O
hair O
for O
styling O
/ O
drying O
purposes O
and O
has O
a O
cool O
setting O
which O
sets O
the O
style O
in O
place O
, O
handle O
does O
not O
fold O
in O
but O
luckily O
I O
have O
drawer O
space O
. O

Excellent O
! O

excellent O
product O
, O
very O
good O
at O
relationship O
between O
Quality O
vs O
Price O
, O
recommended O
100 O
% O

is O
kind O
of O
different O
to O
the O
picture O
one O
, O
but O
the O
stylish O
on O
my O
hair O
it O
was O
as O
expected O

Very O
powerful O
for O
such O
a O
small O
blow O
dryer O
. O

I O
gave O
it O
one O
star O
because O

  O
It O

not O
work O
in O
Israel O
even O

we O
had O
top O
of O
the O
line O
converters O

  O
In O
America O
, O
it O
was O
wimpy O
and O
hard O
to O
hold O
. O
  O
The O
voltage O
switcher O
on O
the O
dryer O
did O
not O
really O
exist O
. O
  O
Find O

Good O

Great O

Great O

decided O
to O
use O
it O
to O
take O
decals O
off O
our O
truck O
.... O
he O
used O
it O
for O
4 O
hrs O
straight O
on O
high O
heat O
and O
i O
was O
a O
bit O
nervous O
it O
would O
die O
out O
on O
me O
pretty O
quick O
afterward O
but O
its O
4 O
mos O
later O
and O
still O
as O
good O
as O
when O
i O
bought O
it O
! O
! O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
product O
! O
! O

This O
was O
a O
birthday O
present O
for O
my O
long O
- O
haired O
daughter O
and O
she O
loves O
it O
. O

It O
dries O
your O
hair O
. O
Not O
much O
else O
to O
say O
. O

I O
had O
this O
blow O
dryer O
before O
but O
i O
dropped O
it O
had O
to O
get O
another O
one O
. O
And O
i O
luv O
it O

My O
wife O
like O
the O
power O
and O
size O
. O
  O
I O
think O
it O
is O
a O
bit O
loud O
. O
  O
Easy O
to O
mount O
and O
it O
does O
n't O
take O
up O
much O
space O
. O

Great O
power O
. O
  O
I O
should O
n't O
have O
waited O
so O
long O
to O
purchase O
it O
. O
  O
Dries O
hair O
more O
quickly O
than O
any O
other O
dryer O
- O
by O
far O
! O
  O
Worth O
the O
extra O
money O
. O

My O
previous O
dryer O
finally O
died O
. O
  O
I O
really O
like O
this O
one O
. O
  O
It O
does O
n't O
collapse O
, O
but O
that O
was O
one O
of O
the O
breaking O
points O
on O
my O
previous O
one O
. O
  O
I O
like O
the O
  O
variation O
in O
temperatures O
& O
speed O
. O
  O
I O
took O
off O
the O
nozzle O
because O
it O
seemed O
to O
concentrate O
the O
air O
too O
much O
... O
I O
do O
n't O
really O
like O
to O
spend O
too O
much O
time O
on O
my O
hair O
, O
just O
the O
minimum O
to O
make O
it O
look O
good O
. O
  O
The O
diffuser O
seems O
pretty O
good O
, O
but O
I O
have O
n't O
tried O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
curly O
yet O
. O
  O
I O
really O
like O
that O
the O
back O
vent O
can O
be O
cleaned O
. O

Great O
blow O
dryer O
definitely O
better O
then O
I O
was O
expecting O

Bought O
for O
a O
present O
.. O
was O
well O
liked O
! O

Great O
for O
traveling O
. O
It O
takes O
up O
very O
little O
space O
and O
weighs O
next O
to O
nothing O
! O

I O
decided O
to O
purchase O
this O
hair O
dryer O
after O
using O
it O
during O
a O
recent O
hotel O
stay O
. O
  O
I O
was O
drawn O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
does O
not O
emanate O
the O
same O
high O
- O
pitched O
tone O
that O
my O
prior O
Conair O
makes O
( O
which O
is O
also O
an O
1875 O
but O
has O
added O
features O
such O
as O
cool O
air O
and O
turbo O
settings O
) O
. O
  O
I O
'm O
very O
happy O
with O
my O
purchase O
. O
  O
The O
hair O
dryer O
is O
VERY O
lightweight O
, O
cheap O
, O
and O
hot O
enough O
to O
get O
the O
job O
done O
. O
  O
Most O
importantly O
to O
me O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
feel O
like O
I O
'm O
damaging O
my O
hearing O
when O
I O
use O
it O
. O
  O
I O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

Excellent O
dryer O
for O
the O
price O
! O
I O
've O
owned O
Hot O
Tools O
and O
other O
Conair O
dryers O
in O
the O
past O
, O
and O
so O
far O
this O
one O
has O
been O
the O
best O
. O
I O
bought O
this O
one O
to O
replace O
my O
older O
model O
Conair O
dryer O
that O
went O
out O
after O
4 O
years O
of O
use O
. O
I O
really O
like O
that O
this O
one O
has O
the O
switch O
for O
the O
cool O
setting O
, O
rather O
than O
having O
to O
hold O
the O
blue O
button O
to O
get O
the O
cold O
blast O
( O
although O
it O
still O
has O
that O
button O
as O
an O
option O
) O
. O
It O
's O
not O
as O
quiet O
as O
my O
last O
dryer O
, O
but O
my O
hair O
gets O
dryer O
faster O
without O
drying O
out O
the O
ends O
or O
creating O
static O
. O
My O
hair O
actually O
looks O
more O
shiny O
/ O
silky O
after O
using O
this O
one O
than O
it O
did O
with O
the O
older O
model O
. O

Excellent O
produce O

For O
the O
price O
, O
this O
is O
a O
great O
little O
hairdryer O
. O
  O
Folds O
nicely O
. O
  O
Wish O
it O
had O
a O
retractable O
cord O
, O
though O
. O

Nice O

Xtava O
Rimini O
1800w O
Iconic O
Hair O
Dryer O
with O
Diffuser O
is O
awesome O
! O
It O
's O
light O
weight O
, O
heats O
up O
quickly O
and O
works O
wonderfully O
. O
The O
diffuser O
helps O
keep O
hair O
frizz O
free O
and O
shiny O
, O
which O
is O
great O
. O
There O
are O
not O
only O
three O
heat O
levels O
, O
but O
two O
power O
levels O
, O
so O
there O
are O
loads O
of O
options O
to O
get O
the O
perfect O
setting O
for O
you!!I O
am O
thrilled O
to O
have O
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
review O
this O
Xtava O
Hair O
Dryer O
. O
All O
opinions O
are O
my O
own O
and O
not O
influenced O
in O
any O
way O
. O

Just O
wish O
the O
tube O
was O
longer O
. O
If O
your O
hair O
is O
too O
near O
the O
air O
intake O
, O
it O
sucks O
it O
in O
. O
Otherwise O
very O
good O
product O
. O

I O
was O
in O
desperate O
need O
of O
a O
new O
blow O
dryer O
but O
very O
hesitant O
to O
purchase O
because O
I O
have O
attempted O
twice O
over O
the O
years O
to O
get O
a O
new O
, O
updated O
one O
but O
both O
broke O
quickly O
and O
did O
n’t O
work O
as O
good O
as O
my O
15 O
year O
old O
blow O
dryer O
. O
The O
Xtava O
Rimini O
1500W O
Ionic O
Hair O
Dryer O
really O
surprised O
me O
. O
I O
mean O
, O
really O
. O
First O
, O
it O
is O
insanely O
lightweight O
( O
I O
think O
they O
say O
“ O
ultra O
- O
lightweight O
” O
) O
. O
There O
are O
3 O
heat O
levels O
and O
2 O
power O
levels O
and O
it O
comes O
with O
two O
attachments O
- O
a O
diffuser O
to O
help O
eliminate O
frizz O
and O
give O
more O
volume O
and O
a O
Concentrator O
Nozzle O
for O
focusing O
on O
just O
one O
area O
of O
your O
hair O
to O
dry O
that O
area O
more O
rapidly O
. O
Now O
, O
for O
how O
it O
performed O
- O
I O
have O
long O
, O
wavy O
, O
medium O
- O
thickness O
hair O
( O
and O
lots O
of O
it O
) O
that O
tends O
to O
get O
frizzy O
with O
heat O
products O
( O
so O
I O
limit O
them O
! O
) O
I O
generally O
spend O
35 O
- O
40 O
minutes O
to O
get O
this O
hair O
dried O
with O
a O
blow O
dryer O
. O
This O
, O
combined O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
was O
in O
a O
bad O
car O
accident O
and O
it O
can O
get O
really O
painful O
when O
I O
am O
styling O
my O
hair O
for O
so O
long O
means O
I O
throw O
mousse O
in O
and O
let O
it O
air O
- O
dry O
wavy O
/ O
curly O
more O
often O
than O
not O
. O
NOT O
ANYMORE O
. O
I O
LOVE O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
It O
took O
only O
20 O
minutes O
to O
completely O
dry O
my O
hair O
with O
the O
diffuser O
. O
And O
, O
my O
hair O
looked O
FABULOUS O
. O
It O
made O
my O
hair O
so O
smooth O
and O
soft O
and O
with O
no O
frizz O
! O
! O
! O
I O
did O
n’t O
need O
to O
use O
extra O
smoothing O
lotions O
or O
serums O
like O
I O
usually O
do O
! O
The O
cool O
shot O
button O
helps O
to O
“ O
set O
” O
the O
style O
and O
it O
also O
helps O
reduce O
frizz O
and O
boost O
shine O
( O
my O
old O
one O
did O
n’t O
have O
one O
of O
these!)I O
can O
not O
recommend O
this O
enough O
! O
I O
wish O
Amazon O
was O
n’t O
out O
of O
stock O
so O
I O
could O
purchase O
one O
for O
my O
sister O
. O
She O
’s O
always O
replacing O

The O
best O
wall O
mounted O
dryer O
I O
've O
found O
! O
  O
I O
also O
love O
the O
little O
night O
light O
as O
it O
's O
enough O
to O
light O
my O
way O
to O
the O
bathroom O
at O
night O
! O

Way O
better O
than O
my O
previous O
dryer O
. O
I O
was O
cheap O
. O
I O
was O
trying O
to O
save O
money O
for O
a O
while O
... O
in O
the O
worst O
ways O
possible O
. O
I O
ended O
up O
buying O
this O
$ O
11 O
dryer O
because O
it O
was O
cheap O
. O
  O
And O
for O
a O
year O
, O
I O
went O
around O
with O
wet O
hair O
. O
I O
tried O
to O
tell O
myself O
that O
it O
was O
okay O
because O
of O
all O
the O
money O
I O
was O
saving O
. O
But O
it O
did O
not O
feel O
okay O
. O
I O
finally O
ended O
up O
getting O
this O
dryer O
though O
and O
it O
was O
like O
night O
and O
day O
. O
This O
dryer O
works O
so O
quickly O
. O
It O
makes O
you O
save O
time O
and O
time O
is O
the O
most O
precious O
resource O
of O
all O
. O
It O
will O
dry O
hair O
quickly O
and O
efficiently O
. O
  O
I O
do O
not O
use O
any O
of O
the O
attachments O
that O
come O
with O
it O
. O
But O
if O
you O
style O
your O
hair O
, O
just O
know O
, O
those O
are O
options O
too O
. O

Just O
with O
the O
bonnet O
was O
easier O
to O
fit O
over O
rollers O
. O
but O
otherwise O
a O
good O
machine O
. O

I O
love O
the O
item O
. O
It O
has O
become O
very O
much O
easier O
to O
dry O
my O
dreds O

Thank O

trip O
oversees O
. O
  O
Would O
not O
refund O
me O
because O
too O
much O
time O
had O
passed O
. O
Big O
rip O
off O

I O
had O
this O
hair O
dryer O
for O
approximately O
seven O
years O
before O
it O
finally O
broke O
. O
I O
never O
used O
any O
of O
the O
attachments O
so O
I O
ca O
n't O
comment O
on O
those O
, O
but O
the O
blow O
dryer O
itself O
worked O
great O
. O
What O
finally O
broke O
was O
actually O
the O
cord O
it O
seems O
. O
If O
you O
held O
the O
cord O
where O
it O
attached O
to O
the O
base O
at O
just O
the O
right O
angle O
it O
would O
work O
again O
, O
so O
the O
dryer O
itself O
was O
actually O
still O
kicking O
after O
7 O
years O
. O

Love O
this O
. O

my O
home O
use O
blower O
. O
works O
well O
! O

Looks O
and O
works O
great O

Girlfriend O
likes O
it O
. O
However O
, O
does O
n't O
feel O
as O
powerful O
as O
the O
previous O
version O

Drys O
my O
hair O
fast O
and O
effectively O
:) O

I O
love O
it O
, O
I O
have O
been O
trying O
to O
find O
one O
for O
two O
years O
. O

i O
had O
a O
professional O
hair O
dryer O
and O
it O
broke O
, O
i O
picked O
this O
one O
based O
on O
the O
reviews O
and O
the O
price O
and O
i O
love O
it O
. O
it O
takes O
me O
15 O
min O
to O
dry O
my O
medium O
hair O
and O
it O
does O
nt O
cause O
a O
lot O
of O
frizz O
. O

buen O
producto O

I O
like O
the O
silky O
feel O
this O
hair O
dryer O
gives O
my O
hair O
. O
  O
I O
bought O
the O
same O
kind O
to O
replace O
an O
old O
one O
. O

Great O
dryer O
, O
convenient O
wall O
access O

This O
dryer O
is O
hard O
to O
turn O
on O
and O
off O

Great O
for O
blowouts O
! O
! O
! O

As O
much O
as O
I O
hate O
to O
admit O
it O
, O
in O
conjunction O
with O
the O
Cricket O
Technique O
400 O
thermal O
brush O
, O
my O
hair O
is O
as O
closest O
to O
a O
salon O
blowout O
as O
I O
have O
ever O
gotten O
it O
! O
It O
feels O
light O
and O
airy O
like O
it O
does O
when O
I O
leave O
my O
hairdresser O
. O
It O
is O
relatively O
quiet O
, O
the O
design O
is O
very O
nice O
- O
I O
like O
the O
smoothness O
of O
the O
handle O
. O
Love O
that O
it O
comes O
with O
concentrator O
and O
diffuser O
as O
I O
use O
both O
since O
I O
have O
naturally O
curly O
curly O
hair O
! O
I O
am O
pleased O
with O
this O
and O
will O
update O
later O
if O
need O
be O
because O
I O
JUST O
received O
it O
in O
the O
mail O
today O
. O
I O
also O
have O
long O
hair O
and O
did O
n't O
have O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
back O
as O
some O
others O
have O
. O

I O
looooove O
looooove O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
It O
's O
lightweight O
and O
has O
cut O
my O
drying O
time O
in O
HALF O
! O

Best O
hairdryer O
ever O
! O

I O
had O
on O
of O
these O
for O
12 O
years O
. O
  O
It O
finally O
gave O
up O
the O
ghost O
. O
  O
Works O
perfectly O
and O
is O
so O
convenient O
to O
have O
right O
on O
the O
bathroom O
wall O
. O
  O
Added O
bonus O
- O
more O
wattage O
with O
the O
new O
one O
! O

I O
like O
the O
temperature O
settings O
of O
cool O
, O
warm O
and O
hot O
but O
would O
like O
this O
dryer O
more O
if O
the O
flow O
of O
air O
were O
stronger O
when O
set O
on O
high O
. O
  O
It O
seems O
to O
take O
longer O
for O
my O
hair O
to O
dry O
with O
this O
dryer O
. O

Amazing O

WORKS O
WELL O

This O
hair O
dryer O
works O
super O
well O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
find O
the O
sound O
level O
much O
different O
from O
other O
hair O
dryers O
as O
some O
have O
complained O
. O
I O
appreciate O
all O
of O
the O
different O
settings O
( O
3 O
heat O
settings O
, O
Hi O
/ O
Med O
/ O
Low O
power O
, O
and O
teh O
different O
Wattage O
rankings O
) O
. O
The O
concentrater O
actually O
stays O
on O
the O
dryer O
, O
which O
is O
not O
what O
I O
have O
experienced O
in O
the O
past O
. O
Also O
, O
the O
cord O
retraction O
is O
not O
perfect O
; O
it O
sometimes O
  O
leaves O
an O
extra O
6 O
inches O
out O
, O
but O
I O
actually O
find O
it O
better O
than O
other O
cord O
retraction O
models O
. O
Since O
it O
is O
a O
full O
size O
blow O
dryer O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
expect O
it O
to O
be O
compact O
and O
the O
additional O
cord O
is O
a O
non O
- O
issue O
for O
me O
. O
Glad O
I O
happened O
upon O
this O
model O
. O

I O
have O
had O
this O
blowdryer O
for O
about O
a O
year O
and O
it O
already O
died O
. O
  O
Ironically O
, O
it O
is O
the O
most O
expensive O
blow O
dryer O
I O
have O
ever O
bought O
and O
shortest O
life O
as O
well O
. O
  O
Disappointing O
... O

Best O
blowdryer O
ever O
. O
  O
This O
is O
my O
second O
T3 O
because O
the O
airline O
broke O
my O
first O
one O
pitching O
my O
luggage O
. O
Drys O
super O
fast O
and O
less O
damaging O
. O

Love O

just O
prefect O
for O
me O
. O

works O
, O
retractable O
cord O
is O
nice O

I O
have O
not O
had O
chance O
to O
use O
it O
allot O
, O
but O
so O
far O
so O
good O
:) O

Great O
dryer O
, O
just O
a O
little O
heavy O
and O
... O
the O
buttons O
are O
very O
flat O
, O
making O
it O
hard O
to O
slide O
on O
and O
off O
. O

So O
far O
works O
well O
! O

I O
purchased O
this O
for O
my O
vacation O
home O
. O
  O
I O
liked O
it O
so O
much O
I O
brought O
it O
home O
and O
took O
the O
more O
expensive O
dryer O
I O
was O
using O
at O
home O
to O
my O
vacation O
home O
. O

As O
advertised O
, O
works O
great O
MUCH O
faster O
than O
my O
precious O
dryer O
. O
The O
buttons O
on O
the O
handle O
are O
a O
bit O
awkward O
but O
I O
'll O
get O
used O
to O
it O
. O

I O
  O

Cons O
: O
Too O
big O
to O
be O
a O
good O
travel O
dryer O
Not O
very O
powerful O
, O
even O
on O
the O
highest O
setting O
Takes O
a O
long O
time O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
, O
and O
it O
' O
  O
s O
super O
short O
Does O
not O
seem O
very O
sturdy O
  O
Pros O
: O
Relatively O
quiet O
Decreases O
frizz O

This O
unit O
began O
to O
self O
destruct O
this O
morning O
discharging O
internal O
shrapnal O
and O
vibrating O
while O
releasing O
a O
death O
sound O
. O
Despite O
being O
treated O
with O
the O
utmost O
respect O
it O
will O
join O
the O
pile O
of O
cheap O
Chinese O
junk O
I O
have O
accumulated O
over O
the O
yearsIt O
almost O
made O
it O
to O
it O
's O
second O
birthday O
. O
PitifulI O
purchased O
a O
Panasonic O
and O
a O
seperate O
wall O
bracket O
as O
a O
replacementIt O
is O
most O
likely O
chinese O
made O
as O
well O
but O
the O
design O
should O
long O
outlast O
generics O

I O
amd O
black O
and O
I O
have O
natural O
hair O
and O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
this O
blowdryer O
will O
be O
perfect O
for O
anyone O
! O

I O
got O
this O
and O
was O
excited O
because O
of O
the O
reviews O
. O
It O
does O
dry O
my O
hair O
but O
takes O
longer O
than O
my O
drugstore O
dryer O
, O
but O
might O
be O
healthier O
. O
The O
attachments O
do O
NOT O
stay O
on O
making O
them O
almost O
useless O
. O
I O
tried O
to O
return O
it O
but O
my O
husband O
threw O
away O
the O
box O
, O
so O
I O
'm O
stuck O
. O
I O
can O
say O
it O
's O
pretty O
and O
I O
like O
the O
cool O
shot O
, O
but O
it O
does O
NOT O
lock O
as O
described O
.... O
you O
have O
to O
hold O
it O
down O
the O
whole O
time O
. O
Also O
, O
the O
plug O
is O
too O
narrow O
. O
It O
keeps O
coming O
unplugged O
because O
it O
's O
too O
loose O
. O
It O
's O
easy O
to O
accidentally O
change O
settings O
or O
turn O
it O
off O
when O
in O
use O
because O
of O
button O
placement O
, O
but O
starting O
to O
get O
use O
to O
it O
. O

NO O
complaint O
. O
It O
is O
very O
powerful O
for O
the O
size O
. O

Was O
great O
while O
it O
lasted O
, O
but O
the O
first O
time O
I O
tripped O
over O
the O
cord O
it O
toppled O
over O
and O
never O
worked O
again O
... O
and O
it O
had O
been O
90 O
days O
, O
so O
no O
refund O
or O
exchange O
. O

I O
like O
this O
product O

my O
bathroom O
looks O
neater O

i O
bought O
this O
as O
a O

Excellent O
product O
. O
Recommended O

This O
hairdryer O
is O
great O
! O
  O
It O
has O
3 O
choices O
of O
speed O
and O
3 O
heat O
settings O
, O
cool O
, O
warm O
and O
hot O
. O
  O
This O
is O
the O
best O
hairdryer O
I O
've O
ever O
had O
! O
! O

It O
's O
a O
hair O
dryer O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
horrible O
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O
spectacular O
, O
not O
like O
some O
of O
the O
other O
Xtava O
products O
I O
have O
used O
in O
the O
past O
. O
It O
does O
n't O
look O
it O
, O
but O
it O
is O
lightweight O
and O
it O
's O
a O
really O
nice O
color O
blue O
. O
It O
comes O
with O
two O
attachments O
; O
a O
big O
customized O
diffuser O
and O
a O
concentrated O
nozzle O
for O
targeting O
styling O
. O
The O
diffuser O
was O
a O
little O
difficult O
to O
get O
on O
. O
It O
did O
n't O
fit O
as O
good O
as O
the O
concentrated O
nozzle O
. O
I O
also O
liked O
that O
it O
has O
a O
long O
cord O
which O
made O
it O
easier O
for O
me O
to O
move O
around O
when O
needed O
. O
This O
Rimini O
hair O
dryer O
comes O
with O
three O
heat O
levels O
, O
two O
power O
levels O
and O
a O
cool O
shot O
button O
to O
set O
your O
style O
. O
The O
different O
settings O
and O
attachments O
did O
make O
it O
easier O
when O
styling O
my O
hair O
. O
I O
could O
set O
them O
to O
what O
ever O
I O
needed O
them O
to O
be O
, O
when O
I O
needed O
them O
. O
I O
've O
never O
uses O
such O
a O
big O
diffuser O
like O
this O
before O
. O
It O
did O
dry O
my O
hair O
quickly O
, O
but O
I O
have O
very O
fine O
hair O
, O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
need O
a O
lot O
of O
heat O
. O
It O
did O
help O
with O
the O
frizz O
and O
left O
my O
hair O
feeling O
smooth O
. O
I O
felt O
that O
it O
could O
have O
had O
a O
bit O
more O
power O
to O
it O
, O
but O
it O
was O
okay O
. O
For O
people O
with O
thicker O
hair O
, O
it O
might O
take O
a O
little O
longer O
to O
dry O
. O
Overall O
, O
this O
hair O
dryer O
was O
not O
bad O
, O
it O
does O
what O
a O
hair O
dryer O
is O
suppose O
to O
do O
and O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
. O
It O
's O
very O
easy O
to O
use O
and O
with O
all O
the O
different O
settings O
and O
attachments O
, O
it O
's O
convenient O

blow O
dryer O
works O
magic O
on O
my O
hair O
. O
It O
straightens O
it O
so O
fast O
which O
really O
saves O
me O
on O
time O
. O
I O
have O
small O
hands O
so O
the O
way O
this O
dryer O
is O
shaped O
makes O
it O
easy O
to O
hold O
and O
use O
. O
It O
is O
n't O
very O
heavy O
which O
adds O
to O
its O
ease O
of O
use O
. O
Out O
of O
the O
three O
attachments O
, O
I O
use O
the O
big O
comb O
right O
after O
washing O
my O
hair O
and O
the O
small O
comb O
for O
touch O
ups O
. O
I O
would O
say O
without O
a O
good O
thermal O
balm O
, O
heat O
protectant O
, O
etc O
... O
It O
make O
be O
a O
little O
freezy O
. O
Since O
my O
hair O
is O
so O
curly O
, O
I O
am O
uses O
to O
using O
such O
products O
so O
if O
you O
do O
nt O
, O
you O
may O
want O
to O
. O
The O
heat O
dial O
only O
has O
3 O
ranges O
which O
I O
thought O
would O
be O
an O
issue O
. O
I O
would O
say O
medium O
is O
good O
for O
most O
people O
. O
I O
have O
never O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
not O
getting O
the O
right O
temperature O
for O
my O
needs O
. O
Overall O
, O
I O
am O
happy O
with O
my O
purchase O
. O
It O
does O
nt O
break O
the O
bank O
yet O
works O
better O
than O
any O
other O
blow O
dryer O
I O
have O
had O
. O
It O
saves O
me O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
because O
of O
how O
good O
of O
a O
job O
it O
does O
. O
I O
would O
consider O
this O
a O
must O
buy O
. O

Arrived O
when O
it O
was O
supposed O
to O
. O
Dries O
my O
hair O
super O
fast O
. O
Nice O
feel O
to O
the O
dryer O
. O
Great O
price O
. O
What O
more O
can O
you O
ask O
for O
? O

In O
the O
beginning O
things O
were O
fine O
, O
I O
just O
started O
using O
it O
  O
2weeks O
ago O
even O
though O
I O
bought O
it O
months O
ago O
. O
With O
2week(3 O
times O
a O
week O
) O
of O
use O
the O
thing O
has O
already O
died O
on O
me O
. O
This O
is O
not O
something O
, O
I O
would O
buy O
again O
. O
It O
did O
n't O
flat O
out O
die O
, O
it O
started O
declining O
in O
performance O
. O

Dries O
my O
hair O
fast O

I O
needed O
a O
new O
hair O
dryer O
as O
my O
girlfriend O
borrowed O
my O
BaByliss O
Pro O
TT O
. O
  O
The O
Remington O
works O
great O
. O
  O
Everything O
works O
as O
it O
should O
and O
it O
puts O
out O
a O
bunch O
of O
air O
and O
cools O
down O
quickly O
when O
you O
are O
through O
using O
it O
. O
  O
Easy O
to O
regulate O
the O
temperature O
and O
the O
unit O
has O
great O
fit O
and O
finish O
. O
  O
The O
one O
item O
worth O
noting O
is O
that O
the O
Remington O
is O
about O
a O
quarter O
pound O
heavier O
than O
the O
BaByliss O
which O
may O
be O
an O
issue O
if O
you O
use O
it O
for O
long O
periods O
of O
time O
. O
  O
I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O

Pretty O
design O
, O
however O
I O
did O
n't O
notice O
any O
difference O
in O
lack O
of O
frizz O
or O
shine O
that O
is O
associated O
with O
Ionic O
dryers O
. O

Very O
well O
made O
. O
Ergonomics O
is O
perfect O
. O
It O
has O
a O
dust O
filter O
that O
you O
can O
remove O
and O
clean O
out O
. O
The O
plug O
has O
a O
breaker O
switch O
. O
The O
main O
power O
switch O
is O
in O
the O
handle O
. O
This O
dryer O
can O
be O
used O
in O
a O
salon O
setting O
. O

Just O
pyrchased O
this O
, O
but O
it O
works O
well O
. O
  O
Low O
is O
hot O
enough O
for O
thin O
hair O
. O
  O
Med O
is O
hor O
and O
Hot O
is O
super O
hot O
! O
  O
My O
old O
dryer O
similar O
to O
this O
lasted O
years O
. O
  O
We O
'll O
see O
about O
this O
one O
. O

Great O

Love O
the O
diverse O
settings O
! O
Does O
a O
great O
job O
of O
drying O
my O
thick O
hair O
quicker O
than O
other O
dryers O
I O
have O
tried O
. O

I O
am O
extremely O
happy O
that O
I O
purchased O
this O
hair O
dryer O
! O
  O
I O
have O
lots O
of O
fine O
hair O
and O
it O
dries O
my O
hair O
in O
about O
30 O
- O
35 O
minutes O
. O
  O
It O
does O
get O
pretty O
hot O
so O
I O
suggest O
a O
setting O
around O
50 O
– O
55 O
. O
  O
It O
’s O
very O
top O
heavy O
so O
heed O
the O
directions O
and O
secure O
it O
somehow O
. O
  O
I O
do O
have O
to O
say O
, O
the O
first O
thing O
my O
husband O
said O
when O
he O
saw O
it O
was O
“ O
are O
you O
going O
to O
the O
moon O
? O
” O
– O
as O
it O
does O
look O
like O
a O
space O
helmet O
. O
  O
The O
directions O
are O
not O
very O
clear O
but O
I O
managed O
to O
put O
it O
together O
just O
fine O
by O
myself O
and O
it O
’s O
very O
sturdy O
. O
  O
I O
definitely O
would O
recommend O
this O
dryer O
. O

Dries O
my O
extremely O
thick O
, O
long O
hair O
quickly O
. O
  O
I O
use O
leave O
- O
in O
conditioner O
, O
brush O
out O
with O
my O
Wet O
Brush O
and O
then O
use O
the O
comb O
attachment O
to O
dry O
. O
  O
It O
takes O
& O
# O
60;10 O
min O
. O
  O
This O
is O
unheard O
of O
for O
me O
. O
  O
Its O
also O
fairly O
quiet O
. O
  O
My O
friends O
are O
sick O
or O
hearing O
about O
it O
so O
, O
I O
thought O
I O
'd O
tell O
Amazonians O
... O
I O
really O
love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
! O

This O
is O
a O
good O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
It O
's O
the O
4th O
one O
that O
I O
've O
bought O
over O
several O
years O
. O

Excellent O
. O
Small O
. O
No O
negatives O
. O

I O
love O
that O
this O
comes O
with O
a O
little O
diffuser O
. O
For O
a O
little O
guy O
, O
it O
does O
a O
very O
good O
job O
. O

exec O

The O
hair O
dryer O
is O
soooo O
light O
and O
can O
dry O
my O
medium O
to O
heavy O
hair O
in O
about O
5 O
minutes O
. O
  O
The O
only O
negative O
is O
that O
it O
is O
kind O
of O
large O
and O
difficult O
to O
store O
, O
but O
besides O
that O
, O
I O
'd O
definitely O
recommend O
it O
! O

Second O
one O
i O
purchased O
for O
wife O
and O
daughter O

good O
settings O
nice O
flow O
real O
smooth O

Very O
compact O
, O
easy O
for O
travel O
packing O
, O
and O
works O
very O
well O
. O
For O
such O
  O
a O
small O
dryer O
, O
it O
packs O
a O
lot O
of O
power O
, O
and O
barely O
takes O
much O
longer O
than O
my O
full O
size O
dryer O
, O
to O
to O
it O
's O
job O
. O
Folds O
, O
and O
takes O
up O
1/3 O
the O
space O
though O
, O
and O
comes O
with O
a O
cute O
case O
, O
and O
2 O
attachments O

Great O
dryer O
except O
that O
the O
retractable O
cord O
stops O
completely O
retracting O
. O
  O
I O
replaced O
the O
first O
one O
under O
warranty O
after O
about O
9 O
months O
. O
  O
Within O
about O
another O
9 O
months O
the O
second O
dryer O
's O
retractable O
cord O
would O
not O
retract O
completely O
. O
  O
I O
followed O
the O
directions O
as O
to O
how O
to O
retract O
the O
cord O
. O
  O
The O
warranty O
only O
covers O
12 O
months O
from O
original O
purchase O
date O
so O
I O
am O
now O
out O
of O
luck O
as O
far O
as O
getting O
a O
new O
one O
. O

Better O
than O
any O
hair O
dryer O
I O
have O
had O
. O
Great O
product O
. O

It O
has O
several O
heat O
settings O
and O
several O
speeds O
. O
  O
The O
options O
are O
great O
! O

Works O
great O
. O

I O
read O
all O
the O
great O
reviews O
and O
decided O
to O
give O
it O
a O
try O
. O
I O
was O
a O
little O
disappointed O
. O
It O
takes O
a O
little O
longer O
to O
dry O
instead O
of O
the O
faster O
way O
the O
review O
mentioned O
. O
It O
is O
also O
not O
as O
hot O
as O
my O
regular O
cheaper O
blower O
. O

Works O
like O
it O
should O
. O

Looks O
great O
, O
works O
great O
, O
cord O
is O
n't O
too O
short O
( O
a O
pet O
peeve O
) O
, O
and O
I O
love O
that O
it O
has O
more O
than O
2 O
settings O
like O
many O
dryers O
these O
days O
. O
I O
can O
even O
give O
my O
dogs O
a O
little O
help O
drying O
off O
in O
the O
winter O
since O
I O
can O
change O
up O
the O
settings O
the O
moment O
it O
's O
a O
bit O
too O
hot O
or O
cool O
without O
going O
too O
far O
the O
opposite O
direction O
. O
Really O
