First O
Amazon O
Review O
... O
So O
I O
bought O
this O
hair O
dryer O
as O
my O
main O
hairdryer O
at O
home O
. O
I O
typically O
use O
the O
WARM O
setting O
. O
Overall O
, O
great O
finish O
and O
works O
very O
well O
. O
Despite O
me O
using O
the O
warm O
( O
not O
hot O
) O
setting O
, O
the O
thin O
film O
of O
plastic O
over O
the O
barrel O
and O
handle O
slowly O
started O
to O
peel O
off O
. O
Not O
a O
big O
deal O
, O
but O
definitely O
worth O
noting O
, O
in O
case O
that O
bothers O
you O
. O
It O
's O
does O
n't O
look O
so O
pretty O
now O
, O
and O
I O
've O
had O
it O
for O
about O
a O
year O
. O
Overall O
, O
great O
value O
for O
the O
money O
and O
excellent O
results O
, O
but O
the O
packaging O
I O
'd O
give O
a O
4/10 O
, O
they O
could O
have O
done O
better O
. O

My O
Revlon O
hair O
dryer O
started O
sparking O
and O
died O
in O
January O
, O
a O
few O
days O
after O
the O
one O
- O
year O
warranty O
expired O
( O
yay O
! O
not O
. O
) O
so O
I O
needed O
to O
find O
a O
quick O
replacement O
. O
I O
've O
been O
pleasantly O
surprised O
with O
this O
dryer O
so O
far O
! O
I O
have O
very O
thick O
hair O
that O
usually O
takes O
forever O
to O
dry O
, O
even O
with O
a O
dryer O
, O
but O
this O
one O
is O
nice O
and O
light O
and O
does O
n't O
make O
my O
arm O
feel O
like O
it O
's O
going O
to O
snap O
off O
after O
holding O
it O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
. O
Probably O
the O
smartest O
part O
of O
the O
design O
is O
the O
honeycomb O
pattern O
over O
the O
back O
-- O
it O
's O
pretty O
much O
impossible O
for O
my O
hair O
to O
get O
through O
it O
and O
get O
stuck O
in O
the O
blades O
. O
That O
makes O
drying O
much O
easier O
, O
since O
I O
can O
move O
the O
dryer O
through O
my O
hair O
without O
worrying O
about O
sudden O
- O
onset O
baldness O
and O
pain O
. O
It O
's O
not O
too O
loud O
, O
and O
it O
's O
definitely O
quieter O
than O
my O
old O
dryer O
. O
My O
only O
minor O
complaint O
is O
that O
the O
nozzle O
( O
is O
that O
what O
it O
's O
called O
? O
the O
duckbill O
- O
looking O
thing O
that O
concentrates O
air O
) O
will O
occasionally O
fly O
off O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
drying O
. O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
if O
that O
's O
force O
from O
the O
air O
, O
or O
from O
moving O
the O
dryer O
around O
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O
quite O
as O
secure O
as O
it O
could O
be O
. O
Other O
than O
that O
, O
I O
'm O
completely O
satisfied O
with O
this O
dryer O
-- O
and O
the O
fun O
color O
is O
a O
plus O
, O
too O
! O

It O
is O
beautiful O
, O
I O
ordered O
a O
white O
one O
, O
I O
really O
like O
this O
color O
! O
  O
The O
size O
is O
good O
and O
it O
has O
really O
nice O
design O
. O
I O
got O
it O
on O
time O
. O
I O
love O
it O
so O
much O
. O
It O
is O
easy O
to O
take O
! O

I O
have O
long O
thick O
hair O
and O
it O
usually O
takes O
a O
long O
time O
to O
blow O
dry O
. O
Not O
with O
this O
dryer O
! O
It O
is O
the O
best O
one O
I O
ever O
had O
. O
I O
could O
not O
believe O
the O
price O
was O
so O
good O
. O
Love O
It O
! O

Great O
buy O
for O
great O
price O
. O

It O
works O
well O
. O
Makes O
my O
hair O
curly O
and O
dries O
it O
quickly O
. O
It O
makes O
me O
a O
little O
nervous O
bc O
I O
have O
long O
hair O
and O
I O
am O
scared O
that O
it O
will O
get O
sucked O
into O
the O
backside O
of O
the O
dryer O
. O

Strong O
and O
powerful O
, O
however O
, O
it O
's O
a O
little O
too O
powerful O
for O
me O
. O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
light O
dryer O
and O
this O
one O
works O
, O
it O
's O
not O
super O
light O
but O
it O
's O
also O
not O
too O
heavy O
and O
I O
did O
nt O
want O
to O
go O
through O
the O
hassle O
of O
returning O
. O

Pretty O
good O
, O
not O
any O
better O
than O
other O
hair O
dryers O
in O
that O
price O
range O
. O

Love O
this O
product O
. O
Nifty O
compact O
is O
a O
plus O
. O
Can O
be O
taken O

Use O
to O
steam O
or O
dry O
hair O
. O

Bought O

that O
the O
wall O
mount O

with O
a O
customized O

the O
absolute O
perfect O
desired O
look O
. O
I O
am O
a O
licensed O
cosmetologist O
and O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
from O
experience O
that O
this O
hair O
dryer O
is O
professional O
quality O
and O
is O
exactly O
what O
I O
would O
use O
in O
my O
home O
salon O
. O
It O
is O
adjustable O

three O

two O

Styling O

an O
art O
and O
a O
Stylist O
is O
only O
as O
good O
as O
her O
tools O
. O
This O
dryer O
is O
a O
top O
of O
the O
line O
styling O
tool O
which O
means O
it O
saves O
me O
time O
and O
energy O
while O
I O
am O
styling O
and O
I O
get O

almost O
instantly O
. O
Say O
goodbye O
to O
frizz O
with O
this O
iconic O
hair O
dryer O
because O
it O
's O
designed O
to O
emit O
powerful O
negative O
ions O
to O
seal O
and O
smooth O
the O
hair O
's O

it O
increases O
my O
hair O
's O
own O
natural O
shine O
while O
providing O
me O
with O
healthy O
and O
hydrated O
hair O

The O
Xtava O
Rimini O
1800W O
Hair O
Dryer O
has O
totally O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
. O
Disclaimer O
: O
I O
received O
the O
Allure O
Hair O
Dryer O
during O
a O
promotion O
in O
exchange O
I O
would O
tell O
you O
what O
I O
thought O
about O
the O
Allure O
in O
this O
review O
. O
All O
statements O
made O
are O
solely O
my O
own O
and O
are O
based O
on O
my O
own O
personal O
experience O
while O
using O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
That O
being O
said O
, O
I O
would O
absolutely O
recommend O
this O
hair O
dryer O
to O
persons O
of O
all O
ages O
, O
it O
works O
better O
than O
great O
! O

Its O
a O
blow O
dryer O
! O
LOL O
. O
I O
docked O
a O
star O
because O
it O
has O
a O
weaker O
output O
than O
my O
old O
blow O
dryer O
. O
  O
I O
appreciate O
the O
cold O
setting O
. O

Good O
product O
. O
Did O
not O
have O
problems O
so O
far O
and O
work O
as O
expected O
. O

I O
initially O
bought O
this O
for O
a O
vacation O
. O
Within O
a O
few O
days O
it O
would O
only O
blow O
cool O
air O
. O
Contacted O
Amazon O
who O
had O
Helen O
of O
Troy O
email O
me O
. O
They O
replaced O
it O
no O
questions O
asked O
and O
I O
did O
n't O
even O
have O
to O
send O
the O
new O
defective O
one O
back O
! O
But O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
this O
I O
LOVE O
! O
I O
use O
it O
every O
time O
I O
shower O
, O
not O
just O
for O
travel O
. O
It O
's O
smaller O
, O
but O
not O
on O
power O
, O
dries O
fast O
and O
the O
intake O
has O
n't O
collected O
any O
dust O
like O
other O
dryers O
do O
. O
Has O
a O
few O
different O
power O
settings O
. O
along O
with O
the O
cool O
setting O
and O
I O
would O
recommend O
this O
in O
a O
heartbeat O
. O

I O
was O
skeptical O
about O
purchasing O
this O
after O
reading O
several O
of O
the O
reviews O
, O
however O
, O
this O
blow O
dryer O
is O
AMAZING O
! O
  O
I O
have O
VERY O
thick O
, O
course O
, O
wavy O
, O
shoulder O
length O
hair O
. O
  O
With O
traditional O
Conair O
blow O
- O
dryers O
from O
Walmart O
, O
I O
would O
spend O
10 O
minutes O
blow O
drying O
my O
hair O
and O
it O
would O
be O
left O
really O
dry O
and O
frizzy O
. O
  O
I O
thought O
that O
was O
how O
all O
blow O
dryers O
would O
affect O
my O
hair O
. O
  O
Wrong O
. O
  O
With O
this O
dryer O
, O
it O
now O
takes O
me O
3 O
- O
4 O
minutes O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
and O
leaves O
it O
with O
a O
moisturized O
sheen O
. O
  O
I O
almost O
cried O
the O
first O
time O
I O
used O
it O
. O
  O
Yes O
, O
if O
you O
hold O
the O
handle O
too O
low O
you O
can O
accidentally O
press O
the O
buttons O
, O
however O
, O
to O
modify O
that O
I O
simply O
hold O
it O
higher O
up O
and O
have O
no O
problems O
. O
  O
When O
this O
one O
dies O

bc O
my O
old O
hands O

nt O
work O
as O

my O
hair O
faster O

smoother O
, O

the O
2 O

the O
heat O
exactly O
where O
you O
want O
it O
to O
go O
. O
  O

  O
Set O
it O
up O

that O
it O

Setting O
it O

a O
few O
months O
. O
  O
Now O
the O
same O
thing O
often O
happens O
and O
it O
makes O
lots O
of O
noise O
. O
  O
I O
think O
it O
will O
stop O
entirely O
very O
soon O
. O
  O
Tried O
cleaning O
the O
lint O
out O
several O
times O
. O
  O
The O
lint O
screen O
is O
buried O
under O
plastic O
strips O
making O
it O
difficult O
to O
clean O
. O

excellent O
good O

Great O
little O
travel O
dryer O
. O
Works O
almost O
as O
good O
as O
a O
full O
size O
one O
. O

Great O
little O
dryer O
and O
very O
reasonably O
priced O
! O
I O
bought O
this O
for O
my O
elderly O
mother O
. O
  O
Her O
hand O
held O
dryer O
had O
ceased O
working O
so O
this O
little O
dryer O
was O
the O
ticket O
! O
It O
is O
lightweight O
, O
small O
& O
easy O
to O
store O
, O
easy O
to O
use O
and O
it O
blows O
warm O
and O
cool O
air O
to O
dry O
my O
mother O
's O
hair O
! O
The O
most O
important O
part O
.... O
she O
likes O
it O
, O
so O
what O
's O
not O
to O
love O
! O

This O
is O
the O
second O
one O
we O
have O
mine O
is O
still O
going O
strong O
after O
two O
and O
a O
half O
years O
... O
and O
my O
daughters O
bombed O
out O
after O
2 O
months O
and O
we O
have O
to O
get O
it O
replaced O

You O
can O
tell O
right O
away O
this O
is O
a O
heavy O
duty O
hair O
dryer O
. O
I O
wanted O
something O
that O
had O
some O
power O
to O
it O
and O
could O
n't O
find O
it O
at O
my O
local O
Target O
. O
  O
This O
is O
a O
great O
product O
. O
I O
have O
been O
practicing O
blow O
outs O
and O
its O
prefect O
for O
this O
. O
  O
So O
as O
much O
as O
this O
is O
more O
pricey O
than O
a O
normal O
blow O
dryer O
it O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

It O
dries O
hair O
quickly O
and O
it O
's O
not O
to O
loud O
. O

First O
tried O
this O
at O
a O
Hyatt O
Hotel O
. O
Loved O
it O
and O
now O
I O
own O
my O
own O
. O
Great O
for O
travel O
or O
everyday O
use O
. O

I O
love O
it O
but O
... O
it O
's O
a O
little O
heavy O
! O

I O
had O
a O
really O
old O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
So O
this O
one O
to O
me O
is O
awesome O
! O
! O
  O
It O
's O
not O
too O
noisy O
and O
it O
dries O
my O
hair O
quickly O
. O

Seems O
to O
work O
just O
fine O
. O
Good O
price O
, O
no O
problems O
so O
far O
. O

Compact O
and O
conveniently O
portable O
. O
  O
Dryer O
is O
not O
very O
powerful O
, O
so O
the O
brush O
it O
pretty O
much O
useless O
for O
my O
hair O
. O
  O
Surprisingly O
this O
dryer O
is O
not O
even O
as O
powerful O
as O
my O
handheld O
blow O
dryer O
. O
  O
Bonnet O
works O
fine O
as O
long O
as O
you O
are O
satisfied O
with O
the O
low O
/ O
moderate O
heat O
. O

Love O
it O
! O
! O

It O
has O
plenty O
of O
power O
and O
dries O
well O
, O
but O
I O
had O
to O
return O
mine O
as O
it O
was O
so O
loud O
that O
it O
left O
my O
ears O
ringing O
. O

Perfect O
! O

best O
hairdryer O

I O
have O
had O
better O
, O
Not O
very O
hot O
. O

I O
LOVE O

  O
I O
went O
on O
vacation O
and O
there O
was O

. O
  O
I O
loved O
it O
so O
much O
I O
came O
home O
and O
searched O
for O
it O
til O
I O
found O
it O
. O
  O
Amazon O
had O
the O
best O
price O
for O
this O
model O
. O
  O
When O
it O
came O
, O
I O
was O
not O
disappointed O
. O
  O
If O
you O
like O
your O
dryer O
to O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
force O
to O
it O
, O
this O
is O
the O
one O

It O
is O
a O
great O
space O

well O
. O

Amazing O

frizz O
. O

Best O
hair O

ever O

Worked O
well O
and O
as O
described O
. O
  O
Motor O

like O

lighter O
and O
easier O
to O
work O
with O
when O
styling.dropped O
it O
accidentally O
and O
nothing O
was O
broken!drying O
seems O
enjoyable O

only O
used O

but O
am O
glad O

For O
the O

an O
  O
excellent O
buy O
. O
  O
I O

worry O
about O
having O
a O
bad O
hair O
day O
without O
a O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
simple O
and O
get O
the O
job O
done O
. O
  O
Either O
hot O
or O
cold O
. O
  O
Would O
be O
great O
if O
a O
third O
option O

hotter O
air O
. O

Does O

dryer O
itself O
works O
good O
, O
however O
i O
am O
already O
wrapping O
duct O
tape O
around O
the O
twist O
mechanism O
that O
allows O
the O
stand O
to O
go O
up O
and O
down O
.... O
its O
cracked O
, O
first O
day O
of O
use O
, O
I O

send O
it O

but O
I O
need O
the O
dryer O
now O

Works O
well O
, O
I O
wish O
this O
could O
be O
much O
smaller O

Works O
very O
nice O
on O
both O
voltages O

Does O

Bought O

my O

and O
she O
recently O
took O
it O
on O
a O
trip O
and O
loved O
it O
. O
Powerful O
enough O
, O
not O
too O
noisy O
, O
takes O
up O
little O
space O
. O
It O
does O
exactly O
what O
you O
want O
from O
a O
travel O
dryer O
. O

it O
is O
good O
drying O
tool O
. O
I O
expected O
it O
to O
be O
a O
bit O
better O
from O
reading O
reviews O
. O
It O
does O
the O
job O
as O
drying O
hair O
and O
it O
is O
good O
quality O
and O
well O
made O
hair O
dryer O
. O
I O
recommend O
. O

Loved O

just O
quit O
. O
Reset O
button O
wo O
n't O
fix O
it O
. O
Very O
disappointed O
as O
I O
had O
a O
much O
cheaper O
hairdryer O
and O
it O
lasted O
years O
. O
This O
has O
only O
lasted O
3 O
months O
! O

Excellent O

Although O
the O
package O
was O
damaged O
on O
arrival O
the O
contents O
were O
intact O
. O
  O
This O
was O
replacement O
for O
an O
identical O
Conair O
unit O
that O
my O
Bride O
has O
used O
continually O
for O
several O
years O
. O
  O
We O
expect O
the O
new O
Conair O
to O
be O
as O
serviceable O
as O
the O
previous O
one O
. O

This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
wonderful O
! O

Fantastic O
bonnet O
drier O
. O
Definitely O
worth O
paying O
a O
little O
extra O
to O
get O
a O
quality O
product O
. O
I O
primarily O
use O
this O
when O
I O
am O
doing O
a O
deep O
treatment O
on O
my O
hair O
. O

Only O
used O

travel O
bag O

  O
It O
does O

this O
hair O
dryer O
! O
  O
The O
power O
it O
delivers O
is O
perfect O
and O
it O
seems O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
in O
half O
the O
time O
of O
my O
old O
one O
. O
The O
speed O
and O
heat O
buttons O
are O
' O
user O
friendly O
' O
and O
the O
heavy O
cord O
is O
nice O
and O
long O
. O
Altho O
it O
's O
not O
quite O
as O
light O
as O
I O
'd O
imagined O
and O
maybe O
even O
a O
little O
bigger O
than O
my O
old O
one O
, O
I O
would O
n't O
consider O
it O
to O
be O
heavy O
or O
bulky O
and O
it O
's O
still O
quiet O
and O
powerful O
. O
  O
Good O
value O
for O
the O
money O
. O

Great O
dryer O
, O
I O
use O
it O
to O
deep O
conditioner O
my O
hair O
. O
  O
I O
love O
the O
portability O
of O
this O
product O
. O
  O
This O

a O
lot O
better O
than O
the O
bulky O
hooded O
dryer O
. O

love O
this O
dryer O
, O
, O
it O
is O
my O
second O
one O
, O
but O
wish O
it O
lasted O
longer- O
first O
one O
was O
less O
than O
2 O
yrs O

This O
was O
delivered O
well O
within O
the O
promised O
window O
even O
though O
we O
were O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
one O
of O
the O
worst O
weather O
weeks O
this O
winter O
so O
far O
. O
  O
When O
I O
used O
the O
dryer O
I O
was O
even O
more O
pleased O
because O
my O
hair O
felt O
sooooo O
soft O
and O
was O
so O
shiny O
. O
Even O
my O
hubby O
thought O
my O
hair O
felt O
softer O
. O
  O
You O
ladies O
are O
doing O
great O
work O
and O
I O
thank O
Amazon O
for O
carrying O
your O
line O
of O
products O
. O

Excellent O
product O
and O
it O
is O
exactly O
as O
described O
by O
the O
seller O
! O

I O
absolutely O
love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
With O
long O
thick O
hair O
I O
'd O
gotten O
used O
to O
spending O
15 O
- O
20 O
minutes O
just O
drying O
my O
hair O
enough O
to O
allow O
me O
to O
style O
it O
. O
This O
dryer O
is O
not O
only O
lightweight O
and O
quieter O
than O
any O
dryer O
I O
've O
ever O
had O
but O
it O
also O
dries O
my O
hair O
in O
5 O
- O
6 O
min O
. O
That O
's O
from O
dripping O
just O
out O
of O
the O
shower O
wet O
to O
nearly O
bone O
dry O
in O
less O
than O
half O
the O
time O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
even O
need O
to O
use O
the O
highest O
heat O
settings O
so O
my O
frizz O
is O
much O
more O
contained O
. O
With O
myself O
and O
two O
thick O
haired O
daughters O
using O
it O
a O
fast O
dryer O
is O
a O
must O
. O
So O
excited O
to O
finally O
have O
found O
something O
that O
actually O
is O
a O
good O
as O
it O
claims O
to O
be O
. O

it O
does O
nt O
damage O
the O
hair O
like O
the O
other O
dryers O
i O
ve O
tried O
and O
its O
very O
lightweight O

does O
the O
job O
right O

I O
've O
been O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
so O
far O
. O
  O
It O
's O
very O
light O
, O
and O
I O
love O
that O
it O
has O
three O
heat O
( O
one O
being O
no O
heat O
) O
settings O
and O
two O
speed O
settings O
, O
which O
is O
more O
than O
most O
dryers O
have O
. O
  O
The O
airflow O
is O
pretty O
strong O
on O
the O
high O
setting O
. O
  O
The O
setting O
labels O
are O
already O
wearing O
off O
though O
, O
after O
only O
a O
few O
months O
of O
regular O
use O
. O

I O
already O
had O
this O
hairdryer O
so O
it O
was O
just O
a O
replacement O

if O
I O
'm O
sitting O

.. O
Basically O
, O
I O
love O
it O
and O
I O
'm O
SO O
GLAD O
i O
did O
n't O
waste O
my O
money O
on O
a O
Pibb O
or O
PEBCO O
brand O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
own O
a O
salon O
, O
but O
it O
's O
great O
for O
home O
use O
and O
is O
a O
million O
times O
better O
than O
standing O
in O
front O
of O
my O
mirror O
trying O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
with O
a O
handheld O

. O

! O

best O
blowdryer O

Love O

Great O
used O
this O
for O
my O
aunts O
salon O
, O
cheap O
but O
works O
like O
its O
an O
expensive O
dyer O

I O
have O
thin O
fine O
hair O
and O
it O
is O
gentle O
enough O
on O
my O
hair O
and O
gives O
me O
the O
volume O
I O
need O
. O
Thank O
you O
. O

I O
love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
It O
is O
so O
easy O
to O
use O
. O
  O
And O
I O
really O
like O
that O
the O
cord O
is O
extra O
long O
to O
reach O
an O
outlet O
in O
another O
room O
. O
  O
Does O
a O
great O
job O
on O
my O
hair O
which O
has O
become O
dryer O
due O
to O
aging O
. O
  O
Great O
for O
all O
seniors O
! O
! O

This O
is O
a O
very O
nice O
, O
professional O
looking O
hairdryer O
. O
Nice O
color O
and O
the O
design O
is O
very O
sleek O
and O
sharp O
looking O
. O
Looks O
like O
it O
's O
worth O
a O
lot O
more O
than O
what O
it O
really O
cost O
. O
It O
comes O
in O
a O
nice O
box O
, O
so O
it O
's O
very O
suitable O
for O
gifting O
. O
The O
description O
says O
it O
's O
ultra O
lightweight O
but O
, O
for O
me O
, O
it O
felt O
like O
it O
weighed O
just O
as O
much O
as O
any O
other O
hairdryer O
. O
I O
like O
that O
it O
has O
2 O
speeds O
and O
3 O
heat O
settings O
. O
I O
have O
very O
fine O
hair O
, O
so O
how O
much O
heat O
I O
use O
on O
my O
hair O
makes O
a O
big O
difference O
. O
The O
hottest O
setting O
does O
seem O
to O
get O
very O
hot O
, O
so O
be O
careful O
. O
Also O
with O
my O
fine O
hair O
, O
the O
higher O
settings O
had O
a O
tendency O
to O
tangle O
my O
fine O
hair O
, O
so O
I O
had O
to O
usually O
use O
the O
medium O
heat O
setting O
, O
which O
worked O
well O
. O
The O
hairdryer O
itself O
was O
not O
loud O
and O
dried O
my O
hair O
quickly O
. O
It O
has O
a O
long O
cord O
and O
comes O
with O
a O
concentrator O
nozzle O
which O
really O
help O
to O
reduce O
frizz O
. O
The O
concentrator O
nozzle O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
remove O
and O
put O
back O
on O
when O
needed O
. O
I O
also O
like O
that O
this O
hairdryer O
had O
a O
removable O
filter O
, O
it O
was O
easy O
to O
twist O
off O
for O
cleaning O
. O
Overall O
, O
it O
's O
powerful O
and O
does O
a O
nice O
job O
. O
I O
loved O
the O
look O
and O
it O
's O
easy O
to O
hold O
and O
use O
. O
Hoping O
it O
will O
last O
awhile O
. O
Would O
definitely O
recommend O
. O
Disclosure O
: O
I O

The O
opinions O
are O
my O
own O
and O
based O
on O
my O
personal O
experience O
with O
the O

I O
received O
one O

more O
of O
the O

above O
for O
free O
for O
my O
unbiased O
and O
honest O
opinion O
. O

This O
product O
had O
great O
reviews O
, O
so O
I O
thought O
I O
'd O
give O
it O
a O
try O
. O
Turns O
out O
it O
's O
the O
BEST O
blowdryer O
! O
It O
's O
lightweight O
and O
dries O
in O
a O
very O
short O
amount O
of O
time O
. O

I O
can O
not O
express O
how O
much O
I O
love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
! O
It O
's O
small O
and O
sleek O
. O
It O
gives O
me O
the O
hair O
I O
want O
to O
have O
, O
that O
look O
that O
I O
was O
always O
jealous O
of O
others O
having O
. O
I O
no O
longer O
look O
like O
a O
big O
frizz O
ball O
! O
I O
did O
n't O
know O
that O
hair O
could O
look O
this O
good O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
thankful O
for O
the O
opportunity O
to O
test O
this O
product O
complimentary O
and O
give O
my O
experiences O
and O
feedback O
. O
I O
love O
all O
the O
features O
of O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
The O
cooling O
feature O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
feature O
along O
with O
the O
nozzles O
. O
I O
use O
to O
let O
my O
hair O
air O
dry O
and O
it O
took O
so O
long O
to O
dry O
being O
my O
hair O
is O
so O
long O
. O
This O
hair O
dryer O
took O
about O
10 O
- O
15 O
minutes O
. O
I O
did O
n't O
get O
tangled O
hair O
that O
hurt O
brushing O
out O
like O
I O
did O
with O
other O
hair O
dryers O
. O
This O
is O
the O
best O
dryer O
! O

I O
can O
see O
why O
other O
reviewers O
found O
the O
parts O
to O
be O
flimsy O
and O
plastic O
. O
  O
It O
could O
very O
easily O
break O
and O
be O
unrepairable O
. O
  O
But O
the O
heat O
is O
steady O
and O
well O
distributed O
. O
  O
The O
cooler O
setting O
does O
not O
burn O
my O
scalp O
and O
the O
hotter O
setting O
is O
great O
for O
a O
quick O
blast O
to O
get O
drying O
started O
on O
my O
long O
hair O
. O
  O
I O
will O
say O
to O
be O
very O
careful O
with O
the O
plastic O
parts O
and O
it O
should O
be O
fine O
. O

good O
job O

exelente O

good O
hair O
dryer O
works O
well O

My O
old O
( O
Revlon O
) O
hair O
dryer O
went O
kaput O
, O
and O
I O
went O
to O
a O
local O
store O
and O
bought O
another O
Revlon O
to O
replace O
it O
. O
  O
Yikes O
! O
  O
While O
it O
did O
dry O
my O
very O
straight O
, O
fine O
hair O
quickly O
, O
the O
air O
flow O
was O
so O
strong O
that O
when O
I O
put O
my O
hair O
in O
velcro O
curlers O
, O
the O
Revlon O
hair O
dryer O
blew O
the O
curlers O
out O
of O
my O
hair O
! O
  O
So O
I O
went O
looking O
on O
my O
beloved O
Amazon O
to O
find O
a O
better O
hair O
dryer O
with O
lots O
of O
positive O
reviews O
, O
and O
ended O
up O
ordering O
this O
for O
about O
the O
same O
price O
I O
paid O
for O
the O
Revlon O
one O
. O
  O
This O
one O
is O
great O
-- O
so O
much O
more O
substantial O
and O
quality O
feeling O
and O
noticeably O
quieter O
and O
less O
shrill O
sounding O
than O
the O
Revlon O
. O
My O
single O
complaint O
is O
that O
the O
toggle O
switches O
on O
the O
handle O
that O
control O
the O
air O
flow O
and O
heat O
settings O
are O
a O
little O
too O
easy O
to O
accidentally O
change O
when O
drying O
your O
hair O
. O
  O
But O
I O
still O
like O
this O
hair O
dryer O
a O
lot O
. O

good O
product O
all O
well O

Great O
hair O

been O
using O
them O
for O
years O

  O
Nice O
wall O
hung O
means O
out O
of O
the O
way O
not O
laying O
on O
the O
counter O
or O
having O
to O
unplug O
and O
put O
away O
each O
time O
it O
is O
used O
. O
  O
My O
last O
one O
lasted O
about O
5 O
years O
. O
  O
Bought O
two O
more O
. O

Wind O
is O
strong O
and O
does O
not O
feel O
too O
hot O
. O
Get O
hairs O
dry O
quickly O
. O
Love O
this O
product O
. O

Love O
this O
. O
  O
I O
dropped O
my O
previous O
one O
, O
different O
brand O
, O
and O
had O
to O
replace O
it O
. O
  O
The O
cord O
- O
keeper O
part O
is O
the O
main O
feature O
for O
me O
. O
  O
The O
hair O
dryer O
itself O
works O
fine O
, O
a O
little O
louder O
than O
most O
but O
is O
also O
more O
lightweight O
than O
most O
. O
  O
Love O
it O
! O

it O
an O
excelent O
  O
product O

It O
drys O
my O
hair O
, O
does O
what O
it O
's O
supposed O
to O
, O
pretty O
much O
says O
it O
all O
. O
If O
it O
's O
alive O
a O
few O
years O
from O
now O
I O
'll O
be O
impressed O

it O
's O
not O
very O
powerfull O
but O
it O
woks O
properly O

I O
bought O
it O
for O
my O
maine O
coon O
cat O
. O
He O
likes O
this O
dryer O
. O

Great O
! O
! O
! O

good O

I O
love O
how O
lightweight O
, O
fast O
and O
VERY O
quiet O
this O
hairdryer O
is O
. O
The O
reason O
I O
dropped O
it O
to O
four O
stars O
is O
because O
it O
has O
a O
tendency O
to O
tangle O
my O
fine O
( O
not O
thin O
) O
hair O
, O
but O
the O
pros O
definitely O
outweigh O
the O
one O
con O
. O
Fine O
- O
haired O
women O
just O
need O
to O
be O
careful O
about O
pointing O
the O
dryer O
down O
the O
hair O
shaft O
to O
keep O
the O
tangles O
at O
bay O
. O

No O
better O
than O
less O
expensive O
hair O
dryers O
I O
have O
owned O
. O
  O
Died O
after O
about O
6 O
months O
. O

This O
is O
the O
best O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
It O
is O
my O
second O
one O
. O
  O
I O
had O
the O
first O
one O
for O
years O
and O
when O
it O
finally O
broke O
, O
I O
tried O
a O
few O
other O
blow O
dryers O
but O
returned O
them O
all O
and O
went O
right O
back O
to O
the O
Conair O
1875 O
. O
  O
The O
cord O
keeper O
is O
a O
great O
feature O
for O
me O
, O
since O
I O
keep O
the O
dyer O
in O
a O
drawer O
. O
  O
It O
stays O
in O
there O
compactly O
. O

Use O
it O
every O
time O
I O
wash O
my O
hair O
. O
Pretty O
good O
. O
It O
's O
been O
a O
while O
, O
works O
without O
problem O
. O

It O
's O
good O
, O
just O
what O
I O
wanted O
. O

This O
was O
installed O
in O
a O
RV O
on O
the O
wall O
of O
the O
bathroom O
area O
. O
The O
unit O
is O
plugged O
into O
a O
110 O
volt O
GFCI O
outlet O
and O
the O
night O
light O
and O
unit O
power O
can O
be O
turned O
on O
/ O
off O
by O
pressing O
the O
GFCI O
button O
. O
The O
night O
light O
is O
good O
- O
not O
too O
bright O
but O
ample O
. O
The O
unit O
appears O
to O
offer O
good O
air O
flow O
and O
not O
being O
too O
noisy O
. O
I O
am O
happy O
with O
the O
performance O
, O
looks O
and O
operation O
so O
far O
. O

My O
daughter O
loves O
the O
color O
pink O
so O
I O
had O
to O
get O
it O
. O
Simple O
speeds O
as O
a O
standard O
hair O
dryer O
. O

Great O
for O
my O
Natural O
hair O
. O
Has O
proven O
to O
be O
sturdy O
& O
saves O
me O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
in O
the O
washing O
process O
. O

Love O
it O
. O
Does O
a O
good O
. O
Hot O
enough O
. O
Diffuser O
is O
a O
bonus O
. O

Just O
started O
using O
  O

Works O
very O
well O
. O
A O
little O
hard O
to O
mount O
on O
the O

are O
needed O

Good O
quality O
. O
Very O
pretty O
. O
Powerful O
. O
Only O
complaint O
is O
its O
kinda O
heavy O
so O
after O
a O
while O
it O
kinda O
hurts O
my O
hand O
. O
But O
I O
guess O
it O
's O
not O
really O
a O
problem O
since O
it O
dries O
my O
hair O
pretty O
quick O
. O

i O
love O
it O

Amazing O
product O
works O
great O
for O
naturally O
curly O
hair O
! O

It O
really O
does O
what O
it O
says O
-- O
it O
effectively O
smoothes O
hair O
and O
significantly O
helps O
reduce O
frizz O
. O

I O
love O
this O
blow O
drier O
. O
Cut O
my O
blow O
dry O
time O
in O
half O
. O
I O
bought O
the O
leopard O
/ O
cheetah O
print O
one O
. O
The O
price O
on O
this O
item O
has O
changed O
significantly O
, O
unfortunately O
. O
When O
I O
purchased O
, O
this O
dryer O
was O
significantly O
less O
expensive O
than O
other O
colors O
of O
the O
same O
model O
. O
Before O
ordering O
and O
receiving O
I O
was O
concerned O
it O
was O
a O
knock O
off O
because O
it O
was O
cheaper O
than O
the O
other O
two O
color O
options O
. O
I O
do O
think O
it O
is O
real O
. O
It O
works O
well O
. O
Feels O
well O
made O
. O
I O
looked O
at O
all O
of O
the O
instructions O
closely O
on O
the O
box O
for O
spelling O
/ O
grammar O
mistakes O
which O
are O
common O
with O
fakes O
and O
found O
none O
. O
I O
've O
had O
about O
2 O
months O
now O
and O
it O
works O
well O
. O
I O
also O
had O
one O
of O
my O
good O
friends O
look O
at O
it O
closely O
. O
She O
is O
a O
cosmetologist O
and O
currently O
works O
at O
a O
salon O
that O
sells O
this O
brand O
. O
She O
said O
it O
looked O
authentic O
to O
her O
. O

I O
have O
used O
other O
hair O
dryers O
from O
Xtava O
, O
and O
this O
one O
is O
by O
far O
my O
favorite O
. O
The O
other O
one O
was O
great O
for O
quickly O
drying O
my O
hair O
, O
but O
it O
left O
my O
ends O
feeling O
really O
dried O
out O
. O
This O
one O
takes O
a O
little O
longer O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
, O
but O
it O
leaves O
my O
hair O
feeling O
so O
soft O
and O
not O
damaged O
at O
all O
. O
This O
dryer O
is O
very O
easy O
and O
pretty O
straight O
forward O
to O
use O
. O
There O
are O
three O
heat O
settings O
on O
the O
heat O
switch O
, O
three O
speed O
settings O
on O
the O
speed O
switch O
, O
and O
a O
cool O
shot O
air O
button O
. O
On O
the O
heat O
switch O
you O
will O
find O
low O
, O
medium O
, O
and O
high O
temperatures O
. O
On O
the O
speed O
switch O
you O
will O
find O
off O
, O
gentle O
, O
and O
strong O
. O
The O
cool O
shot O
button O
is O
used O
to O
set O
your O
style O
. O
I O
like O
to O
use O
this O
dryer O
on O
him O
heat O
and O
strong O
speed O
. O
I O
use O
a O
round O
brush O
to O
style O
my O
hair O
, O
then O
the O
cool O
shot O
to O
set O
. O
The O
dryer O
comes O
with O
two O
attachments O
, O
a O
concentrated O
and O
a O
diffuser O
. O
The O
diffuser O
is O
great O
for O
those O
with O
curly O
hair O
who O
want O
to O
reduce O
frizz O
. O
The O
connector O
is O
great O
for O
people O
who O
have O
straight O
hair O
. O
It O
really O
helps O
me O
style O
my O
hair O
straighter O
, O
without O
needing O
a O
straightener O
. O
I O
really O
like O
how O
hight O
weight O
this O
dryer O
is O
. O
I O
have O
been O
having O
some O
weird O
back O
/ O
shoulder O
problems O
over O
the O
last O
couple O
years O
, O
so O
the O
lightweight O
hair O
dryer O
is O
something O
that O
I O
can O
really O
appreciate O
. O
I O
have O
small O
hands O
and O
I O
think O
that O
this O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
hold O
. O
The O
hair O
dryer O
is O
quite O
and O
while O
it O
might O
not O
have O
the O
power O
you O
are O
used O
to O
, O
it O
works O
great O
. O
I O
like O
that O
my O
hair O
appears O
to O
be O
far O
less O
damaged O
with O
this O
dryer O
than O
any O
other O
i O
have O
used O
, O
and O
it O
only O
takes O
a O
couple O
more O
minutes O
to O
dry O
. O
That O
is O
a O
tradeoff O
I O
am O
more O
than O
willing O
to O
make O
. O
This O
is O
the O
dryer O
I O
will O
continue O
to O
use O
on O
a O
day O
to O
day O
basis O
. O
Like O
others O
, O
I O
did O
receive O
this O
to O
review O
, O
what O
I O
have O
written O
is O
honest O
. O
I O
would O
not O
mislead O
consumers O
as O
I O
would O
not O
want O
to O
be O
mislead O
. O
This O
is O
a O
product O
that O
I O
stand O
by O
. O

This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
top O
quality O
and O
I O
love O
it O
. O
Dries O
my O
hair O
quickly O
, O
is O
light O
weight O
and O
works O
great O
. O
Has O
many O
adjustments O
for O
speed O
and O
heat O
plus O
cold O
blast O
. O
Best O
dryer O
I O
have O
ever O
owned O
so O
far O
. O

I O
really O
like O
the O
dryer O
and O
the O
price O
is O
n't O
to O
bad O
either O
. O
The O
only O
compliant O
I O
have O
are O
the O
switches O
are O
right O
where O
you O
hand O
/ O
fingers O
go O
and O
I O
keep O
flipping O
them O
when O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
too O
. O

Love O
it O
, O
has O
3 O
settings O
and O
cool O
, O
warm O
and O
hot O
for O
drying O
hair O
. O
Works O
very O
nice O
. O
And O
low O
, O
med O
and O
high O
also O
. O

This O
is O
a O
fabulous O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
It O
comes O
in O
a O
nice O
box O
and O
a O
nice O
color O
blue O
. O
  O
It O
is O
so O
light O
weight O
which O
makes O
it O
easy O
to O
dry O
my O
long O
hair O
. O
  O
Normally O
it O
takes O
a O
while O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
but O
with O
this O
hair O
dryer O
it O
probably O
cut O
the O
time O
in O
half O
. O
  O
It O
has O
a O
nice O
diffuser O
along O
with O
3 O
heat O
settings O
. O
  O
I O
like O
to O
start O
out O
on O
high O
, O
then O
a O
curling O
brush O
and O
low O
heat O
and O
finally O
cool O
to O
set O
my O
hair O
. O
  O
I O
love O
the O
cool O
shot O
to O
set O
it O
too O
. O
  O
My O
hair O
has O
less O
frizzies O
and O
looks O
a O
lot O
healthier O
since O
using O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
I O
am O
so O
glad O
I O
got O
to O
try O
it O
complimentary O
  O
for O
a O
honest O
and O
unbiased O
opinion O
. O

Excellent O
power O
with O
easy O
to O
use O

LOVE O
IT O
! O

love O
it O
! O

Arrived O
soooo O
fast O
made O
me O
very O
happy O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
and O
the O
dryer O
it O
self O
is O
fantastic O
. O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
hair O
dryer O
I O
really O
like O
the O
color O
to O
it O
. O
It O
looks O
fabulous O
. O
The O
hair O
dryer O
it O
self O
is O
light O
weight O
. O
I O
like O
to O
use O
it O
without O
the O
attachment O
because O
usually O
it O
works O
faster O
than O
with O
it O
but O
that O
is O
just O
because O
I O
have O
long O
hair O
that O
has O
tangling O
issues O
. O
The O
hair O
dryer O
gets O
hot O
enough O
to O
dry O
your O
hair O
fast O
and O
it O
will O
look O
great O
. O
It O
has O
a O
nice O
long O
cord O
to O
it O
that O
does O
n't O
get O
tangled O
up O
either O
. O
I O
received O
this O
as O
a O
gift O
to O
share O
my O
experiences O
while O
using O
this O
product O
. O

Love O
it O
. O
Recieved O
it O
quickly O
. O
Dries O
really O
fast O
. O
Only O
down O
side O
is O
that O
it O
vibrates O
leaving O
my O
hand O
tingly O
. O
But O
its O
awesome O
. O

Quiet O
yet O
efficient O
. O

Just O
received O
my O
new O
blow O
dryer O
in O
the O
mail O
. O
  O
When O
I O
opened O
it O
, O
it O
was O
damaged O
, O
very O
disappointed O
. O

I O
've O
only O
been O
using O
this O
dryer O
for O
a O
week O
but O
like O
it O
. O
It O
is O
powerful O
and O
does O
a O
nice O
job O
. O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
how O
long O
it O
is O
going O
to O
last O
however O
. O
But O
for O
the O
price O
, O
I O
'm O
pleased O
. O

The O
only O
con O
is O
the O
weight O
. O
It O
's O
pretty O
heavy O
but O
it O
works O
perfectly O
. O

works O
as O
expected O
. O
  O
Love O
the O
zebra O
print O
zipper O
pouch O
it O
comes O
with O
. O
  O
Arrived O
quickly O
and O
price O
was O
very O
competetive O
. O
  O
Keeping O
it O
in O
my O
suitcase O
for O
travelling O
as O

Decent O

  O
A O
good O

Lighter O
weight O
than O
the O
last O
silver O
model O

  O
That O
one O
lasted O

nearly O
10 O

I O
have O
owned O
one O
of O
these O

in O
a O
hotel O
bathroom O

Great O
dryer O

Very O

I O

it O
down O
an O
entire O
flight O
of O
stairs O
. O
Just O

as O
you O
get O
so O
accustomed O

this O
one O

anything O
an O
improvement O
over O
my O
old O

Dual O

a O
must O

every O
time O

hurts O
your O
ears O
while O
under O
the O
dryer O

the O
loud O
sound O
of O
the O
dryer O

I O
have O
to O
use O
it O

takes O
hours O

hours O
just O

  O
I O
used O
this O
dryer O
3 O

Exactly O

product O
, O
not O
like O
some O
of O
the O
low O
end O
products O
out O

. O
This O
is O
salon O
quality O
! O
! O

My O
previous O
Vagabond O
, O
which O
I O
loved O
and O
traveled O
with O
for O
many O
years O
, O
finally O
kicked O
the O
bucket O
and O
I O
replaced O
it O
today O
with O
the O
current O
model O
. O
I O
was O
a O
little O
bummed O
that O
purple O
was O
no O
longer O
a O
color O
option O
( O
strange O
, O
since O
it O
is O
in O
the O
other O
Conair O
models O
) O
, O
but O
was O
extremely O
upset O
to O
discover O
that O
the O
power O
cord O
is O
now O
a O
full O
six O
inches O
shorter O
! O
I O
could O
n't O
believe O
it O
and O
got O
the O
old O
one O
out O
of O
the O
trash O
to O
compare O
side O
by O
side O
. O
Shorter O
. O
By O
a O
lot O
. O
This O
makes O
a O
huge O
impact O
on O
how O
far O
from O
the O
outlet O
I O
can O
stand O
while O
drying O
my O
hair O
and O
is O
incredibly O
annoying O
. O
Would O
have O
happily O
paid O
more O
for O
the O
longer O
cord O
. O
Very O
disappointed O
. O

I O
have O
had O
this O
hair O
dryer O
for O
a O
week O
and O
I O
love O
it O
! O
I O
can O
dry O
my O
hair O
in O
under O
10mins O
. O
The O
attachment O
allows O
you O
to O
put O
the O
dryer O
on O
your O
hair O
which O
speeds O
up O
the O
drying O
time O
. O
I O
have O
thin O
but O
long O
hair O
and O
I O
'm O
amazed O
at O
how O
quickly O
it O
dries O
my O
hair O
. O

It O
's O
a O
good O
hair O
dryer O
the O
attachment O
just O
wo O
n't O
stay O
on O

good O
power O

just O
like O
another O
reviewer O
wrote O
- O
the O
bonnet O
's O
elastic O
is O
so O
tight O
that O
it O
hurt O
my O
head O
and O
I O
did O
n't O
have O
very O
large O
rollers O
on O
. O
I O
took O
her O
advice O
and O
took O
out O
the O
elastic O
and O
put O
in O
a O
long O
shoe O
lace O
which O
was O
a O
very O
time O
consuming O
and O
frustrating O
job O
but O
it O
worked O
. O
Plus O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
anyone O
could O
sit O
there O
with O
the O
setting O
on O
high O
. O
The O
medium O
setting O
is O
almost O
too O
hot O
. O
If O
I O
had O
n't O
read O
the O
her O
review O
about O
replacing O
the O
elastic O
, O
I O
would O
of O
sent O
it O
back O
. O

Works O
great O
arrived O
on O
time O
. O

The O
disk O
somehow O
smells O
like O
plastic O

Just O
like O
my O
old O
one O
. O
  O
I O
love O
it O
. O

I O
love O
this O

Great O
product O

Love O
this O
hair O

. O
So O
glad O
i O
got O
it O
. O
Also O
, O
i O
live O
what O
the O
company O
stands O
for O
. O

Best O
blow O
dryer O
ever O
... O
you O
can O
feel O
the O
quality O
as O
soon O
as O
you O
pick O
it O
up O
... O
performance O
= O
none O
better O
... O
worth O
every O
penny O
. O

I O
love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
! O
  O
It O
is O
quieter O
than O
my O
older O
Conair O
. O
  O
It O
has O
nice O
speed O
/ O
temperature O
settings O
that O
blow O
dry O
quickly O
without O
as O
much O
damage O
. O
I O
can O
dry O
my O
below O
shoulder O
length O
hair O
with O
the O
medium O
heat O
/ O
air O
setting O
in O
less O
than O
10 O
minutes O
. O
My O
hair O
is O
soft O
and O
easy O
to O
style O
, O
plus O
attachments O
stay O
on O
tight O
. O
I O
will O
buy O
Remington O
from O
now O
on O
. O

This O
hairdryer O
is O
perfect O
for O
thick O
hair O
. O
The O
handle O
feels O
comfortable O
while O
in O
use O
and O
the O
nozzle O
has O
vent O
holes O
, O
so O
you O
can O
get O
real O
close O
to O
your O
scalp O
and O
the O
air O
deflects O
through O
the O
holes O
. O
Great O
design O
. O

I O
just O
replaced O
my O
old O
Conair O
hair O
dryer O
. O
I O
like O
the O
1875 O
models O
, O
as O
they O
are O
usually O
more O
powerful O
and O
work O
more O
quickly O
. O
I O
do O
not O
recommend O
this O
model O
, O
however O
. O
Although O
it O
is O
an O
1875 O
power O
, O
it O
works O
like O
one O
of O
the O
smaller O
, O
less O
powerful O
models O
. O
And O
this O
one O
is O
terribly O
, O
terribly O
loud O
. O
I O
'm O
actually O
concerned O
that O
I O
might O
suffer O
hearing O
loss O
if O
I O
were O
to O
use O
this O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
. O
I O
'll O
be O
returning O
this O
one O
. O

Dries O
my O
hair O
fast O
and O
is O
n't O
very O
loud O
. O
Absolutely O
love O
it O
! O
Thank O
you O
so O
much O
! O

Good O
! O

Perfect O
replaced O
old O
one O
I O
was O
very O
pleased O
with O
. O

Hair O
dryer O
works O
great O

When O
I O
first O
turned O
this O
product O
on O
my O
hair O
was O
wet O
. O
When O
I O
turned O
this O
device O
off O
my O
hair O
was O
dry O
. O
I O
purchased O
this O
because O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
the O
cheapest O
product O
available O
. O
It O
worked O
perfectly O
and O
does O
appear O
to O
be O
a O
quality O
product O
. O
I O
have O
been O
very O
happy O
so O
far O
. O

This O
dryer O
is O
ok O
I O
was O
hoping O
for O
something O
a O
little O
more O
powerful O
than O
what O
I O
already O
had O
. O
It O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
but O
no O
quicker O
than O
my O
other O
blow O
dryer O
... O
in O
fact O
I O
feel O
like O
it O
takes O
my O
hair O
a O
bit O
longer O
to O
try O
. O
  O
And O
it O
is O
HEAVY O
. O
After O
reading O
the O
great O
reviews O
, O
I O
guess O
I O
was O
hoping O
for O
something O
more O
than O
it O
actually O
was O
-- O
which O
is O
a O
regular O
ok O
hair O
dryer O
. O

It O
's O
missing O
a O
screw O
to O
put O
this O
together O
:-( O
Besides O
that O
..... O
I O
received O
it O
on O
time O
; O
it O
's O
the O
right O
size O
, O
and O
the O
price O
was O
excellent O
....... O

Quiet O
and O
quick O
. O
My O
old O
hairdryer O
was O
a O
screamer O
and O
I O
got O
this O
one O
because O
I O
was O
developing O
tinnitus O
and O
everything O
I O
read O
suggested O
controlling O
decibels O
was O
important O
. O
  O
The O
buttons O
are O
right O
where O
you O
grip O
the O
handle O
, O
so O
it O
takes O
a O
little O
getting O
used O
to O
placing O
fingers O
so O
you O
're O
not O
changing O
your O
settings O
. O
  O
My O
hair O
is O
smoother O
. O

I O
was O
very O
satisfy O
with O
my O
order O
and O
it O
was O
delievery O
on O
time O
as O
promise O
. O

Perfect O
for O
my O
needs O
! O

Works O
good O
. O
  O
Does O
n't O
seem O
to O
have O
the O
output O
force O
on O
low O
speed O
that O
my O
previous O
hairdryer O
had O
( O
wattage O
is O
the O
same O
) O
. O
  O
Seems O
to O
get O
the O
warmest O
heat O
it O
needs O
to O
be O
on O
high O
. O
  O
I O
prefer O
a O
low O
speed O
with O
high O
heat O
. O

I O
love O
the O
hair O
dryer O
by O
conair O

home O
220 O
  O

I O
spent O
a O
very O
long O
time O
waiting O
for O
the O
right O
deal O
on O
an O
ionic O
hair O
dryer O
and O
this O
was O
the O
first O
time O
in O
at O
least O
6 O
months O
that O
I O
saw O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
with O
an O
appealing O
price O

. O
I O
took O
the O
plunge O

VERY O
happy O

turns O
out O
very O
smooth O
and O
is O
even O
shiny O
after O
I O

The O
clip O
on O

amazing O
for O
focusing O

definitely O
helps O
with O
minimizing O
frizz O

Everything O

5 O

  O
Had O
an O

. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
hair O
dryer O
and O
is O

lot O
lighter O
than O
the O
clunky O
old O
one O
I O
used O
to O
have O
. O
It O
looks O
great O
and O
helps O
my O
morning O
routine O
go O
a O
lot O
faster O
. O
I O
am O
able O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
quickly O
and O
I O
love O
the O
attachment O
that O
it O
comes O
with O
to O
be O
able O
to O
focus O
all O
the O
hot O
air O
on O
one O
section O
of O
hair O
at O
a O
time O
as O
I O
am O
brushing O
it O
out O
. O
When O
I O
use O
the O
attachment O
it O
makes O
my O
hair O
look O
a O

better O
as O
well O
than O
without O
using O
it O
. O

  O
And O
my O
hair O
requires O
less O
touching O
up O
on O
the O
second O
day O
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
sleek O
and O
stylish O
hair O
dryer O
. O
It O
looks O
very O
nice O
! O
It O
’s O
powerful O
at O
2200 O
watts O
. O
This O
hair O
dryer O
comes O
with O
a O
concentrator O
nozzle O
but O
no O
diffuser O
. O
However O
, O
a O
previous O
diffuser O
that O
I O
owned O
fit O
on O
this O
just O
fine O
. O
It O
has O
a O
nice O
long O
cord O
too O
. O
The O
only O
thing O
is O
the O
cord O
is O
really O
thick O
so O
it O
easily O
knocks O
stuff O
down O
if O
anything O
gets O
in O
its O
way O
. O
I O
was O
very O
excited O
to O
get O
an O
opportunity O
to O
receive O
this O
for O
testing O
and O
inspection O
purposes O
. O
It O
works O
very O
well O
and O
dries O
my O
hair O
quickly O
. O
I O
like O
the O
more O
powerful O
hair O
blowers O
because O
they O
dry O
hair O
much O
faster O
than O
lower O
wattage O
dryers O
do O
. O
This O
one O
comes O
in O
black O
and O
looks O
very O
stylish O
. O
The O
concentrator O
works O
well O
too O
but O
you O
do O
need O
to O
push O
hard O
to O
get O
it O
on O
the O
hair O
dryer O
. O
It O
has O
three O
temperatures O
, O
hot O
, O
warm O
, O
and O
cold O
( O
or O
room O
temperature O
but O
it O
always O
feels O
cold O
to O
me O
. O
) O
It O
also O
has O
two O
speeds O
, O
low O
and O
high O
. O
In O
addition O
, O
it O
comes O
with O
a O
cool O
shot O
button O
, O
which O
gives O
you O
a O
blast O
of O
cold O
air O
when O
you O
push O
the O
button O
. O
The O
button O
is O
easy O
to O
push O
but O
it O
's O
also O
black O
so O
it O
blends O
into O
the O
hair O
dryer O
. O
I O
would O
have O
liked O
it O
if O
the O
cool O
shot O
button O
was O
a O
different O
color O
. O
Other O
than O
that O
though O
, O
I O
really O
like O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
It O
's O
powerful O
and O
efficient O
at O
drying O
my O
hair O
. O
This O
review O
is O
a O
reflection O
of O
my O
own O
personal O
experience O
with O
this O
product O
. O

I O
have O
been O
impressed O
with O
each O
Xtava O
product O
I O
have O
tried O
and O
this O
hair O
dryer O
is O
no O
different O
. O
This O
dryer O
is O
powerful O
enough O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
completely O
in O
a O
short O
amount O
of O
time O
. O
I O
like O
the O
attachments O
, O
especially O
the O
diffuser O
. O
I O
'm O
also O
quite O
fond O
of O
the O
bright O
blue O
color O
. O
Product O
provided O
to O
facilitate O
this O
review O
, O
but O
all O
opinions O
are O
honest O
and O
my O
own O
. O

Not O
good O
at O
all O

The O
first O
thing O
I O
noticed O
about O
the O
hair O
dryer O
was O
the O
sturdy O
sleek O
cord O
which O
felt O
well O
made O
and O
strong O
. O
The O
cord O
is O
long O
enough O
to O
plug O
into O
the O
wall O
and O
be O
able O
to O
use O
it O
6 O
ft O
away O
from O
the O
outlet O
. O
The O
hair O
dryer O
comes O
with O
the O
concentrator O
nozzle O
which O
I O
would O
have O
died O
without O
but O
it O
does O
n’t O
bring O
the O
diffuser O
nozzle O
which O
I O
found O
kind O
of O
odd O
since O
most O
companies O
include O
both O
nozzles O
. O
Anyway O
, O
so O
I O
plugged O
in O
the O
hair O
dryer O
and O
started O
to O
blow O
dry O
my O
hair O
using O
the O
same O
brush O
I O
always O
use O
. O
I O
tested O
out O
the O
different O
heat O
settings O
and O
was O
impressed O
with O
how O
quickly O
the O
temperatures O
change O
. O
If O
you O
switch O
from O
hot O
to O
cold O
it O
happens O
instantly O
meanwhile O
I O
’ve O
owned O
hair O
dryers O
that O
take O
at O
least O
20 O
- O
30 O
seconds O
just O
to O
make O
the O
temperature O
change O
. O
The O
two O
different O
speed O
settings O
are O
your O
standard O
low O
and O
high O
, O
yet O
, O
at O
the O
high O
speed O
the O
noise O
the O
drier O
makes O
is O
not O
loud O
at O
all O
. O
The O
dryer O
is O
n’t O
completely O
soundless O
but O
it O
is O
n’t O
obnoxiously O
loud O
compared O
to O
others O
I O
’ve O
owned O
. O
I O
found O
that O
when O
I O
used O
this O
hair O
dryer O
my O
styling O
time O
was O
20 O
- O
30 O
minutes O
quicker O
than O
usual O
. O
In O
addition O
, O
my O
hair O
felt O
really O
smooth O
afterwards O
and O
the O
end O
result O
was O
n’t O
as O
frizzy O
as O
I O
expected O
considering O
I O
have O
curly O
hair O
and O
I O
'm O
not O
a O
professional O
at O
blow O
drying O
. O
  O
UPDATE O
: O
After O
using O
the O
hairdryer O
for O
a O
few O
months O
, O
I O
noticed O
that O
whenever O
I O
would O
use O
this O
dryer O
my O
scalp O
would O
become O
very O
oily O
right O
after O
blow O
drying O
. O
Whenever O
I O
use O
my O
old O
Revlon O
hair O
dryer O
my O
scalp O
remains O
dry O
and O
I O
have O
never O
had O
this O
issue O
before O
. O
I O
have O
n't O
changed O
any O
other O
hair O
care O
or O
hair O
tool O
besides O
this O
dryer O
so O
this O
must O
be O
the O
culprit O
. O
  O
I O
did O
receive O
this O
complimentary O
for O
review O
purposes O
but O
this O
does O
not O
influence O
my O
opinion O
. O

Great O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
Fast O
and O
hot O
. O
  O
Good O
quality O
product O
. O

how O
did O
this O
product O
get O
so O
many O
5 O
star O
reviews?The O
product O
is O
good O
and O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
wall O
mounted O
dryer O
is O
excellent O
. O
The O
product O
fails O
in O
my O
view O
because O
the O
three O
tiny O
' O
Mollies O
' O
supplied O
to O
hold O
it O
to O
the O
wall O
are O
pathetically O
under O
engineered O
. O
The O
dryer O
will O
just O
pull O
off O
the O
wall O
after O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
. O
A O
better O
way O
to O
mount O
is O
to O
drill O
a O
second O
hole O
in O
the O
mounting O
plate O
and O
to O
screw O
it O
to O
a O
wall O
stud O
with O
long O
screws O
. O
Another O
good O
product O
hijacked O
by O
under O
engineered O
Chinese O
Manufacture O
! O

Nice O
dryer O
! O
Just O
as O
expected O
. O

Okay O
, O
I O
have O
fine O
hair O
so O
my O
hair O
does O
n't O
take O
that O
long O
to O
dry O
..... O
I O
can O
have O
my O
hair O
dry O
/ O
styled O
in O
about O
3 O
minutes O
with O
this O
powerful O
blow O
dryer O
and O
that O
is O
on O
the O
medium O
heat O
. O
  O
Great O

Really O

. O
The O
different O

are O

. O
And O
the O
cord O
keeper O
, O
oh O

  O
No O

) O

I O
absolutely O

. O
I O
not O
only O

it O
with O
my O
crafting O
! O
This O
dryer O
is O
AMAZING O
. O
Multiple O

Great O

Very O
powerful O

Only O
thing O
is O

where O
your O
fingers O
go O
so O
fingers O
push O
switches O
and O
changes O
settings O
while O
blow O
drying O
. O

Very O
good O
article O
! O
i O
have O
4C O
natural O
hair O
and O
I O
use O
the O
large O
comb O
to O
make O
the O
blow O

, O
wonderful O
! O
i O
'm O
in O
loveI O
leave O
in O
france O
and O
the O
article O
was O
well O
packed O

My O
hair O
is O
thick O
and O
long O
. O
  O
It O
dries O
frizzy O
without O
blowing O
it O
dry O
. O
  O
I O
do O
not O
get O
  O
the O
chance O
to O
go O
to O
the O
salon O
much O
. O
  O
The O
attachments O
on O
this O
dryer O
make O
me O
feel O
like O
I O
am O
doing O
something O
for O
myself O
without O
devoting O
more O
time O
. O
  O
I O
love O
the O
color O
blue O
and O
black O
. O
  O
I O
loved O
the O
opportunity O
to O
use O
this O
dryer O
. O
  O
In O
exchange O
for O
I O
am O
also O
providing O
my O
honest O
and O
unbiased O
opinion O
. O
  O
The O
drying O
time O
on O
my O
hair O
was O
cut O
down O
by O
a O
few O
minutes O
. O
  O
I O
have O
a O
three O
year O
old O
daughter O
that O
will O
not O
be O
still O
for O
anything O
. O
I O
used O
it O
on O
hers O
for O
just O
a O
minute O
on O
low O
cool O
. O
  O
It O
was O
perfect O
. O
  O
Not O
too O
strong O
but O
enough O
to O
help O
knock O
out O
the O
wetness O
. O
  O
I O
prefer O
the O
high O
warm O
on O
mine O
. O
  O
I O
do O
not O
need O
to O
further O
damage O
my O
hair O
. O
  O
Which O
means O
cutting O
out O
the O
drying O
time O
is O
preserving O
my O
hair O
some O
. O
  O
Without O
the O
attachments O
this O
hair O
  O
dryer O
should O
travel O
easily O
. O
  O
The O
cord O
is O
not O
too O
heavy O
and O
should O
roll O
up O
easily O
. O

Excellent O
product O
! O
Powerful O
and O
light O
weight O
.. O
I O
love O
it O
! O
! O
! O

I O
have O
thick O
, O
long O
hair O
and O
this O
was O
recommended O
by O
my O
hair O
stylist O
. O
It O
is O
very O
powerful O
and O
dries O
my O
hair O
more O
quickly O
than O
anything O
I O
have O
bought O
before O
. O
  O
I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
. O

Love O
it O
! O

Bought O
for O
my O
son O
and O
he O
loves O
it O
and O
uses O
it O
every O
day O
. O
  O
Not O
too O
loud O
which O
is O
great O
. O

I O
have O
thick O
long O
hair O
that O
takes O
what O
it O
seems O
like O
hours O
to O
dry O
. O
So O
I O
had O
to O
see O
if O
this O
hair O
dryer O
  O
was O
as O
great O
as O
it O
says O
. O
And O
it O
is O
! O
My O
hair O
drying O
time O
got O
cut O
more O
than O
half O
of O
what O
it O
usually O
is O
. O
And O
my O
hair O
does O
n't O
feel O
frizzy O
like O
it O
does O
most O
of O
the O
time O
. O
I O
never O
tried O
a O
iconic O
hair O
dryer O
before O
but O
I O
heard O
good O
things O
about O
it O
. O
So O
I O
am O
excited O
to O
have O
this O
one O
. O
And O
it O
's O
big O
but O
it O
is O
also O
light O
weighed O
, O
which O
makes O
it O
perfect O
. O
It O
comes O
with O
two O
attachments O
and O
I O
tell O
you O
when O
I O
tried O
both O
of O
them O
out O
, O
it O
felt O
good O
on O
my O
scalp O
. O
It O
was O
like O
a O
light O
massage O
. O
I O
am O
proudly O
leaving O
my O
honest O
opinion O
about O
this O
product O
that O
I O
have O
received O
. O

Works O
better O
than O
expected O

I O
got O
this O
for O
the O
wife O
. O
But O
have O
to O
say O
it O
's O
not O
noticeably O
lighter O
than O
the O
previous O
unit O
we O
had O
but O
it O
is O
very O
sharp O
looking O
. O
The O
controls O
are O
all O
conveniently O
placed O
with O
a O
plenty O
of O
speed O
and O
heat O
settings O
. O
The O
cord O
is O
of O
very O
good O
quality O
and O
pretty O
lengthy O
. O
I O
feel O
for O
the O
price O
it O
's O
a O
very O
good O
buy O
and O
would O
really O
recommend O
it O
. O

I O
received O
this O
hair O
dryer O
as O
a O
sample O
for O
review O
and O
evaluation O
and O
I O
have O
found O
it O
to O
be O
working O
well O
. O
It O
comes O
in O
a O
nice O
box O
that O
is O
very O
suitable O
for O
gifting O
. O
  O
The O
pros O
on O
this O
dryer O
for O
me O
are O
that O
it O
is O
lightweight O
, O
has O
a O
long O
cord O
, O
is O
sleek O
and O
not O
bulky O
, O
and O
comes O
with O
a O
concentration O
too O
. O
The O
con O
for O
me O
( O
someone O
that O
has O
long O
, O
thin O
, O
fine O
hair O
) O
is O
that O
it O
tends O
to O
be O
hot O
even O
on O
the O
lower O
settings O
. O
Sometimes O
this O
is O
a O
pro O
but O
overall O
for O
my O
hair O
type O
it O
is O
a O
bit O
too O
hot O
for O
the O
total O
drying O
process O
so O
my O
hair O
tends O
to O
be O
more O
tangled O
at O
the O
end O
. O
All O
things O
considered O
I O
still O
think O
it O
's O
a O
great O
dryer O
and O
I O
realize O
not O
everyone O
has O
my O
hair O
type O
. O

I O
absolutely O
love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
My O
old O
hair O
dryer O
would O
take O
me O
20 O
mins O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
and O
now O
I O
can O
dry O
my O
hair O
in O
5 O
mins O
. O

I O
love O
this O
blow O
dryer O
. O
  O
It O
dries O
my O
hair O
, O
which O
is O
very O
thick O
in O
very O
little O
time O
. O
  O
High O
quality O
, O
especially O
compared O
to O
the O
blow O
dryers O
you O
can O
buy O
in O
the O
local O
market O
. O

After O
12 O
years O
, O
my O
old O
( O
exactly O
the O
same O
) O
dryer O
died O
- O
it O
did O
n't O
owe O
me O
a O
thing O
. O
  O
I O
was O
pleased O
to O
find O
the O
same O
design O
still O
available O
. O
  O
We O
have O
a O
small O
bathroom O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
space O
to O
leave O
a O
dryer O
on O
a O
counter O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
certainly O
not O
going O
to O
take O
one O
out O
each O
morning O
and O
put O
it O
away O
after O
use O
. O
  O
This O
is O
so O
darn O
convenient O
! O

Love O
it O
but O
it O
's O
so O
small O
. O
Ca O
n't O
wear O
rollers O
with O
it O
unless O
your O
willing O
to O
put O
in O
the O
time O
to O
stretch O
out O
the O
cap O
and O
pull O
your O
hair O
. O

great O
dryer-----love O
the O
diffuser O
that O
comes O
with O
it O
. O
  O
Not O
too O
expensive O
and O
it O
's O
lightweight O
and O
compact O
. O
  O
very O
highly O
recommend O

When O
I O
first O
received O
this O
product O
i O
was O
a O
little O
sketchy O
, O
as O
hair O
dryers O
normally O
make O
my O
hair O
super O
frizzy O
. O
This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
amazing O
. O
The O
diffuser O
works O
just O
as O
it O
should O
. O
My O
normally O
frizzy O
hair O
was O
smooth O
and O
flyaway O
free O
, O
which O
is O
attributed O
to O
the O
ionic O
technology O
. O
This O
dryer O
has O
2 O
speeds O
and O
3 O
heat O
settings O
, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
cool O
button O
, O
which O
is O
always O
good O
after O
a O
long O
time O
of O
use O
on O
your O
scalp O
. O
Its O
very O
lightweight O
and O
easy O
to O
use O
. O
Even O
a O
beginner O
, O
like O
myself O
, O
can O
get O
use O
out O
of O
this O
product O
. O
It O
has O
a O
nice O
cool O
blue O
tone O
on O
the O
front O
, O
which O
is O
good O
for O
me O
. O
All O
in O
all O
i O
'd O
say O
this O
product O
is O
the O
best O
hair O
dryer O
i O
have O
used O
to O
date O
. O
Would O
highly O
recommend O
to O
anyone O
. O

This O
Conair O
works O
so O
much O
better O
than O
most O
blow O
dryers O
. O
  O
It O
is O
a O
great O
color O
and O
had O
a O
great O
output O
. O
  O
I O
was O
so O
very O
impressed O
with O
how O
much O
quality O
you O
get O
for O
the O
price O
. O
  O
The O
reason O
I O
am O
giving O
it O
4 O
stars O
is O
because O
it O
is O
a O
little O
heavier O
, O
not O
cheap O
plastic O
at O
all O
. O

Super O
powerful O
, O
blows O
a O
lot O
of O
air O
. O
  O
I O
had O
a O
much O
more O
expensive O
hairdryer O
that O
was O
almost O
double O
the O
price O
for O
the O
past O
6 O
years O
before O
this O
one O
and O
this O
one O
is O
even O
more O
powerful O
than O
my O
old O
one O
. O
  O
I O
need O
a O
strong O
hairdryer O
b O
/ O
c O
I O
have O
very O
thick O
hair O
. O
  O
Just O
to O
give O
you O
an O
idea O
, O
wall O
mounted O
hair O
dryers O
at O
hotels O
are O
totally O
useless O
to O
me O
. O
  O
If O
I O
plan O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
while O
traveling O
, O
I O
have O
to O
bring O
one O
. O
  O
This O
one O
comes O
with O
a O
bunch O
of O
different O
attachments O
. O
  O
And O
I O
like O
the O
animal O
print O
( O
although O
my O
husband O
does O
not O
but O
that O
print O
was O
much O
cheaper O
for O
some O
reason O
than O
the O
solid O
color O
ones O
) O

Whoa O
... O
amazing O
what O
a O
difference O
this O
hair O
dryer O
makes O
! O
I O
ve O

quickly O
with O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
feel O
cheap O
and O
I O
like O
how O
the O
top O
is O
long O
enough O
that O
my O
hair O
( O
I O
have O
mid O
- O
length O
hair O
) O
does O
n't O
get O
sucked O
into O
the O
back O
of O
it O
where O
the O
fan O
is O
. O
Buttons O
are O
easy O
to O
work O
with O

better O
than O
those O
you O
have O
slide O
up O
and O
down O
. O

n't O

  O
Serves O
its O
purpose O

what O
more O
could O
I O
ask O
! O
? O

Quit O
heating O
after O
60 O
days O
, O

I O
have O
thick O
and O
course O
hair O
and O
it O
takes O
like O
an O
hour O
or O
so O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
and O
with O
this O
dryer O
it O
takes O
10 O
- O
15 O
minutes O
. O
So O
glad O
I O
purchased O
this O
. O

I O
absolutely O
loved O
this O
dryer O
! O
It O
dried O
my O
thick O
, O
heavy O
hair O
so O
fast O
! O
Also O
, O
the O
cord O
was O
fantastically O
long O
! O
Would O
be O
5 O
stars O
, O
but O
I O
bought O
it O
last O
April O
, O
and O
sadly O
it O
has O
already O
died O
on O
me O
. O
There O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
short O
in O
the O
cord O
. O
If O
I O
wiggle O
the O
cord O
around O
at O
the O
base O
of O
the O
dryer O
, O
I O
can O
still O
get O
it O
to O
work O
a O
little O
. O
Tempted O
to O
buy O
another O
, O
since O
the O
price O
is O
so O
reasonable O
. O

Recomendado O
, O

I O
love O
this O
dryer O
because O
it O
is O
so O
gentle O
with O
only O
two O
settings O
. O
The O
band O
on O
the O
bonnet O
is O
tight O
at O
first O
, O
but O
after O
weekly O
or O
biweekly O
use O
it O
gets O
a O
bit O
more O
comfortable O
. O
I O
cover O
my O
ears O
with O
Wrapp O
- O
it O
bands O
when O
drying O
. O
The O
carrying O
case O
is O
convenient O
and O
everything O
fits O
perfectly O
inside O
even O
after O
several O
uses O
. O

Kind O
of O
weak O
, O
not O
quite O
powerful O
or O
hot O

for O
my O

Love O
this O
hairdryer O
! O
I O
've O
had O
maybe O
5 O
or O
6 O
of O
them O
. O
Mostly O
they O
only O
die O
when O
I O
drop O
them O
on O
the O
floor O
. O
I O
love O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
new O
one O
fits O
the O
wall O
mount O
from O
the O
last O
one O
and O
I O
did O
n't O
have O
to O
make O
new O
holes O
in O
my O
wallpaper O
! O
It O
's O
a O
great O
little O
hairdryer O
and O
not O
expensive O
. O

Purchased O
because O
I O
needed O
a O
hair O
dryer O
, O
but O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
spend O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
. O
I O
like O
it O
. O
If O
you O
want O
something O
that O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
and O
does O
n't O
cost O
a O
fortune O
, O
it O
's O
a O
great O
option O
for O
you O
. O
I O
've O
used O
it O
several O
times O
now O
and O
I O
've O
had O
no O
issues O
. O

Convenient O
and O
classy O
wall O
mount O
hair O
dryer O
. O
No O
fumbling O

when O
I O
want O
it O

Good O
, O
basic O
dryer O
. O
Liking O
it O
a O
lot O
. O

great O
hair O
dryer O

I O
usually O
dread O
having O
to O
blow O
dry O
my O
hair O
as O
it O
is O
very O
long O
and O
pretty O
thick O
, O
so O
it O
would O
often O
take O
an O
hour O
or O
more O
to O
get O
it O
ALMOST O
all O
the O
way O
dry O
. O
Because O
of O
the O
time O
it O
takes O
to O
blow O
dry O
, O
and O
the O
fact O
I O
am O
semi O
lazy O
, O
I O
have O
had O
the O
same O
motel O
type O
dryer O
for O
about O
15 O
years O
( O
YIKES O
) O
and O
been O
hesitant O
to O
buy O
a O
new O
one O
figuring O
they O
would O
ALL O
take O
forever O
to O
dry O
the O
mop O
on O
my O
head O
. O
When O
I O
was O
offered O
the O
Xtava O

2200W O
hair O
dryer O
to O

an O
unbiased O
opinion O
I O
was O
pretty O
excited!This O
hairdryer O
is O
a O
decent O
size O
, O
yet O
very O
lightweight O
. O
It O
has O
2 O
heat O
settings O
as O
well O
as O
the O
option O
for O
a O
cool O

also O
a O
detachable O
piece O
to O
put O
on O
it O
for O
when O
you O
want O
to O
dry O
your O
hair O
section O
by O
section O
to O
straighten O
it O
. O
After O
trying O
this O
the O
first O
time O
, O
I O
now O
want O
to O
use O
it O
every O
time O
I O
wash O
my O
hair O
! O
It O
is O
super O
easy O
to O
handle O
, O
which O
is O
awesome O
if O
you O
're O
all O
over O
the O
place O
flipping O
your O
hair O
around O
like O
I O
do O
. O
One O
of O
my O
favorite O
parts O
was O
that O
the O
back O
vent O
did O
n't O
try O
to O
eat O
my O
hair O
! O
My O
old O
one O
would O
suck O
it O
in O
if O
you O
got O
it O
within O
an O
inch O
of O
that O
vent O
, O
I O
am O
tendered O
headed O
, O
IT O
HURT O
! O
  O
ALL O
of O
my O
hair O
was O
dry O

no O
slightly O
damp O
spots O

all O
within O
20 O
minutes O
. O
I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
particular O
hair O
dryer O
for O
those O
with O
long O
thick O
like O

Daughter O
is O
very O
satisfied O
. O
Dryer O
does O
everything O
she O
expected O
. O
And O
a O
great O
price O
. O

best O
blowdryer O
I O
've O
owned O
, O
I O
've O
had O
it O
for O
3 O
years O
and O
still O
works O
as O
good O
as O
new O
. O

Works O
very O
well O
so O
far O
. O
  O
Seems O
sturdier O
than O
other O
brands O
. O
  O
Dries O
hair O
quickly O
. O
  O
Noise O
is O
per O
a O
normal O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
Heat O
and O
air O
velocity O
both O
normal O
. O
I O
went O
through O
3 O
or O
4 O
of O
a O
competing O
model O
that O
would O
last O
only O
1 O
- O
2 O
years O
and O
then O
burn O
out O
. O
  O
I O
had O
just O
been O
replacing O
them O
because O
the O
new O
dryer O
would O
fit O
into O
the O
old O
wall O
mount O
, O
but O
decided O
not O
to O
keep O
shelling O
out O
money O
for O
an O
inferior O
product O
that O
did O
not O
last O
. O
Bought O
a O
different O
competing O
model O
but O
it O
started O
making O
a O
high O
pitched O
sound O
after O
2 O
days O
, O
and O
did O
not O
get O
hot O
enough O
to O
efficiently O
dry O
hair O
so O
it O
was O
returned O
. O
Finally O
bought O
this O
one O
. O
  O
It O
is O
not O
as O
aesthetically O
pleasing O
as O
competing O
models O
, O
but O
not O
quite O
as O
ugly O
as O
the O
photo O
makes O
it O
seem O
. O
  O
The O
dryer O
is O
white O
and O
gray O
( O
wish O
it O
were O
all O
white O
) O
, O
but O
the O
gray O
is O
a O
normal O
gray O
, O
not O
the O
greenish O
color O
that O
it O
looks O
like O
in O
the O
listing O
. O
  O
The O
wall O
mount O
does O
not O
install O
flush O
to O
the O
wall O
, O
as O
others O
have O
mentioned O
, O
but O
it O
is O
close O
enough O
. O
  O
I O
quickly O
got O
used O
to O
turning O
it O
on O
and O
off O
at O
the O
wall O
mount O
- O
it O
not O
the O
annoyance O
I O
anticipated O
. O
  O
In O
addition O
, O
if O
you O
put O
it O
in O
the O
wall O
mount O
while O
it O
is O
on O
, O
it O
automatically O
turns O
off O
, O
which O
is O
kind O
of O
convenient O
. O
  O
The O
best O
part O
of O
this O
dryer O
is O
that O
you O
can O
open O
the O
back O
and O
clean O
the O
fan O
blades O
. O
  O
I O
suspect O
build O
up O
of O
lint O
on O
the O
blades O
is O
what O
eventually O
caused O
the O
other O
dryers O
to O
burn O
out O
, O
and O
with O
the O
other O
dryers O
it O
is O
not O
possible O
to O
access O
the O
blades O
( O
at O
least O
not O
easily O
) O
. O
  O
Thus O
, O
I O
expect O
this O
dryer O
to O
last O
longer O
. O
  O
There O
is O
also O
a O
hidden O
setting O
where O
you O
can O
turn O
the O
power O
up O
, O
and O
I O
did O
that O
when O
it O
first O
arrived O
. O

It O
dries O
my O
hair O
very O
fast O
but O
is O
a O
little O
on O
the O
heavy O
side O
. O

I O
absolutely O
love O
this O
dryer O
! O
I O
was O
a O
bit O
apprehensive O
at O
first O
because O
of O
the O
price O
tag O
but O
it O
's O
well O
worth O
the O
money O
. O
I O
have O
curly O
, O
color O
treated O
hair O
and O
I O
definitely O
noticed O
the O
difference O
using O
this O
hair O
dryer O
verses O
my O
old O
one O
. O
My O
hair O
feels O
healthy O
, O
smoother O
... O
as O
if O
I O
just O
came O
back O
from O
the O
salon O
! O
Great O
product O
! O

Best O
hairdryer O
on O
the O
market O
. O
Not O
too O
loud O
and O
dries O
hair O
fast O
. O
I O
should O
have O
bought O
2 O

Cut O
my O
drying O
time O
in O
half O
! O
! O
Love O
it O
:) O

I O
love O
this O
hairdryer O
, O
so O
lightweight O
and O
my O
hair O
is O
great O
. O
  O
It O
really O
does O
make O
a O
difference O
to O
have O
a O
great O
hairdryer O
. O

Better O
than O
expected O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
... O
Grat O
price O
but O
too O
weak O
. O

What O
can O
you O
say O
about O
a O
hairdryer O
? O
It O
dries O
my O
hair O
nicely O
lol O
. O
It O
does O
n't O
get O
as O
hot O
as O
I O
expected O
, O
like O
my O
last O
one O
did O
. O
But O
it O
's O
a O
nice O
hairdryer O
for O
the O
price O
! O

all O
excellent O
, O
recommended O
100 O
% O

a O
great O
buy O
. O

Used O
this O
at O
a O
hotel O
and O
had O
to O
have O
it O
! O
  O
Best O
hair O
dryer O
I O
ever O
used O
. O

Not O
as O
loud O
as O
other O
hair O
dryers O
, O
and O
has O
plenty O
of O
power O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
feel O
that O
it O
gets O
as O
hot O
as O
some O
of O
my O
other O
hair O
dryers O
, O
but O
that O
's O
probably O
not O
a O
bad O
thing O
because O
i O
do O
n't O
over O
dry O
my O
hair O
. O

A O
great O
lightweight O
product O
, O
easily O
stored O
on O
a O
shelf O
. O
  O
I O
bought O
it O
to O
heat O
process O
my O
hair O
color O
, O
and O
it O
does O
the O
trick O
. O

very O
good O
product O
. O
Love O

. O
5 O
stars O

Great O
product O

Works O
great O
. O
  O

  O
Fyi O
: O
I O
'm O
28 O
& O
never O
owned O
a O
hair O
dryer O
before O
so O
I O
do O
nt O
have O
anything O
to O
compare O
it O
to O
. O
  O
BTW O
If O
you O
think O
it O
this O
product O
sucks O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
; O
it O
blows O
. O

A O
little O
bit O
too O
big O
for O
travelling O

Straight O
out O
of O
the O
box O
this O
is O
the O
best O
blow O
dryer O
I O
have O
ever O
used O
. O
  O
It O
is O
really O
light O
weight O
and O
easy O
to O
handle O
. O
  O
There O
are O
3 O
settings O
and O
2 O
temps O
with O
a O
cool O
blast O
for O
setting O
your O
hair O
. O
  O
I O
  O
have O
long O
thick O
frizzy O
hair O
that O
some O
days O
I O
would O
love O
to O
cut O
all O
off O
. O
  O
My O
other O
hair O
dryer O
, O
never O
got O
rid O
of O
any O
of O
the O
frizziness O
. O
  O
Big O
plus O
also O
is O
the O
diffuser O
  O
attachment O
that O
is O
included O
. O
  O
What O
a O
difference O
, O
with O
the O
1800 O
watts O
my O
hair O
is O
dry O
in O
1/2 O
the O
time O
and O
is O
smoother O
than O
I O
could O
have O
every O
imagined O
. O
  O
This O
is O
definitely O
a O
salon O
grade O
product O
at O
a O
great O
price O
. O
  O
I O
did O
receive O
at O
a O
special O
deal O
and O
love O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
was O
able O
to O
test O
such O
a O
wonderful O
product O
. O

nice O
hair O
dryer O

This O
is O
my O
second O
Xtava O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
I O
have O
to O
say O
this O
one O
makes O
even O
that O
one O
look O
wimpy O
. O
  O
I O
can O
not O
believe O
how O
fast O
it O
dried O
my O
hair O
. O
  O
Right O
out O
of O
the O
shower O
and O
it O
was O
only O
about O
4 O
minutes O
for O
my O
thick O
hair O
to O
be O
completely O
dry O
and O
cooled O
. O
  O
This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
a O
little O
hefty O
compared O
to O
others O
but O
I O
think O
it O
is O
easier O
to O
handle O
than O
my O
other O
Xtava O
. O
  O
Also O
even O
though O
the O
hottest O
setting O
is O
quite O
hot O
the O
hair O
dryer O
itself O
only O
heats O
up O
at O
the O
end O
. O
  O
You O
can O
hold O
the O
barrel O
if O
you O
need O
to O
maneuver O
it O
. O
The O
power O
was O
unexpected O
. O
  O
My O
hair O
did O
tangle O
slightly O
but O
it O
was O
no O
big O
deal O
considering O
how O
much O
more O
volume O
I O
gained O
. O
  O
Even O
after O
brushing O
my O
hair O
it O
is O
n't O
flat O
. O
  O
My O
hair O
is O
smoother O
than O
usual O
as O
if O
I O
had O
flat O
ironed O
it O
. O
  O
The O
hot O
is O
hot O
and O
the O
cold O
is O
cold O
as O
if O
you O
had O
air O
conditioning O
for O
your O
head O
. O
  O
So O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
spend O
extra O
time O
cooling O
after O
drying O
. O
  O
It O
was O
a O
matter O
of O
seconds O
after O
drying O
to O
having O
perfect O
cool O
hair O
. O
  O
The O
extra O
power O
of O
this O
dryer O
may O
have O
a O
learning O
curve O
. O
  O
I O
actually O
had O
to O
figure O
out O
where O
I O
had O
wet O
hair O
because O
I O
'm O
used O
to O
having O
still O
damp O
hair O
. O
  O
Anywhere O
I O
pointed O
it O
for O
a O
few O
seconds O
resulted O
in O
dry O
sections O
of O
hair O
. O
  O
That O
's O
how O
good O
this O
dryer O
is O
. O

I O
am O
very O
impressed O
with O
this O
Allure O
professional O
hairdryer!Upon O
arrival O
it O
was O
packaged O
in O
a O
nice O
black O
matte O
box O
, O
with O
stylish O
decoration O
and O
writing O
. O
Hair O
dryer O
was O
wrapped O
in O
a O
plastic O
covering O
, O
and O
has O
a O
black O
shiny O
finish O
and O
matte O
finish O
. O
This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
super O
quiet O
and O
performs O
very O
well O
. O
Very O
lightweight O
. O
There O
are O
3 O
heat O
settings O
, O
and O
  O
2 O

cool O
burst O
button O
. O
The O
cord O
is O
very O
long O
and O
heavy O
duty O
, O
which O
makes O
it O
nice O
to O
not O
be O
limited O
in O
cord O
length O
. O
It O
has O
an O
angled O
end O
for O
air O
that O
fits O
over O
the O
end O
of O
the O
blow O
dryer O
. O
The O
blow O
dryer O
works O
very O
fast O
. O
My O
daughter O
's O
hair O
usually O
takes O
about O
8 O
- O
10 O
mins O
to O
dry O
and O
that O
dry O
time O
has O
been O
cut O
in O
half O
! O
She O
is O
very O
impressed O
with O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
I O
love O
the O
tourmaline O
Ionic O
Ceramic O
blow O
dryer O
, O
it O
is O
very O
gentle O
on O
your O
hair O
. O
I'm O
very O
glad O
I O
was O
chosen O
to O
test O
and O
review O
this O
hairdryer O
from O
Xtava O
. O

It O
works O
really O
well O
! O

Item O
was O
the O
exact O
item O
as O
seem O
on O
the O
pictures O
. O
Came O
with O
all O
three O
extra O
pieces O
for O
blowing O
out O
the O
hair O
. O
Use O
it O
recently O
n O
it O
was O
good O
...... O
I O
must O
say O
its O
very O
hot O
. O
  O
Good O
tool O
. O
Its O
just O
to O
see O
how O
long O
it O
will O
last O
. O
But O
no O
regrets O
in O
this O
purchase O
n O
I O
'm O
loving O
my O
dryer O

Cord O
is O
way O
too O
short O
. O
  O
I O
ca O
n't O
hold O
it O
over O
my O
head O
when O
standing O
in O
my O
usual O
spot O
. O
  O
Also O
, O
it O
's O
not O
hot O
enough O
. O
  O
The O
hottest O
setting O
is O
more O
warm O
than O
hot O
. O
  O
It O
is O
lighter O
and O
quieter O
than O
most O
, O
but O
I O
still O
regret O
buying O
it O
. O
  O
I O
did O
not O
tried O
the O
attachments O
. O
  O
They O
went O
into O
the O
trash O
along O
with O
the O
box O
. O

Seems O
great O
at O
first O
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O
great O
for O
long O
hair O
unless O
your O
unnaturally O
careful O
while O
using O
it O
. O
It O
's O
always O
a O
possibility O
that O
long O
hair O
can O
get O
sucked O
into O
the O
back O
end O
of O
a O
hair O
dryer O
, O
but O
because O
of O
the O
extremely O
small O
size O
, O
it O
happens O
extremely O
easily O
with O
this O
one O
. O
Especially O
if O
you O
flip O
your O
head O
upside O
down O
to O
dry O
it O
, O
you O
lose O
even O
more O
control O
. O
The O
first O
time O
it O
sucked O
some O
hair O
up O
, O
it O
lost O
significant O
drying O
force O
. O
The O
second O
time O
, O
it O
stopped O
working O
altogether O
. O
Not O
to O
mention O
the O
hair O
loss O
. O
It O
is O
, O
however O
, O
without O
a O
doubt O
, O
the O
most O
adorable O
hair O
dryer O
I O
've O
ever O
seen O
. O

Love O
it O
. O

I O
love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
It O
is O
very O
quiet O
but O
strong O
. O
  O
It O
puts O
out O
an O
amazing O
amount O
of O
heat O
. O
  O
The O
only O
negative O
thing O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
the O
buttons O
are O
right O
where O
my O
fingers O
are O
and O
sometimes O
I O
shut O
it O
off O
. O

The O
powers O
is O
not O
as O
great O
as O
previous O
dryers O
I O
have O
owned O
. O
I O
bought O
it O
because O
it O
was O
pink O
& O
pretty O
. O
Wish O
I O
had O
n't O
now O
. O

The O
most O
awful O
hair O
dryer O
ever O
. O
Very O
Heavy O
and O
the O
hot O
almost O
burnt O
my O
hair O
. O
Make O
a O
light O
weight O
product O
Remington O
! O
! O
! O

Great O
appliance O
for O
the O
price O
. O

My O
old O
and O
expensive O
blowdryer O
that O
I O
received O
as O
a O
birthday O
present O
still O
ran O
but O
slowly O
. O
Hence O
, O
my O
new O
replacement O
. O
Would O
have O
been O
happy O
for O
an O
orange O
one O
but O
sadly O
Amazon O
sent O
me O
a O
yucky O
fuchsia O
dryer O
. O
At O
least O
, O
it O
works O
great O
and O
has O
more O
options O
than O
I O
thought O
. O
Great O
for O
someone O
always O
on O
the O
go O
! O

Normally O
I O
would O
have O
rated O
this O
item O
as O
very O
high O
. O
However O
of O
the O
3 O
Hair O
Dryers O
purchased O
, O
one O
was O
defective O
. O
While O
the O
hair O
dyer O
aspect O
worked O
, O
the O
green O
light O
( O
bottom O
left O
side O
) O
did O
not O
. O
This O
defect O
was O
not O
apparent O
until O
the O
Hair O
Dryer O
was O
installed O
. O
I O
understood O
this O
to O
be O
a O
good O
hair O
dryer O
, O
but O
a O
defection O
like O
this O
does O
not O
look O
good O
. O
I O
will O
be O
thinking O
twice O
about O
any O
future O
purchases O
of O
this O
Hair O
Dryer O
( O
regarding O
product O
quality O
) O
as O
I O
ca O
n't O
afford O
to O
have O
a O
defective O
unit O
installed O
. O
I O
had O
to O
give O
my O
customer O
a O
40 O
% O
discount O
because O
of O
this O
. O
NOT O
GOOD O
. O
Thank O
you O
, O
David O

Have O
used O
this O
dryer O
in O
hotels O
and O
when O
my O
old O
dryer O
died O
, O
I O
purchased O
this O
one O
. O
  O
Have O
had O
it O
a O
few O
months O
now O
and O
absolutely O
love O
it O
. O
  O
It O
is O
the O
only O
dryer O
I O
have O
used O
that O
has O
both O
a O
low O
and O
a O
high O
fan O
volume O
on O
the O
cool O
setting O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
heat O
settings O
. O
It O
's O
mounted O
in O
the O
guest O
bathroom O
and O
everyone O
who O
has O
stayed O
with O
us O
have O
commented O
how O
great O
it O
is O
and O
how O
nice O
it O
looks O
. O

i O
got O
this O
for O
my O
mother O
, O
her O
old O
one O
is O
going O
bad O
, O
she O
was O
so O
happy O
when O
i O
got O
it O
for O
her O
birthday O
. O
she O
's O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
product O
. O
thank O
you O

Nice O
hair O
dryer O
for O
the O
price O
, O
but O
it O
was O
n't O
anything O
special O
and O
seemed O
quite O
basic O
. O
  O
I O
did O
n't O
feel O
as O
though O
my O
hair O
dried O
any O
faster O
or O
looked O
any O
different O
than O
the O
old O
basic O
hair O
dryer O
I O
've O
been O
using O
for O
the O
past O
5 O
years O
or O
so O
. O
  O
I O
do O
like O
the O
color O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
cord O
is O
quite O
a O
bit O
shorter O
than O
the O
cord O
on O
my O
old O
hair O
dryer O
. O

I O
am O
one O
of O
those O
lucky O
people O
who O
can O
achieve O
poker O
straight O
hair O
or O
curly O
hair O
just O
by O
the O
styling O
tool O
I O
use O
on O
the O
end O
of O
the O
blow O
dryer O
. O
  O
When O
I O
was O
given O
the O
opportunity O
to O
test O
this O
Ionic O
Hair O
dryer O
for O
quality O
, O
I O
was O
super O
excited O
. O
  O
There O
were O
many O
things O
I O
liked O
about O
this O
blow O
dryer.1 O
. O
  O
I O
like O
the O
shape O
of O
the O
unit O
. O
  O
I O
was O
able O
to O
hold O
the O
dryer O
by O
both O
the O
shaft O
and O
the O
handle O
depending O
on O
my O
needs O
to O
get O
the O
best O
angle O
for O
all O
my O
hair.2 O
. O
  O
It O
took O
about O
1/3 O
less O
time O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
than O
with O
my O
other O
blow O
dryer O
even O
though O
that O
one O
has O
more O
watts O
. O
  O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
if O
it O
was O
due O
to O
the O
less O
drying O
time O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
this O
is O
an O
ionic O
dryer O
that O
my O
hair O
was O
less O
frizzy O
. O
  O
It O
's O
winter O
here O
in O
Indiana O
and O
I O
generally O
have O
to O
use O
argon O
oil O
on O
my O
hair O
after O
drying O
to O
tame O
the O
frizzies O
. O
  O
I O
did O
not O
have O
to O
use O
the O
oil O
after O
using O
this O
blow O
dryer.3 O
. O
  O
It O
's O
extremely O
light O
weight O
and O
quieter O
than O
my O
previous O
dryer.4 O
. O
  O
It O
came O
with O
both O
a O
diffuser O
and O
a O
concentration O
nozzle O
. O
  O
I O
use O
the O
diffuser O
when O
I O
want O
curly O
hair O
and O
the O
nozzle O
when O
I O
want O
to O
go O
straight O
and O
sleek O
. O
One O
thing O
I O
did O
notice O
is O
a O
burning O
smell O
the O
first O
time O
I O
used O
the O
unit O
. O
  O
By O
the O
time O
I O
finished O
drying O
my O
hair O
though O
, O
the O
smell O
was O
gone O
. O
  O
Overall O
, O
I O
am O
very O
impressed O
with O
the O
quality O
and O
results O
of O
this O
Rimini O
Xtava O
. O

I O
really O
really O
wanted O
to O
like O
this O
hair O
dryer O
, O
even O
ordered O
again O
after O
sending O
back O
the O
first O
one O
that O
arrived O
without O
the O
concentrator O
nozzle O
. O
After O
reading O
all O
the O
great O
reviews O
raving O
about O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
hair O
dryer O
I O
was O
somewhat O
disappointed O
with O
it O
.. O
It O
's O
really O
powerful O
, O
I O
think O
even O
to O
the O
extent O
that O
it O
can O
over O
- O
dry O
and O
damage O
certain O
type O
of O
hair O
if O
one O
is O
not O
careful O
, O
so O
I O
'm O
sure O
it O
will O
dry O
hair O
in O
a O
shorter O
period O
of O
time O
, O
but O
I O
still O
have O
doubts O
about O
it O
being O
ceramic O
and O
using O
ionic O
diffuse O
technology O
which O
makes O
hair O
less O
frizzy O
and O
damages O
less O
, O
as O
I O
found O
no O
mention O
of O
it O
on O
the O
hair O
dryer O
, O
the O
box O
itself O
or O
the O
paper O
insert O
that O
comes O
with O
it O
. O
  O
The O
hair O
dryer O
has O
somewhat O
cheap O
and O
plastic O
feeling O
.. O
the O
seams O
are O
somewhat O
poorly O
made- O
they O
scratch O
your O
hand O
when O
you O
touch O
them O
, O
and O
the O
cold O
shot O
button O
is O
not O
a O
real O
button O
per O
se O
, O
it O
's O
a O
piece O
of O
plastic O
hanging O
there O
, O
which O
I O
think O
can O
get O
stuck O
in O
or O
broken O
after O
some O
use O
.. O
Anyway O
, O
it O
's O
an O
OK O
hair O
dryer O
for O
the O
price O
, O
very O
powerful O
, O
deserving O
the O
title O
Professional O
, O
but O
somewhat O
cheaply O
made O
.. O
I O
guess O
it O
makes O
it O
easier O
to O
write O
raving O
reviews O
about O
a O
product O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
pay O
for O
it O
, O
but O
for O
the O
price O
you O
can O
get O
a O
little O
less O
powerful O
but O
higher O
quality O
product O

This O
is O
nice O
..... O

wife O
loves O
it O

great O
dryer O
... O
I O
just O
wish O
the O
cord O
wen O
further O
up O
into O
the O
retractable O
handle O
. O

Too O
big O
and O
heavy O
. O
  O
Needs O
to O
be O
permanently O
mounted O
in O
order O
to O
be O
truly O
useful O
. O

DAUGHTER O
LOVES O
IT O

DANGEROUS!!!This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
SO O
NOT O
WORTH O
YOUR O
$ O
$ O

$ O
! O
! O
! O
  O
As O
reported O
by O
other O
reviewers O
the O
flat O
sliding O
on O
/ O
off O
switch O
was O
difficult O
to O
operate O
, O
especially O
if O
your O
hands O
were O
not O
totally O
dry O
. O
  O
The O
folding O
handle O
stopped O
staying O
open O
after O
6mo O
. O
  O
This O
created O
a O
significant O
pinching O
hazard O
. O
  O
After O
9mo O
the O
dryer O
began O
to O
over O
heat O
each O
time O
it O
was O
used O
. O

very O
good O

I O
love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
! O
It O
comes O
with O
two O
attachments O
which O
help O
keep O
the O
heat O
damage O
to O
hair O
at O
a O
minimum O
. O
The O
design O
is O
aesthetically O
pleasing O
and O
easy O
to O
use O
. O
It O
heats O
evenly O
and O
does O
a O
fantastic O
job O
. O
It O
is O
high O
quality O
for O
a O
great O
price O
. O
I O

me O
10 O
- O
15 O
minutes O
, O
( O
in O
a O
salon O
, O
this O
means O
more O
clients O
and O
more O
money O
) O
. O
  O
I O
told O
a O
colleague O
of O
mine O
and O
now O
we O
are O
ordering O
more O
. O
  O

be O
as O
good O
as O
the O
first O
day O
for O

    O
Ps O
, O
I O
just O
placed O

a O
great O

  O
Does O
a O
wonderful O
job O
. O
Will O
not O
buy O
another O
brand O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
unit O
. O
Compact O
put O
full O
of O
power O
. O
  O
I O
wish O
this O
was O
the O
standard O
unit O
used O
by O
hotels O
. O
  O
Highly O
recommended O
. O

Only O
last O
for O
one O
year O
. O

This O
is O
a O
really O
nice O
hair O
dryer O
, O
the O
only O
reason O
I O
did O
not O
give O
it O
5 O
stars O
is O
that O
its O
a O
little O
heavy O
for O
me O
. O
  O
It O
dries O
nicely O
and O
very O
quiet O
compared O
to O
any O
other O
dryers O
I O
have O
had O
. O
  O
I O
will O
definitely O
keep O
it O
, O
I O
can O
use O
the O
workout O
. O

Ca O
n't O
bla O
the O
company O
but O
this O
item O
does O
not O
work O
. O
It O
falls O
off O
with O
the O
suction O
cups O
and O
can O
cause O
issues O
. O
Save O
your O
money O
. O

The O
dryer O
looks O
good O
and O
works O
. O
I O
ordered O
this O
because O
a O
friend O
's O
recommendation O
. O
Honestly O
, O
I O
feel O
it O
is O
a O
bit O
overly O
expensive O
. O
I O
was O
hoping O
my O
hair O
would O
be O
smooth O
and O
shiny O
after O
use O
but O
the O
outcome O
was O
not O
that O
great O
. O
Plus O
, O
there O
is O
no O
English O
manual O
, O
only O
Japanese O
one O
. O
A O
bit O
frustrated O
. O

Loud O
like O
most O
hair O
dryers O
. O
I O
like O
the O
temperature O
setting O
and O
retractable O
cord O
. O
Air O
flow O
very O
good O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
unit O
when O
the O
more O
expensive O
hair O
dryer O
I O
had O
purchased O
from O
Staples O
online O
had O
a O
bonnet O
that O
would O
not O
have O
fit O
the O
head O
of O
a O
tiny O
baby O
.... O
let O
alone O
an O
adult O
with O
curlers O
in O
her O
hair O
! O
  O
this O
dryer O
is O
very O
lightweight O
and O
does O
n't O
put O
out O
very O
hot O
air O
but O
it O
is O
sufficient O
to O
dry O
your O
hair O
( O
just O
takes O
a O
little O
longer O
) O
and O
the O
price O
was O
great O
. O

Well O
i O
first O

I O

this O
one O
fits O
the O
bill O

! O
I O
will O
save O
alot O
of O
money O
and O
time O
doing O
my O
hair O
with O
this O
equipment O
without O
the O
need O
of O
the O
salons O
... O
A+ O

I O
love O
this O
blow O
dryer O
. O
It O
is O
so O
much O
more O
powerful O
than O
the O
one O
I O
have O
been O
using O
and O
gets O
my O
hair O
dry O
in O
half O
the O
time O
( O
the O
box O
says O
80 O
% O
of O
the O
time O
but O
I O
swear O
it O
seems O
faster O
than O
that O
) O
. O
I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
I O
have O
been O
wasting O
time O
drying O
my O
hair O
when O
there O
have O
been O
products O
on O
the O
market O
like O
THIS O
that O
will O
get O
it O
done O
so O
much O
faster O
. O
Until O
now O
I O
did O
n't O
realize O
there O
was O
a O
difference O
but O
I O
swear O
there O
is O
. O
When O
I O
use O
this O
blow O
dryer O
my O
hair O
seems O
more O
voluminous O
than O
when O
I O
use O
my O
old O
one O
. O
This O
is O
also O
very O
lightweight O
and O
sleek O
, O
not O
to O
mention O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
is O
quiet O
. O
I O
could O
n't O
believe O
how O
quiet O
it O
was O
! O
If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
professional O
blow O
dryer O
I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
one O
. O
This O
product O
was O
provided O
to O
me O
for O
testing O
and O
quality O
evaluation O
. O

Second O
one O
of O
this O
week O
, O
works O
great O
. O

I O
would O
have O
gone O
with O
0 O
stars O
if O
I O
had O
that O
option O
. O
I O
gave O
this O
to O
my O
daughter O
for O
her O
semester O
in O
Spain O
. O
She O
said O
it O
overheated O
this O
first O
time O
she O
used O
it O
and O
has O
been O
afraid O
to O
use O
it O
again O
. O
So O
this O
product O
was O
basically O
a O
complete O
waste O
of O
money O
. O
The O
bad O
part O
is O
I O
got O
an O
email O
saying O
the O
first O
one O
I O
ordered O
was O
n't O
coming O
so O
I O
ordered O
a O
second O
. O
The O
first O
one O
came O
as O
well O
as O
the O
second O
. O
I O
did O
n't O
need O
a O
blow O
dryer O
to O
use O
in O
the O
states O
so O
now O
I O
have O
one O
that O
ca O
n't O
be O
used O
and O
I O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
want O

Fast O

and O

This O
hairdryer O

yet O
powerful O
. O
  O
My O
first O
one O
lasted O
over O
15 O
years O
, O
I O
'm O
hoping O
this O
one O
lasts O
as O
long O
or O
longer O
! O

I O
absolutely O
love O
this O

I O
absolutely O
love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
I O
did O
a O
lot O
of O
research O
as O
to O
what O
people O
where O
saying O
was O
the O
best O
hair O
dryer O
nowdays O
and O
it O
consistenly O
showed O
this O
one O
! O
I O
love O
the O
high O
pressure O
and O
the O
different O
settings O
. O
My O
hair O
is O
silky O
and O
definitely O
not O
frizzy O
by O
the O
end O
of O
a O
hair O
drying O
session O
. O
:) O

works O
great O
. O
abundant O
heat O
. O
quieter O
than O
its O
predecessor O
. O

Wife O
loves O
it O
! O

I O
purchased O
the O
product O
for O
its O
retractable O
cord O
and O
this O
did O
not O
work O
. O
Would O
not O
recommend O

I O
got O
them O
on O
time O
, O
so O
credits O
to O
Amazon O
Prime O
for O
being O
fantastic O
. O
Unfortunately O
, O
the O
product O
was O
defective O
and O
did O
n't O
work O
at O
all O
. O
The O
material O
used O
is O
very O
cheap O
, O
flimsy O
plastic O
and O
the O
weight O
of O
it O
is O
disturbingly O
light O
. O
I O
do O
not O
recommend O
this O
product O
even O
for O
people O
who O
rarely O
use O
their O
hair O
dryers O
. O

This O
hairdryer O
is O
great O
. O
I O
bought O
it O
because O
we O
recently O
moved O
and O
I O
could O
n't O
find O
my O
hairdryer O
in O
the O
sea O
of O
boxes O
. O
( O
I O
've O
had O
mine O
a O
long O
time O
so O
it O
was O
also O
a O
good O
excuse O
to O
get O
a O
new O
one O
. O
) O
I O
have O
fine O
thin O
hair O
. O
This O
hairdryer O
not O
only O
dries O
my O
hair O
very O
quickly O
but O
it O
gives O
it O
a O
lot O
of O
volume O
that O
I O
really O
need O
. O
I O
'm O
very O
happy O
with O
my O
purchase O
. O
I O
realize O
now O
how O
lousy O
my O
old O
dryer O
is O
. O

I O
have O
baby O
fine O
hair O
that O
takes O
forever O
to O
dry O
. O
Every O
morning O
, O
I O
spend O
about O
fifteen O

with O
a O
regular O

flat O

the O
first O
time O
, O
my O
hair O
was O
dry O
within O
seven O
minutes O
. O
I O
used O
the O
diffuser O
to O
prevent O
frizz O
and O
lifted O
my O
roots O
as O
I O
dried O
it O
. O
It O
gave O
my O
hair O
some O
extra O
bounce O
and O
body O
. O
I O
did O
not O
use O
any O
styling O
products O
except O
for O
a O
heat O
activated O
repair O
cream O
that O
I O
always O

definitely O
recommend O
it O

faster O
dry O
time O
. O
I O
was O
provided O
a O

giving O
you O
all O
my O

product O

First O
of O
all O
, O
this O
blow O
dryer O
is O
extremely O
light O
. O
  O
Surprisingly O
light O
even O
. O
If O
you O
have O
long O
hair O
( O
or O
a O
lot O
of O
it O
) O
, O
that O
is O
something O
you O
will O
surely O
appreciate O

also O
has O
a O
very O
powerful O
motor O
so O
that O
you O
can O
get O
the O
job O
done O
in O
no O

  O
If O
you O
are O
like O
me O
at O
all O
you O
need O
to O
get O
your O
hair O

  O
And O

' O
frizzy O
' O
dry O
as O
many O
blow O
dryers O
are O
good O
at O
accomplishing O
.... O
but O
sleek O
and O
sexy O
dry O
. O
  O
The O
diffuser O
nozzle O
of O
this O
product O
makes O
that O
possible O
for O
me O
. O
  O
It O
stays O
on O
securely O
while O
drying O
my O
hair O
and O
diffuses O
the O
air O
just O
enough O
that O
my O
hair O
no O
longer O
' O
frizzies O

rush O
, O

So O
far O
so O
good O
. O
Powerful O
. O
Does O
make O
my O
thin O
hair O
look O
more O
volumn O
. O

works O
great O
, O
sometimes O
cord O
re O
winder O
does O
not O
rewind O
all O
the O
way O
which O
can O
be O
a O
little O
frustrating O
. O
I O
had O
a O
model O
similar O
that O
lasted O
many O
years O
so O
when O
it O
died O
I O
bought O
this O
and O
it O
works O
the O
same O
and O
has O
the O
same O
issues O
with O
the O
cord O
winder O
. O
However O
I O
still O
like O
it O
very O
much O
as O
it O
does O
blow O
alot O
of O
air O
which O
is O
why O
bought O
it O
again O
. O

This O
midsize O
but O
powerful O
dryer O
is O
a O
game O
changer O
. O
I O
LOVE O
it O
! O
I O
have O
layered O
, O
waist O
length O
hair O
that O
becomes O
a O
frizz O
mess O
if O
not O
blow O
dried O
properly O
. O
The O
Volare O
V2 O
dries O
my O
hair O
smooth O
and O
silky O
. O
I O
've O
been O
using O
Sedu O
6000 O
which O
blows O
too O
strong O
and O
gets O
really O
hot O
surges O
that O
smokes O
my O
hair O
. O
V2 O
has O
the O
perfect O
combination O
of O
heat O
and O
airflow O
, O
and O
the O
cool O
temp O
actually O
blows O
cool O
air O
. O
My O
hair O
dries O
and O
styles O
faster O
with O
the O
V2 O
than O
the O
Sedu O
. O
Made O

Italy O

Four O
year O

My O
search O
for O
the O
perfect O
dryer O
is O
over O
. O

works O
great O

I O
've O
had O
this O
hair O
dryer O
for O
3 O
years O
now O
and O
it O
works O
great O
. O
I O
'm O
very O
surprised O
by O
reading O
some O
negative O
reviews O
. O
I O
have O
never O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
my O
hair O
dryer O
. O
My O
hair O
is O
very O
fine O
so O
it O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
in O
5 O
minutes O
. O
My O
only O
complaint O
is O
that O
it O
's O
a O
little O
loud O
for O
me O
cause O
I O
have O
a O
baby O
that O
takes O
naps O
all O
the O
time O
. O
Other O
than O
that O
it O
's O
a O
great O
basic O
hair O
dryer O
, O
nothing O
fancy O
. O
Although O
I O
did O
buy O
mine O
at O
Walmart O
cause O
it O
was O
cheaper O

Really O
great O
product O
for O
the O
money O
! O

This O
is O
a O
fine O
hair O
dryer O
... O
I O
am O
sorry O
it O
is O
so O
large O
however O
as O
I O
have O
a O
tender O
shoulder O
... O
  O
That O
makes O
it O
hard O
to O
use O
at O
times O
... O
The O
dryer O
however O
is O
a O
good O
one O
. O

My O
mom O
wanted O
a O
small O
and O
powerful O
hair O
dryer O
and O
when O
she O
opened O
this O
on O
Christmas O
day O
she O
was O
quite O
excited O
! O

I O
was O
in O
the O
market O
for O
a O
diffuser O
, O
and O
I O
never O
bought O
one O
before O
... O
I O
will O
say O
this O
is O
the O
first O
and O
last O
diffuser O
I O
will O
ever O
buy O
. O
I O
'll O
stick O
with O
a O
regular O
hair O
dryer O
with O
a O
diffuser O
on O
the O
end O
. O
The O
heat O
in O
this O
is O
n't O
as O
hot O
as O
I O
would O
like O
it O
to O
be O
, O
compared O
to O
my O
normal O
hair O
dryer O
that O
gets O
really O
hot O
. O
I O
had O
to O
diffuse O
my O
hair O
on O
low O
, O
and O
this O
was O
n't O
hot O
enough O
. O
Also O
, O
the O
low O
power O
was O
too O
low O
and O
the O
high O
power O
was O
too O
high O
. O
I O
also O
did O
not O
like O
how O
the O
air O
circulated O
in O
circles O
compared O
to O
the O
air O
coming O
out O
of O
a O
regular O
hair O
dryer O
in O
a O
straight O
motion O
. O
The O
circular O
motion O
blew O
all O
of O
my O
curls O
out O
( O
think O
if O
it O
like O
a O
fan O
you O
use O
to O
cool O
your O
house O
) O
, O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
that O
happen O
on O
my O
regular O
blow O
dryer O
. O
I O
will O
say O
, O
that O
my O
natural O
curls O
are O
not O
very O
tight O
, O
and O
my O
goal O
when O
diffusing O
my O
hair O
is O
to O
help O
maintain O
my O
curls O
with O
a O
low O
heat O
... O
This O
did O
not O
cut O
it O
at O
all O
.. O
Not O
hot O
enough O
, O
and O
the O
way O
that O
the O
air O
circulated O
blew O
my O
curls O
out O
. O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
if O
it O
is O
just O
this O
product O
or O
if O
it O
includes O
other O
diffusers O
like O
this O
as O
well O
... O
but O
I O
am O
sticking O
to O
my O
normal O
hair O
dryer O
with O
diffuser O
attachment O
! O

By O
far O
the O
best O
hair O
dryer O
I O
've O
used O
and O
for O
the O
price O
is O
definitely O
worth O
getting O
one O
of O
these O
bad O
boys O
! O
  O
Make O
sure O
to O
clean O
the O
back O
every O
now O
and O
then O
just O
place O
against O
your O
vacuum O
hose O
to O
get O
excess O
hair O
and O
debris O
! O

my O
all O
time O
favorite O
dryer O
! O

It O
came O
without O
instructions O
. O
  O
Works O
okay O
. O
  O
Nothing O
above O
average O
about O
it O
. O

Very O
happy O

Not O
the O
drying O
power O
expected O

Miss O
the O
Cool O
Shot O
feature O
of O
my O
cheaper O
dryer O
, O
do O
n't O
feel O
like O
it O
gets O
as O
hot O
either O
. O

Yea O

Great O
service O
, O
very O
nice O
blow O
dryer O
. O

The O
dryer O
is O
great O
; O
great O
temperature O
control O
too O
and O
very O
quiet O
. O
This O
is O
very O
important O
since O
I O
live O
in O
an O
apartment O
. O
  O
My O
only O
complaint O
is O
that O
the O
timer O
should O
also O
be O
quiet O
. O
It O
is O
constantly O
ticking O
( O
it O
's O
not O
loud O
but O
you O
notice O
) O
when O
in O
use O
so O
you O
hear O
it O
especially O
when O
you O
're O
in O
the O
dryer O
. O
When O
the O
dryer O
is O
finished O
it O
dings O
that O
it O
's O
done O
and O
it O
can O
startle O
you O
if O
you O
are O
not O
expecting O
it O
. O
I O
just O
have O
to O
get O
used O
to O
the O
ticking O
timer O
but O
in O
general O
I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
dryer O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
, O
powerful O
and O
affordable O
hair O
dryer O
. O
It O
really O
shortened O
dry O
time O
significantly O
. O
I O
purchased O
one O
for O
my O
daughter O
, O
but O
ended O
up O
getting O
2 O
more O
for O
me O
and O
my O
mom O
. O
We O
all O
love O
it O
. O

it O
to O
adhere O
plastic O
over O
my O
windows O
to O
keep O
out O
the O
draft O
during O
the O
winter O
. O
once O
in O
awhile O
you O
need O
a O
hair O
dryer O
in O
the O
house O
, O
even O
though O
you O
do O
not O
use O
it O
to O
dry O
your O
hair O
. O
this O
hair O
dryer O
is O
powerful O
and O
will O
do O
the O
job O
. O

My O
daughter O
and O
I O
are O
fighting O
over O
this O
hairdryer O
! O
We O
both O
tired O
it O
out O
and O
love O
it O
. O
It O
is O
black O
, O
not O
a O
silver O
color O
as O
in O
the O
picture O
; O
very O
sleek O
in O
design O
. O
It O
is O
lightweight O
to O
handle O
with O
a O
thick O
black O
cord O
. O
I O
knew O
this O
was O
going O
to O
be O
a O
powerful O
dryer O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
took O
it O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O
It O
is O
listed O
as O
2200W O
and O
it O
does O
not O
disappoint O
. O
My O
daughter O
has O
thinner O
, O
straight O
hair O
. O
It O
took O
us O
minutes O
to O
dry O
her O
hair O
on O
a O
medium O
heat O
setting O
. O
The O
high O
heat O
setting O
is O
VERY O
HOT O
. O
We O
did O
not O
use O
it O
. O
I O
have O
thick O
, O
coarse O
, O
curly O
hair O
. O
A O
few O
minutes O
on O
medium O
heat O
and O
a O
low O
air O
setting O
and O
I O
was O
good O
to O
go O
. O
We O
were O
given O
the O
opportunity O
to O
test O
and O
try O
this O
dryer O
. O
Based O
on O
our O
experience O
and O
our O
different O
hair O
styles O
, O
we O
both O
love O
this O
dryer O
and O
stand O
behind O
it O
based O
on O
its O
quality O
and O
construction O
. O
We O
love O
the O
design O
and O
the O
heat/ O
air O
flow O
settings O
. O
This O
is O
a O
powerful O
, O
well O
designed O
dryer O
that O
will O
last O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

So O
far O
this O
hair O
dryer O
is O
great O
. O
Last O
year O
I O
purchased O
a O
conair O
one O
similar O
to O
this O
, O
and O
it O
seemed O
to O
over O
heat O
easily O
. O
I O
like O
the O
fact O
that O
this O
one O
has O
a O
low O
, O
medium O
, O
and O
high O
setting O
. O
The O
attachments O
that O
came O
with O
it O
are O
pretty O
good O
. O
I O
know O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
were O
complaining O
about O
the O
brush O
being O
too O
soft O
, O
  O
and O
I O
can O
see O
why O
they O
say O
that O
. O
Fortunately O
my O
hair O
is O
n't O
that O
thick O
, O
so O
the O
soft O
brush O
works O
fine O
for O
me O
. O

It O
works O
really O
well O
! O
  O
best O
thing O
I O
have O
bought O
so O
far O
! O

I O
am O
very O
picky O
with O
my O
hair O
. O
I O
've O
only O
used O
hair O
dryers O
$ O
100 O
+ O
so O
buying O
this O
one O
was O
a O
huge O
risk O
for O
me O
! O
I O
have O
very O
long O
, O
straight O
hair O
that O
without O
any O
heat O
comes O
out O
wavy O
and O
sometimes O
frizzy O
. O
This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
quieter O
than O
my O
old O
one O
and O
definitely O
dries O
my O
hair O
pretty O
fast O
. O
My O
only O
problem O
with O
it O
is O
that O
the O
attachment O
falls O
off O
occasionally O
and O
the O
cord O
is O
insanely O
short O
. O

Great O
dryer O
for O
my O
hair O
. O
  O
Felt O
drying O
time O
faster O

muy O
bueno O

Love O
it O
.. O
small O
hands O
and O
it O
is O
very O
good O
and O
lasts O
a O
long O
time O
. O

Very O
unhappy O
with O
this O
dryer O
. O
I O
wanted O
to O
return O
it O
, O
but O
between O
a O
restocking O
charge O
and O
postage O
it O
just O
is O
n't O
worth O
the O
trouble O
. O
  O
The O
dryer O
is O
much O
larger O
than O
it O
looks O
and O
would O
stick O
out O
from O
the O
wall O
approximately O
6 O
inches O
. O
  O
It O
will O
go O
into O
the O
donation O
box O
! O
! O
! O
  O
Do O
n't O
order O
it O
! O
! O

works O

Good O

exelente O

I O
have O
never O
used O
a O
hair O
dryer O
that O
could O
dry O
my O
long O
hair O
in O
under O
30 O
minutes O
until O
I O
tried O
this O
one O
! O
(: O
this O
works O
amazingly O
and O
I O
love O
the O
way O
this O
hair O
dryer O
looks O
, O
so O
sleek O
looking O
. O
I O
would O
recommend O
this O
item O
to O
anyone O
who O
is O
looking O
For O
an O
affordable O
, O
well O
working O
hair O
dryer O
! O
! O

does O
the O
job O

Best O
blowdryer O
. O
Hair O
will O
be O
dry O
in O
record O
time O
. O
Only O
wish O
the O
concentration O
nozzle O
was O
permanently O
attached O
. O

For O
the O
price O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
beat O
it O
. O
Simple O
to O
use O
- O
no O
adjustments O
beyond O
  O
Low O
- O
Off O
- O
High O
. O
What O
more O
can O
a O
person O
want O
! O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
why O
the O
wide O
range O
of O
reviews O
. O
I O
bought O
this O
for O
my O
wife O
who O
has O
thin O
blonde O
hair O
. O
Before O
buying O
it O
for O
her O
, O
I O
noted O
that O
many O
reviewer O
said O
it O
worked O
for O
them O
and O
they O
had O
thick O
dark O
hair O
. O
There O
were O
also O
reviews O
of O
people O
saying O
it O
was O
way O
under O
powered O
and O
would O
n't O
dry O
their O
hair O
. O
So O
I O
ca O
n't O
figure O
out O
whether O
the O
quality O
varies O
from O
hairdryer O
to O
hairdryer O
or O
if O
the O
raving O
reviews O
are O
bogus O
. O
But O
, O
the O
hairdryer O
my O
wife O
received O
was O
too O
weak O
and O
took O
over O
an O
hour O
to O
dry O
her O
shoulder O
length O
hair O
. O

Had O
it O
for O
only O
a O
few O
months O
and O
it O
already O
is O
losing O
it O
's O
heating O
element O
. O
Also O
the O
dial O
to O
change O
the O
heat O
does O
n't O
work O
. O
The O
attachments O
are O
flimsy O
and O
get O
stuck O
easily O
. O
I O
ca O
n't O
wait O
for O
it O
to O
completely O
break O
so O
I O
can O
buy O
one O
that O
works O
properly O
. O
I O
wish O
I O
read O
all O
of O
the O
reviews O
for O
this O
product O
. O
Never O
again O
will O
I O
make O
that O
mistake O
. O

Do O
not O
get O
hot O
enough O
and O
a O
little O
smaller O
than O
what O
I O
thought O
. O

Bueno O

I O
noticed O
less O
static O
in O
my O
hair O
after O
the O
first O
time O
of O
using O
! O
I O
also O
notice O
more O
body O
if O
I O
use O
moose O
. O
It O
is O
a O
little O
heavier O
than O
a O
normal O
hair O
dryer O
but O
I O
have O
no O
problem O
putting O
up O
with O
that O
if O
it O
makes O
my O
hair O
look O
better O
! O
I O
also O
thought O
the O
price O
was O
great O
compared O
to O
other O
dryers O
of O
its O
likeness O
. O

Love O
the O
temperature O
... O
does O
not O
blow O
too O
hot O
. O
Getting O
use O
to O
the O
button O
locations O
. O

this O
is O
a O
great O
dryer O
for O
my O
curly O
frizzy O
long O
hair O
. O
makes O
it O
smoothe O

good O

Love O
it O
! O

works O
! O

Love O
it O
it O
dries O
my O
hair O
beautifully O

I O
received O
this O
hair O
dryer O
for O
review O
and O
testing O
purposes O
. O
This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
heavy O
but O
it O
packs O
a O
lot O
of O
heat O
and O
did O
not O
make O
my O
hair O
frizzy O
. O
I O
have O
wavy O
hair O
and O
I O
washed O
it O
, O
put O
a O
repair O
cream O
on O
, O
then O
toweled O
dried O
it O
and O
put O
the O
dryer O
on O
low O
speed O
and O
it O
was O
drying O
my O
hair O
fairly O
quickly O
. O
I O
used O
a O
vented O
paddle O
brush O
to O
blow O
dry O
and O
then O
I O
put O
it O
on O
the O
second O
higher O
heat O
setting O
until O
I O
finished O
the O
process O
. O
After O
that O
I O
pressed O
the O
cool O
shot O
button O
and O
it O
came O
out O
cold O
. O
I O
felt O
like O
I O
was O
a O
holding O
a O
salon O
quality O
dryer O
at O
home O
. O
I O
give O
this O
product O
5 O
stars O
! O

Awesome O

Four O
stars O
.... O
might O
upgrade O
this O
to O
5 O
in O
the O
next O
month O
or O
so O
. O
  O
This O
is O
a O
good O
little O
unit O
, O
perfect O
for O
travel O
or O
light O
use O
. O
  O
The O
first O
one O
overheated O
after O
3 O
- O
5 O
minutes O
of O
use O
, O
I O
was O
able O
to O
exchange O
it O
with O
the O
vendor O
, O
and O
the O
replacement O
unit O
seems O
to O
work O
perfectly O
. O
  O
Once O
its O
used O
a O
few O
more O
times O
, O
I O
'll O
either O
upgrade O
the O
rating O
or O
comment O
below O
. O
  O
Not O
a O
bad O
dryer O
overall O
, O
and O
it O
comes O
with O
2 O
attachments O
. O
  O
A O
pokey O
thing O
, O
and O
a O
duck O
bill O
thing O
. O

I O
like O
it O
, O
but O
it O
does O
n't O
really O
sound O
like O
a O
normal O
hair O
dryer O
, O
it O
sounds O
more O
like O
a O
vacuum O
. O

So O
far O
, O
so O
good O
! O
  O
Much O
better O
than O
my O
previous O
Hot O
Tools O
that O
blew O
up O
. O
  O
It O
is O
heavier O
, O
but O
dries O
my O
hair O
faster O
and O
with O
less O
tangles O
. O

It O
never O
worked O
. O
Not O
dual O

be O
. O
Will O
never O
buy O
any O
electric O

from O
Amazon O

would O
like O
it O
to O

on O
both O
my O
daughters O
hair O
to O
blow O
out O
for O
the O
first O
time O
! O
! O
! O
I O
bought O
this O
because O
I O
remembered O
my O
former O
stylist O
using O
this O
tool O
on O
my O
hair O
years O
ago O
! O
  O
I O
saw O
the O
price O
and O
jumped O
on O
it O
! O
  O
It O
's O
not O
fancy O
but O
it O
has O
four O
settings O
from O
cool O
to O
high O
heat O
and O
if O
you O
know O
how O
to O
use O
a O
blow O
dryer O
properly O
then O
you O
should O
be O
fine O
! O
  O
Thanks O
Amazon O
for O
having O
st O
half O
the O
price O
as O
Walmart O

:) O
. O
Worked O
like O
s O
charm O
on O
my O
girls O
and O

only O
used O
cool O
and O
warm O

. O

So O
I O
tested O
my O
new O
Allure O
2200w O
hair O
dryer O
and O
so O
far O
I O
really O
like O
it O
. O
It O
dries O
my O
long O
hair O
in O
no O
time O
and O
and O
it O
does O
n't O
leave O
my O
hair O
frizzy O
. O
It O
is O
lightweigth O
and O
it O
looks O
nice O
. O
The O
chrome O
looking O
lint O
trap O
at O
the O
back O
can O
be O
twisted O
easily O
and O
pulled O
out O
for O
cleaning O
. O
It O
looks O
nice O
but O
be O
very O
careful O
because O
( O
correct O
me O
if O
I O
am O
wrong O
) O
  O
it O
is O
made O
out O
of O
a O
plastic O
material O
that O
seems O
like O
it O
will O
easily O
break O
. O
I O
am O
going O
to O
use O
and O
keep O
this O
hair O
dryer O
in O
the O
bedroom O
vanity O
just O
incase O
I O
drop O
it O
, O
it O
will O
fall O
on O
the O
carpet O
floor O
. O
The O
extra O
attachment O
that O
came O
with O
it O
is O
also O
nice O
. O
I O
also O
have O
a O
1875w O
Conair O
infinity O
that O
I O
have O
been O
using O
for O
years O
. O
I O
love O
it O
but O
I O
compared O
the O
two O
today O
and O
they O
seem O
to O
blow O
about O
the O
same O
amount O
of O
air O
. O
If O
Allure O
is O
blowing O
harder O
, O
I O
can O
not O
really O
tell O
. O
The O
small O
button O
to O
press O
cool O
air O
is O
a O
bit O
hard O
to O
press O
but O
truth O
is O
, O
I O
never O
use O
the O
cool O
air O
function O
anyway O
so O
it O
do O
nt O
really O
matter O
for O
me O
. O
Over O
all O
, O
I O
will O
start O
using O
this O
Allure O
from O
now O
on O
and O
will O
give O
him O
hubby O
the O
Conair O
one O
. O
The O
other O
minor O
things O
does O
not O
hindrance O
the O
funtionality O
of O
this O
hair O
dryer O
so O
if O
you O
are O
planning O
to O
buy O
this O
, O
go O
ahead O
, O
give O
it O
a O
try O
. O
I O
think O
you O
will O
like O
it O
too O
. O

Will O
be O
perfect O
for O
Greece O
. O
  O
Just O
change O
setting O
to O
220/250 O
and O
plug O
in O
to O
adapter O
. O

Great O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
In O
addition O
to O
its O
useful O
purpose O
, O
I O
like O
the O
retracting O
cord O
so O
that O
when O
the O
dryer O
is O
put O
into O
a O
drawer O
, O
the O
cord O
is O
not O
getting O
into O
everything O
else O
in O
the O
drawer O
. O

It O
is O
very O
nice O
! O
Motor O
sounds O
are O
not O
cheep O
dryer O
at O
all O
. O
It O
is O
very O
powerful O
. O
Especially O
my O
long O
hair O
! O
! O
I O
am O
so O
satisfied O
with O
this O
item O
. O
But O
only O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
I O
need O
that O
it O
call O
Skin O
( O
make O
moisture O
to O
your O
face O
) O
dial O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
working O
noticed O
in O
the O
US O
, O
because O
Japan O
are O
more O
humidity O
country O
but O
not O
in O
the O
US O
. O

I O
love O
this O
hairdryer O
! O
It O
dries O
my O
hair O
in O
well O
over O
HALF O
the O
time O
my O
old O
one O
did O
. O
The O
removable O
back O
allows O
you O
to O
clean O
all O
the O
lent O
and O
stuff O
that O
gets O
in O
there O
over O
time O
. O
It O
's O
perfect O
, O
and O
it O
comes O
with O
a O
ton O
of O
attachments O
. O

I O
am O
so O
in O
love O
with O
this O
hairdryer O
. O
My O
hairdryer O
gave O
out O
recently O
so O
I O
was O
on O
the O
hunt O
for O
a O
new O
one O
. O
I O
purchased O
one O
in O
the O
store O
for O
double O
this O
price O
and O
I O
was O
not O
satisfied O
with O
it O
. O
It O
left O
my O
hair O
frizzy O
. O
One O
of O
my O
favorite O
things O
about O
this O
hairdryer O
is O
the O
slanted O
handle O
. O
It O
fits O
perfectly O
in O
my O
hand O
and O
it O
's O
just O
the O
right O
angle O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
without O
twisting O
my O
hand O
. O
Another O
great O
thing O
about O
this O
hair O
is O
that O
it O
really O
does O
dry O
your O
faster O
. O
I O
am O
really O
amazed O
by O
how O
fast O
it O
dries O
your O
hair O
and O
does O
not O
leave O
you O
with O
a O
frizzy O
head O
. O
I O
can O
actually O
use O
the O
high O
speed O
and O
not O
make O
a O
mess O
of O
my O
hair O
. O
I O
love O
the O
3 O
temperatures O
. O
Most O
hairdryers O
offer O
heat O
with O
the O
option O
of O
the O
cold O
button O
that O
you O
have O
to O
hold O
down O
. O
This O
hairdryer O
not O
only O
has O
the O
cold O
press O
button O
, O
but O
also O
high O
heat O
, O
low O
heat O
, O
and O
cool O
. O
So O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
hold O
down O
the O
cold O
button O
because O
the O
cool O
button O
is O
cold O
enough O
. O
I O
like O
to O
start O
out O
on O
high O
heat O
all O
over O
then O
I O
divide O
my O
hair O
and O
use O
low O
heat O
. O
After O
drying O
is O
complete O
, O
I O
like O
to O
set O
my O
hair O
with O
the O
cool O
option O
. O
The O
concentrator O
nozzle O
is O
just O
the O
right O
size O
. O
You O
can O
also O
remove O
the O
screen O
on O
the O
back O
of O
the O
hairdryer O
for O
easy O
cleaning O
. O
This O
is O
an O
amazing O
hairdryer O
. O
I O
love O
that O
I O
got O
the O
opportunity O
to O
test O
this O
hairdryer O
in O
exchange O
for O
my O
honest O
, O
unbiased O
opinion O
. O
I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
this O
hairdryer O
! O

It O
is O
the O
best O
hair O
dryer O
! O

Was O
as O
described O
and O
worked O
well O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
for O
a O
professional O
hair O
stylist O
with O
ten O
years O
experience O
. O
  O
This O
is O
the O
best O
dryer O
she O
's O
used O
thus O
far O
. O
  O
The O
price O
was O
amazing O
, O
less O
than O
half O
of O
what O
I O
almost O
paid O
locally O
. O
  O
Drying O
hair O
with O
this O
is O
much O
like O
aiming O
your O
head O
at O
a O
turbine O
engine O
with O
very O
high O
velocity O
constant O
airflow O
and O
heat O
, O
it O
dries O
hair O
in O
about O
1/3 O
the O
time O
of O
others O
she O
's O
used O
. O
  O
I O
'm O
very O
satisfied O
with O
this O
purchase O
. O

It O
works O
well O
, O
it O
's O
a O
blowdryer O
. O

Quit O
after O
a O
few O
months O
. O
  O
I O
bought O
this O
blow O
dryer O
because O
the O
one O
I O
was O
using O
was O
10 O
years O
old O
& O
could O
reasonably O
be O
expected O
to O
die O
soon O
. O
  O
The O
old O
one O
is O
still O
working O
. O
  O
This O
one O
is O
dead O
. O

I O
hate O
blow O
drying O
my O
hair O
. O
Its O
long O
and O
thick O
and O
my O
arms O
are O
hurting O
because O
it O
takes O
so O
long O
to O
get O
everything O
dry O
. O
I O
ca O
n't O
ever O
get O
a O
style O
to O
hold O
. O
I O
tried O
a O
blow O
out O
once O
. O
Once O
. O
So O
when O
I O
was O
given O
the O
opportunity O
to O
review O
this O
product O
for O
free O
I O
thought O
what O
do O
I O
have O
to O
lose?Thats O
when O
I O
realized O
i O
ve O
always O
just O
had O
a O
crappy O
blowdryer O
. O
The O
cord O
is O
super O
long O
and O
thick O
so O
it O
does O
n't O
get O
very O
tangled O
during O
use O
and O
I O
have O
freedom O
of O
movement O
. O
The O
power O
is O
really O
amazing O
. O
It O
only O
took O
about O
10 O
minutes O
give O
or O
take O
. O
I O
appreciate O
the O
warm O
setting O
because O
heat O
dries O
my O
scalp O
out O
. O
The O
blast O
of O
cool O
air O
made O
my O
hair O
shiny O
. O
The O
nozzle O
was O
great O
for O
taming O
frizz O
. O
This O
dryer O
has O
made O
blow O
drying O
my O
hair O
less O
of O
a O
chore O
. O
I O
ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
try O
my O
next O
blow O
out O
! O

I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
my O
new O
dryer O
from O
Xtava O
... O
my O
previous O
ones O
were O
revlon O
( O
both O
the O
same O
model) O
... O
the O
first O
one O
got O
pitched O
because O
the O
cord O
was O
becoming O
severed O
from O
the O
dryer O
... O
the O
second O
because O
it O
started O
making O
a O
horrible O
noise O
and O
sparked O
at O
me O
! O
  O
As O
long O
as O
this O
new O
one O
does O
n't O
do O
that O
, O
I O
will O
be O
happy O
! O
! O
I O
hope O
it O
lasts O
a O
long O
time O
! O
  O
It O
's O
a O
cute O
design O
, O
I O
have O
the O
blue O
flower O
. O

It O
is O
a O
very O
good O
item O
. O
Very O
easy O
  O
to O
switch O
on O
.. O
Perfect O
. O

Not O
as O
strong O
as O
i O
expected O

This O
replicates O
the O
same O
dryer O
I O
had O
for O
years O
but O
finally O
bit O
the O
dust O
. O
  O
Long O
time O
Conair O
buyer O
. O

I O
like O
this O
dryer O
but O
it O
is O
a O
little O
bit O
larger O
than O
I O
wanted O
. O
  O
Work O
really O
well O
and O
is O
not O
too O
loud O
. O

I O
had O
to O
have O
a O

I O
could O
dry O
my O
Silky O
Terrier O

long O
fine O

I O
needed O

because O
several O
years O

I O
hurt O
my O
hand O
and O
it O
's O
hard O
for O
me O
to O
hold O
a O
heavy O
hair O
dryer O
for O
very O
long O
. O
This O
is O
perfect O
. O
It O
's O
very O
lightweight O
, O
small O
and O
easy O
for O
me O
to O
hold O
. O
I O
love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
and O
do O
n't O
mind O
using O
it O
, O
as O
it O
does O

my O

to O
you O
out O
there O
, O

I O
used O
this O
dryer O
while O
at O
a O
Renaissance O
Suites O
and O
loved O
it O
. O
When O
I O
returned O
home O
, O
I O
looked O
it O
up O
online O
and O
ordered O
it O
. O
I O
'm O
just O
as O
pleased O
with O
it O
as O
I O
was O
with O
the O
one O
at O
Renaissance O
Suites O
because O
it O
is O
lightweight O
, O
quiet O
, O
and O
efficient O
. O

Sturdy O
, O
a O
bit O
bulky O
& O
gets O
incredibly O
hot O
. O
So O
if O
buying O
for O
salon O
use O
be O
careful O
when O
using O
with O
bleach O
on O
high O
heat O

It O
gets O
VERY O
HOT O
. O

Thank O

nice O

I O
love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
! O
This O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
hair O
dryer O
i O
have O
ever O
used O
. O
First O
i O
would O
like O
to O
say O
that O
alot O
of O
hair O
tools O
claim O
to O
be O
professional O
but O
are O
n't O
really O
, O
but O
this O
hair O
dryer O
gives O
the O
look O
, O
feel O
and O
performance O
of O
a O
professional O
tool O
. O
It O
comes O
nicely O
packaged O
in O
a O
sturdy O
box O
and O
the O
dryer O
itself O
has O
a O
great O
looking O
sleek O
design O
. O
It O
has O
a O
thick O
long O
cord O
. O
It O
dries O
hair O
so O
much O
faster O
than O
what O
i O
have O

Love O
this O
hairdryer O
! O
I O
have O
very O
thick O
hair O
and O
lots O
of O
it O
so O
it O
takes O
a O
long O
time O
to O
dry O
. O
But O
it O
takes O
less O
than O
five O
minutes O
with O
this O
hairdryer O
. O
There O
's O
one O
attachment O
that O
comes O
with O
it O
which O
diffuses O
the O
air O
wide O
and O
i O
use O
it O
to O
give O
more O
volume O
. O
I O
realized O
how O
miserable O
my O
drying O
experience O
was O
before O
this O
purchase O
. O
Well O
deserve O
5 O
star O
rating O
! O

I O
bought O
this O
hair O
dryer O
because O
I O
wanted O
a O
cooler O
setting O
for O
drying O
my O
hair O
without O
holding O
down O
a O
cool O
setting O
and O
trying O
to O
manipulate O
the O
dryer O
on O
my O
hair O
. O
This O
dryer O
does O
an O
amazing O
job O
in O
drying O
my O
hair O
without O
the O
damage O
that O
hot O
air O
does O
to O
my O
hair O
. O
Cool O
air O
actually O
makes O
hair O
appear O
shiny O
and O
closes O
the O
follicles O
making O
the O
hair O
seem O
healthier O
. O

super O
fast O
hair O
drying O
time O
without O
the O
frizz O
! O
  O
So O
much O
better O
than O
the O
dept O
store O
options O
for O
the O
same O
price O
or O
even O
more O
... O
very O
happy O

I O
bought O
this O
hairdryer O
... O
twice O
... O
for O
the O
retractable O
cord O
. O
  O
On O
the O
  O
first O
one O
I O
received O
the O
cord O
didn'tretract O
at O
all O
so O
I O
returned O
it O
and O
asked O
for O
a O
replacement O
. O
I O
  O
figured O
it O
was O
a O
fluke O
. O
Replacement O
was O
only O
slightly O
better O
. O
Cord O
retraction O
was O
rough O
and O
sporactic O
. O
So O
I O
returned O
for O
a O
refund O
. O
Amazon O
arranged O
for O
the O
free O
return O
and O
pickup O
of O
both O
hair O
dryers O
. O
So O
I O
may O
have O
unhappy O
with O
the O
purchases O
but O
the O
return O
process O
was O
a O
very O
good O
experience O
! O
It O
is O
just O
a O
defective O
design O
... O
My O
husband O
picked O
up O
one O
at O
Target O
and O
the O
retractable O
cord O
did O
n't O
work O
on O
it O
either O
! O

Great O
item O
. O
  O
Lightweight O
. O
  O
Very O
effective O
at O
drying O
the O
hair O
. O
  O
Highly O
recommend O
! O

I O
spent O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
researching O
various O
dryers O
and O
was O
willing O
to O
pay O
around O
$ O
100 O
to O
get O
a O
good O
one O
. O
  O
I O
was O
intrigued O
by O
this O
dryer O
because O
of O
the O
Tourmaline O
, O
Ceramic O
and O
promise O
to O
boost O
shine O
. O
  O
I O
was O
also O
drawn O
to O
this O
particular O
diffuser O
because O
of O
the O
long O
prongs O
. O
  O
I O
was O
turned O
off O
by O
the O
low O
price O
because O
I O
assumed O
it O
would O
be O
poor O
quality O
. O
  O
I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
by O
the O
quality O
. O
  O
The O
dryer O
is O
light O
weight O
, O
quieter O
than O
my O
former O
dryer O
and O
much O
more O
efficient O
. O
  O
I O
have O
long O
, O
curly O
and O
very O
thick O
hair O
. O
  O
This O
dries O
my O
entire O
head O
in O
15 O
minutes O
without O
burning O
my O
hair O
. O
  O
My O
former O
dryer O
took O
30 O
to O
35 O
minutes O
and O
did O
n't O
give O
me O
the O
shine O
this O
one O
does O
. O

[ O
[ O
VIDEOID O
: O
e5ff7a1f6cf2306e1ed10662c3a2720f]]My O
hair O
is O
so O
thick O
it O
used O
to O
take O
me O
almost O
30 O
minutes O
to O
dry O
it O
even O
with O
the O
use O
of O
a O
hair O
dryer O
, O
until O
I O
used O
this O
professional O
ionic O
hair O
dryer O
! O
I O
love O
the O
precision O
the O
concentrator O
nozzle O
provides O
; O
allowing O
me O
to O
focus O
the O
heat O
exactly O
where O
I O
need O
it O
the O
most O
. O
This O
allows O
my O
hair O
to O
dry O
much O
faster O
since O
all O
the O
air O
is O
going O
directly O
where O
the O
hair O
is O
still O
wet O
. O
The O
nozzle O
is O
easy O
to O
attach O
just O
by O
pushing O
it O
on O
the O
hair O
dryer O
when O
it O
is O
powered O
OFF.The O
hair O
dryer O
has O
( O
2 O
) O
speed O
settings O
and O
( O
3 O
) O
heat O
settings O
, O
so O
if O
my O
niece O
wanted O
to O
use O
this O
she O
could O
* O
she O
has O
really O
thin O
hair O
so O
she O
does O
n't O
need O
a O
high O
setting O
, O
or O
much O
heat* O
... O
I O
love O
the O
cold O
shot O
button O
, O
I O
use O
a O
big O
round O
brush O
to O
give O
a O
little O
curl O
on O
my O
bangs O
.. O
I O
hold O
the O
brush O
in O
place O
; O
use O
the O
heat O
to O
give O
a O
shine O
and O
volume O
to O
my O
bangs O
and O
then O
I O
do O
a O
cold O
shot O
for O
a O
minute O
to O
lock O
in O
the O
look O
, O
sometimes O
adding O
a O
little O
hair O
spray O
before O
I O
use O
the O
cold O
shot O
.. O
it O
works O
perfectly!I O
love O
the O
hook O
being O
attached O
to O
the O
hair O
dryer O
so O
I O
can O
hang O
it O
up O
when O
I O
am O
not O
using O
it O
.. O
less O
clutter O
on O
my O
bathroom O
sink O
! O
This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
well O
made O
and O
absolutely O
my O
favorite O
one O
I O
have O
ever O
used O
. O
The O
cord O
is O
thick O
and O
sturdy O
which O
is O
great O
because O
it O
will O
not O
break O
as O
easily O
. O
I O
was O
provided O
a O
sample O
for O
evaluation O
and O
review O

Good O
, O
compact O
hairdryer O

  O
Looks O
nice O
and O
works O
well O
. O
  O
I O
have O
short O
hair O
so O
set O
it O
on O
the O
lower O
volume O
. O
  O
Also O
, O
hardwired O
it O
to O
an O
outlet O
. O
  O
What O
I O
do O
not O
like O
about O
it O
is O
the O
night O
light O
. O
  O
It O
's O
too O
bright O
. O
  O
I O
think O
I O
am O
going O
to O
disable O
it O
. O

Great O
hair O
dryer O
, O
light O
- O
weight O
& O
easy O
to O
hold O
. O
My O
one O
complaint O
is O
that O
the O
diffuser O
was O
quite O
difficult O
to O
attach O
& O
the O
instructions O
did O
not O
mention O
how O
to O
attach O
it O
. O
I O
had O
to O
read O
other O
reviewer O
comments O
for O
advice O
. O

i O
bought O
this O
item O
and O
got O
it O
today O
and O
i O
did O
my O
rollers O
and O
all O
and O
i O
just O
loveeee O
the O
way O
it O
works O
! O
its O
small O
& O
the O
hood O
is O
really O
big O
to O
put O
rollers O
. O
i O
feel O
like O
i O
just O
came O
out O
of O
the O
salon O
. O
money O
well O
spent O
! O

This O
is O
a O
great O
little O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
I O
  O
have O
chin O
length O
hair O
and O
it O
was O
perfect O
. O
  O
There O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
air O
coming O
out O
! O
! O
It O
comes O
with O
a O
little O
carry O
case O
, O
and O
several O
min O
- O
attachments O
. O
Very O
light O
weight O
. O
  O
It O
only O
has O
a O
high O
and O
a O
low O
setting O
- O
so O
there O
is O
no O
real O
temp O
control O
. O

It O
is O
a O
good O
feel O
in O
my O
hand O
, O
and O
I O
suffer O
from O
carpel O
tunnel O
syndrome O
. O
I O
can O
hold O
it O
with O
a O
solid O
grip O
. O
The O
one O
reason O
it O
is O
not O
five O
stars O
for O
me O
is O
the O
cord O
. O
Although O
the O
angle O
of O
it O
looks O
like O
a O
good O
idea O
, O
it O
can O
sometimes O
get O
in O
my O
way O
when O
I O
am O
trying O
to O
work O
with O
a O
round O
brush O
on O
the O
back O
of O
my O
head O
. O
However O
, O
  O
I O
am O
very O
satisfied O
with O
my O
purchase O
, O
because O
the O
heat O
options O
, O
air O
flow O
settings O
, O
weight O
, O
sound O
, O
and O
looks O
are O
all O
attractive O
and O
smooth O
. O
It O
has O
not O
smoked O
, O
over O
- O
heated O
, O
or O
gotten O
too O
heavy O
while O
I O
have O
been O
using O
it O
. O
I O
can O
have O
it O
on O
and O
my O
boyfriend O
can O
still O
sleep O
in O
the O
bed O
, O
with O
a O
closed O
door O
as O
the O
only O
seperation O
between O
us O
. O
Arguably O
, O
he O
is O
a O
heavy O
sleeper O
. O
Overall O
, O
I O
am O
happy O
and O
plan O
to O
use O
my O
complimentary O
discount O
code O
on O
another O
product O
from O
this O

wished O
for O

the O

I O

, O
and O
even O
harder O
to O
detach O
. O
  O
And O
this O
one O
is O
my O
fault O
- O
I O
just O
assumed O
that O
all O
dryers O
came O
with O
a O
concentrator O
, O
but O
this O
one O
does O
n't O
. O
I O
tried O
attaching O
the O
concentrator O
  O
from O
my O
Revlon O
dryer O
that O
just O
stopped O
working O
, O
and O
it O
does O
n't O
fit O
. O
( O
Should O
n't O
they O
be O
universal O
? O
) O
Unfortunately O
I O
threw O
out O
all O
the O
packaging O
after O
I O
checked O
to O
make O
sure O
it O
worked O
upon O
delivery O
. O
Otherwise O
I O
would O
return O
it O
. O

Works O
wonderful O
and O
fast O
. O
But O
the O
cold O
press O
button O
got O
unglued O
. O
Powerful O
great O
for O
gym O
. O

My O
gf O
loves O
it O
. O
She O
says O
it O
does O
no O
damage O
to O
her O
hair O
and O
she O
uses O
no O
heat O
protection O
treatment O
. O

dries O
quickly O

exact O
replacement O
for O
what O
my O
wife O
has O
used O
for O
years O

Works O
well O
and O
is O
very O
portable O
. O

Power O
and O
great O
tangle O
proof O
retractable O
cord O
. O

There O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
low O
reviews O
for O
this O
hair O
dryer O
and O
most O
are O
because O
it O
's O
loud O
. O
Yes O
, O
it O
is O
loud O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
use O
a O
hair O
dryer O
to O
style O
my O
hair O
I O
just O
want O
it O
to O
dry O
it O
as O
quickly O
as O
possible O
. O
I O
have O
long O
hair O
to O
my O
lower O
back O
, O
its O
( O
mostly O
) O
straight O
and O
very O
fine O
hair O
. O
I O
part O
my O
hair O
in O
the O
middle O
. O
Then O
turn O
it O
on O
to O
the O
highest O
speend O
and O
hot O

side O
in O
5 O
mins O
then O
my O
right O
side- O
another O
5 O
mins O
. O
This O
is O
the O
3rd O
time O
I O
've O
bought O
this O
hair O
drier O
. O
The O
1st O
one O
died O
when O
I O
dropped O
it O
. O
R.I.P. O
The O
second O
one O
just O
died O
after O
5 O
years O
... O
It O
would O
n't O
heat O
up O
. O
5 O
years O
for O
$ O
20 O
.. O
That O
's O
a O
good O
deal O
to O
me O

When O
I O
received O
this O
hair O
dryer O
in O
the O
mail O
I O
was O
so O
excited O
to O
test O
it O
out O
as O
my O
old O
hair O
dryer O
just O
crapped O
out O
the O
other O
day O
and O
I O
've O
been O
without O
a O
hair O
dryer O

! O
This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
also O
made O
of O
high O
quality O
materials O
which O
is O
a O
plus O
for O
me O
as O
It O
needs O
to O
be O
able O
to O
last O
a O
long O
time O
. O
Its O
pretty O
light O
it O
weight O
compared O
to O
my O
old O
dryer O
with O
I O
love O
so O
it O
wo O
n't O
made O
my O
wrist O
tired O
since O
I O
have O
long O
hair O
that O
normally O
takes O
a O
long O
time O
to O
dry O
I O
need O
to O
be O
able O
to O
have O
a O
dryer O
that O
light O
enough O
to O
hold O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O
This O
dryer O
includes O
a O
Concentrator O
Nozzle O
with O
I O
love O
and O
works O
amazingly O
! O
! O
This O
attachment O
is O
said O
to O
direct O
maximized O
condensed O
air O
flow O
to O
the O
area O
you O
are O
targeting O
, O
adding O
precision O
and O
focus O
while O
controlling O
frizz O
and O
style O
outcome O
which O
it O
definitely O
does O
! O
! O
It O
also O
seems O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
a O
lot O
faster O
then O
my O
old O
dry O
with O
saves O
me O
time O
! O
! O
  O
It O
also O
has O
a O
2 O
speed O
settings O
and O
3 O
heat O
setting O
which O
  O
work O
wonders O

are O
a O
great O
feature O
to O
have O

! O
  O
I O
am O
really O
impressed O
with O
this O

definitely O
would O
recommend O
this O
Hair O
Dryer O
by O
Xtava O

brand O
to O
everyone O
! O
! O
I O
was O
so O
excited O
to O
receive O
this O
hair O
dryer O
from O
the O
company O
to O
test O
and O
share O
my O
opinion O
! O
! O

Great O
blow O
dryer O
. O

Plastic O
junk O
. O
  O
The O
speed O
and O
heat O
setting O
buttons O
are O
flimsy O
and O
hard O
to O
operate O
. O
Also O
the O
smell O
of O
the O
motor O
is O
awful O
. O
  O
On O
most O
dryers O
the O
smell O
abates O
after O
a O
few O
uses O
. O
  O
This O
one O
smells O
as O
if O
it O
's O
burning O
. O

I O
love O
it O
, O
of O
course O
my O
husband O
used O
it O
before O
I O
did O
. O
  O
It O
does O
not O
burn O
me O
like O
other O
hair O
dryers O
, O
it O
does O
not O
frizz O
my O
thin O
hair O
. O

Works O
Great O
! O
! O
I O
purchased O
this O
for O
my O
teenage O
daughter O
. O
She O
absolutely O
loves O
it O
:) O

WAY O
TOO O
LOUD O
. O
Cord O
keeper O
is O
a O
nice O
touch O
but O
returned O
it O
to O
prevent O
hearing O
loss O
. O
Going O
back O
to O
using O
a O
hair O
band O
for O
the O
cord O
. O

A O
great O
hairdryer O
. O
It O
seems O
to O
get O
my O
hair O
dryer O
faster O
than O
ones O
I O
've O
used O
in O
the O
past O
. O
The O
color O
is O
pretty O
too O
. O

This O
blow O
dryer O
works O
great O
. O
  O
It O
never O
frizzes O
my O
hair O
and O
the O
temperature O
control O
settings O
are O
really O
nice O
! O
It O
is O
not O
too O
heavy O
and O
I O
can O
easily O
dry O
my O
long O
hair O
without O
getting O
a O
workout O
! O
I O
also O
really O
enjoy O
the O
color O
. O
Awesome O
product O
! O

A O
far O
cry O
from O
the O
Remington O
hairdryer O
I O
have O
had O
for O
10 O
years O
but O
an O
acceptable O
backup O
. O
  O
The O
diffuser O
is O
crap O
and O
the O
fan O
speed O
and O
heat O
settings O
are O
way O
too O
slow O
/ O
low O
to O
dry O
as O
quickly O
as O
my O
previous O
dryer O
. O
  O
Another O
hairdryer O
to O
add O
to O
the O
collection O
bin O
. O

This O
dryer O
replaced O
our O
old O
one O
, O
which O
finally O
gave O
up O
the O
ghost O
. O
  O
It O
is O
powerful O
and O
easy O
to O
control O
with O
the O
dual O
thumb O
- O
controlled O
switch O
which O
regulates O
heat O
and O
fan O
speed O
. O

I O
had O
to O
send O
this O
product O
back O
because O
the O
heat O
holes O
in O
the O
dryer O
head O
are O
to O
high O
to O
dry O
the O
back O
and O
sides O
of O
my O
head O
. O

I O
always O
come O
back O
to O
this O
model O
of O
hairdryer O
! O
  O
I O
've O
had O
a O
couple O
of O
these O
hair O
dryers O
over O
the O
years O
and O
I O
love O
them O
! O
  O
They O
last O
a O
long O
time O
, O
they O
are O
lightweight O
, O
the O
buttons O
are O
easy O
to O
use O
along O
with O
the O
cold O
shot O
button O
and O
they O
dry O
my O
hair O
quickly O
! O
  O
I O
've O
tried O
other O
hair O
dryers O
from O
Conair O
and O
returned O
them O
because O
they O
just O
did O
n't O
perform O
as O
well O
for O
styling O
my O
hair O
while O
blow O
drying O
. O
  O
The O
last O
model O
I O
tried O
was O
the O
Conair O
Infinity O
Pro O
which O
is O
twice O
the O
price O
of O
this O
model O
. O
  O
The O
nozzle O
WITHOUT O
the O
attachments O
was O
too O
narrow O
so O
I O
could O
n't O
style O
my O
hair O
well O
plus O
it O
was O
very O
heavy O
! O
  O
I O
returned O
that O
one O
the O
same O
day O
and O
went O
back O
to O
this O
model O
because O
it O
has O
always O
worked O
well O
for O
me O
! O
  O
I O
wo O
n't O
stray O
again O
. O
  O
I O
actually O
purchased O
three O
of O
these O
since O
I O
noticed O
that O
now O
their O
is O
a O
new O
model O
of O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
I O
would O
REALLY O
miss O
this O
one O
if O
they O
discontinued O
it O
! O
  O
Since O
these O
last O
a O
long O
time O
, O
I O
should O
be O
set O
for O
hair O
dryers O
now O
! O
  O
:) O
  O
It O
's O
a O
great O
performing O
hairdryer O
and O
the O
price O
is O
perfect O
! O

They O
get O
very O
hot O
, O
love O
them O
. O

Very O
pleased O
. O

Works O
well O
. O
I O
have O
thin O
hair O
and O
it O
dries O
it O
quickly O
but O
I O
have O
body O
! O

Funky O
wild O
color O
and O
works O
great O
on O
my O
curls O
! O

This O
hairdryer O
worked O
OK O
for O
me O
but O
did O
not O
last O
too O
long O
. O
  O
It O
runs O
very O
hot O
on O
the O
high O
setting O
; O
I O
sometimes O
worried O
it O
might O
explode O
because O
it O
was O
soooooo O
hot O
. O
  O
Therefore O
, O
I O
mostly O
used O
the O
2 O
lower O
settings O
. O
  O
One O
day O
, O
it O
quit O
altogether O
. O
  O
The O
one O
good O
thing O
about O
it O
: O
it O
was O
quieter O
than O
any O
other O
hairdryer O
I O
've O
ever O
owned O
. O

This O
is O
the O
best O
hair O
dryer O
I O
have O
used O
in O
a O
long O
time O
. O
It O
's O
lightweight O
, O
easy O
to O
handle O
, O
and O
not O
bulky O
at O
all O
. O
It O
also O
is O
high O
- O
powered O
and O
dries O
my O
hair O
is O
less O
time O
than O
the O
dryer O
I O
was O
previously O
using O
. O
As O
someone O
with O
thick O
hair O
that O
is O
used O
to O
spending O
tons O
of O
time O
just O
drying O
my O
hair O
, O
this O
is O
a O
huge O
plus O
. O
The O
black O
color O
of O
the O
dryer O
is O
also O
sleek O
, O
and O
I O
like O
that O
it O
comes O
with O
the O
concentrator O
attachment O
. O
Product O
provided O
to O
facilitate O
this O
review O
, O
but O
all O
opinions O
are O
honest O
and O
my O
own O
. O

Good O

bought O
this O
for O
my O
daughter O
she O
has O
no O
complaints O

very O
strong O
and O
powerful O
hair O
dryer O
. O
a O
little O
bit O
heavy O
, O
but O
i O
do O

Until O

dryer O
. O
It O
is O
AMAZING O

takes O
30 O
- O
45 O
minutes O

to O
be O
somewhat O
dry O
-but O
not O

15 O
minutes O

Save O
yourself O
time O
and O
money O

buy O
another O

LOVE O
THIS O
! O
I O
have O
4c O
hair O
with O
a O
tendency O
to O
shrink O
almost O
75 O
% O
! O
This O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
! O
I O
also O
use O
this O
on O
my O
three O
daughters O
' O
hair O
, O
we O
all O
have O
4a-4c O
with O
high O
shrinkage O
, O
and O
this O
is O
one O
tough O
dryer O
! O
The O
attachments O
hold O
on O
for O
dear O
life O
and O
still O
have O
not O
broken O
! O

Love O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
really O
is O
hands O
- O
free O
, O
but O
it O
is O
quite O
a O
monstrosity O
! O
It O
took O
me O
awhile O
to O
find O
the O
correct O
height O
that O
I O
wanted O
it O
and O
the O
right O
bend O
, O
so O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
have O
to O
leave O
it O
up O
. O
Thank O
goodness O
it O
's O
not O
in O
my O
way O
TOO O
much O
, O
but O
it O
certainly O
is O
an O
eyesore O
. O

Very O
nice O
, O
lightweight O
, O
seems O
to O
dry O
hair O
quickly O
without O
frying O
it O
. O
so O
far O
very O
nice O
, O
but O
time O
will O
tell O
how O
long O
it O
will O
last O
. O
great O
value O
so O
far O
. O

i O
am O
completely O
satisfied O
, O
i O
have O
a O
long O
, O
strong O
, O
thick O
hair O
, O
and O
it O
works O
for O
me O
as O
good O
as O
  O
the O
proffessional O
blowers O
i O
used O
to O
have O
. O
I O
just O
hope O
it O
last O
. O
I O
like O
it O
very O
much O
. O
Good O
price O
, O
very O
light O
, O
even O
the O
colors O
of O
this O
hair O
blower O
are O
nice O
and O
they O
delivered O
on O
time O
. O
Thanks O
. O

One O
of O
the O
best O
dryer O
for O
this O
price O
range O
. O
I O
like O
cold O
wave O
. O

My O
second O
one O
. O
Love O
it O
but O
only O
hope O
it O
lasts O
a O
lot O
longer O
than O
the O
first O
one O
I O
bought O
. O
First O
one O
slowly O
died O
. O
Started O
to O
shut O
off O
sooner O
and O
sooner O
during O
dryings O
. O
Took O
it O
apart O
and O
found O
that O
the O
fan O
was O
rubbing O
on O
the O
housing O
inside O
and O
wore O
and O
cracked O
the O
fan O
. O
Became O
unbalanced O
inside O
and O
the O
fan O
speed O
slowed O
down O
causing O
it O
to O
overheat O
and O
shut O
down O
constantly O
. O
  O
If O
I O
could O
have O
bought O
a O
new O
fan O
blade O
I O
could O
have O
fixed O
it O
. O

Very O
satisfied O
. O
Works O
great O
for O
frizz O
control O
. O

U O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O

I O
like O
it O
. O

I O
agree O
with O
the O
other O
comments- O
I O
love O
how O
compact O
it O
is O
but O
was O
very O
disappointed O
with O
how O
heavy O
it O
is O
. O
It O
arrived O
in O
the O
original O
package O
but O
looked O
used O
. O
The O
dryer O
was O
just O
thrown O
in O
there O
without O
additional O
packaging O
. O
It O
also O
has O
a O
strong O
burning O
smell O
when O
drying O
that O
maybe O
wears O
away O
with O
more O
use O
. O
Lastly O
, O
do O
not O
buy O
if O
you O
are O
a O
Lefty O
. O
Just O
holding O
it O
I O
was O
able O
to O
switch O
the O
settings O
while O
drying O
my O
hair O
:( O

This O
is O
a O
really O
wonderful O
blow O

the O
time O

to O
dry O

half O
! O
It O
was O
really O
lightweight O
and O
has O
a O
very O
sleek O
design O
. O
It O
comes O
with O
a O
removeable O
nozzle O
that O
centralizes O
  O
the O
heat O
that O
I O

Very O
happy O
w O
this O
ourchase O

My O
hairdryer O
is O
so O
old O
I O
think O
it O
has O
lost O
all O
its O
power O
so O
I O
stopped O
using O
it O
. O
  O
I O
saw O
a O
great O
promotion O
for O
this O
item O
and O
figured O
it O
was O
high O
time O
I O
got O
a O
new O
one O
! O
  O
As O
soon O
as O
it O
arrived O
this O
morning O
I O
jumped O
in O
the O
shower O
to O
wash O
my O
hair O
and O
used O
it O
and O
oh.em.geeeee O
it O
is O
great O
! O
  O
I O
have O
really O
curly O
hair O
( O
spiral O
curls O
in O
the O
back O
and O
looser O
curls O
up O
top O
) O
and O
the O
air O
director O
thingy O
( O
that O
is O
a O
technical O
term O
! O
) O
is O
so O
great O
! O
  O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
to O
use O
  O
a O
lot O
of O
product O
in O
my O
hair O
but O
hate O
frizz- O
this O
seemed O
to O
seal O
the O
deal O
without O
having O
to O
use O
so O
much O
product O
my O
hair O
felt O
crunchy O
. O
  O
Today O
I O
have O
soft O
, O
bouncy O
, O
frizz O
free O
curls O
! O
! O
! O
  O
Now O
I O
need O
a O
new O
camera O
so O
I O
can O
show O
them O
off O
! O

Works O
great O
! O

I O
've O
been O
using O
this O
for O
about O
a O
week O
now O
. O
I O
previously O
had O
a O
Revlon O
with O
retractable O
cord O
that O
still O
worked O
, O
but O
it O
was O
REALLY O
hot O
. O
I O
have O
oily O
hair O
, O
so O
I O
have O
to O
wash O
it O
pretty O
much O
daily O
. O
The O
heat O
was O
killing O
my O
long O
hair O
. O
I O
took O
a O
chance O
on O
this O
and O
I O
am O
really O
glad O
I O
did O
. O
Initially O
, O
I O
was O
disappointed O
, O
but O
I O
am O
glad O
I O
stuck O
with O
it.1 O
) O
Power O
! O
It O
has O
almost O
too O
much O
power O
for O
someone O
with O
long O
hair O
, O
my O
hair O
was O
FLYING O
all O
over O
the O
place O
( O
it O
also O
tangles O
easily O
) O
. O
I O
added O
one O
of O
the O
3 O
concentration O
nozzles O
and O
that O
really O
helped.2 O
) O
Heat O
! O
Yes O
, O
its O
not O
super O
hot O
-- O
but O
heat O
is O
n't O
good O
either O
! O
It O
does O
start O
off O
rather O
cool O
, O
but O
it O
always O
heats O
up O
more O
about O
30 O
- O
60 O
seconds O
into O
blow O
drying O
. O
With O
as O
much O
power O
going O
through O
it O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
you O
need O
as O
much O
heat O
to O
accomplish O
getting O
dry O
hair.3 O
) O
Buttons O
! O
Yes O
, O
the O
buttons O
are O
on O
the O
side O
. O
I O
think O
the O
reason O
most O
people O
complain O
about O
button O
placement O
is O
because O
they O
are O
so O
used O
to O
the O
position O
of O
their O
old O
hairdryers O
. O
It O
takes O
some O
time O
to O
get O
used O
to O
a O
new O
one O
. O
I O
think O
people O
notice O
the O
difference O
a O
lot O
at O
first O
, O
but O
it O
really O
will O
go O
away O
and O
you O
'll O
get O
used O
to O
it O
. O
It O
has O
n't O
been O
an O
issue O
for O
me O
. O
Overall O
, O
I O
am O
pleased O
with O
this O
blow O
dryer O
. O
I O
ca O
n't O
say O
that O
my O
hair O
dries O
any O
faster O
than O
my O
previous O
dryer O
, O
but O
it O
will O
be O
much O
healthier O
in O
the O
long O
run O
and O
that O
's O
something O
I O
appreciate O
more O
than O
speed O
. O
It O
definitely O
does O
not O
take O
a O
long O
time O
by O
any O
means O
though O
. O
I O
am O
happy O
I O
got O
it O
! O

Great O
product O
for O
coarse O
hair O
! O
I O
have O
a O
4b O
texture O
and O
when O
I O
use O
the O
high O
setting O
with O
the O
fine O
tooth O
comb O
attachment O
, O
I O
get O
my O
hair O
very O
straight O
. O
The O
only O
reason O
why O
it O
does O
n't O
get O
a O
full O
5 O
stars O
is O
because O
of O
the O
placement O
of O
the O
cool O
button O
. O
If O
the O
button O
was O
a O
setting O
instead O
of O
at O
the O
back O
, O
the O
blow O
drier O
would O
be O
perfect O
. O

Totally O
diggin O
my O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
Gift O
from O
hubby O
! O
  O
Needed O
something O
quiet O
that O
did O
n't O
wake O
up O
the O
kids O
. O
  O
2 O
levels O
of O
speed O
( O
low O
works O
as O
well O
as O
high O

just O
more O
quiet O
) O

love O

! O

as O
advertised O

Great O
product O
. O
Fast O
shipping O
. O

Works O
great O
. O

After O
using O
the O
dryer O
twice O
my O
hair O
feels O
dry O
, O
lifeless O
, O
flat O
and O
flyaway O
. O
Maybe O
its O
the O
ionizing O
function O
of O
the O
dryer O
, O
but O
it O
really O
did O
a O
number O
on O
my O
hair O
. O
I O
've O
been O
using O
Conair O
dryers O
for O
years O
and O
years O
, O
and O
when O
my O
last O
hair O
dryer O
died O
I O
bought O
another O
Conair O
, O
thinking O
I O
'd O
get O
the O
same O
great O
dryer O
. O
In O
terms O
of O
the O
dryer O
itself O
, O
it O
is O
heavy O
, O
difficult O
to O
hold O
, O
and O
the O
cord O
is O
too O
short O
( O
especially O
if O
you O
have O
long O
hair O
and O
attempt O
to O
style O
using O
a O
brush O
) O
. O
Due O
to O
the O
weight O
and O
the O
oddly O
shaped O
handle O
, O
I O
found O
it O
very O
awkward O
to O
use O
. O
The O
buttons O
that O
control O
the O
heat O
/ O
speed O
are O
also O
located O
in O
an O
inconvenient O
spot O
on O
the O
handle O
, O
and O
they O
are O
sharp O
on O
the O
edges O
, O
which O
makes O
using O
the O
dyer O
even O
more O
uncomfortable O
. O
Unless O
you O
want O
your O
hair O
to O
be O
a O
lifeless O
dried O
- O
out O
mess O
, O
stay O
away O
from O
this O
dryer O
. O

Ok O
this O
took O
about O
10 O
; O
minutes O
off O
the O
drying O
time O
of O
my O
hair O
as O
opposed O
to O
  O
using O
just O
a O
regular O
ionic O
hair O
dryer O
, O
but O
not O
ony O
that O
it O
leaves O
my O
hair O
( O
which O
isa O
bit O
past O
  O
shoulder O

It O

a O
light O
weight O
dryer O
. O

Love O
it O
. O
Have O
very O
long O
thick O
hair O
. O
Cut O
drying O
time O
almost O
in O
half O
. O
Did O
not O
frizz O
my O
hair O
as O
other O
dryers O
have O
in O
the O
past O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
use O

I O
have O
owned O
this O
for O
a O
little O
over O
a O
year O
and O
it O
's O
been O
working O
on O
and O
off O
for O
a O
few O
months O
now O
. O
At O
first O
it O
was O
fine O
but O
I O
may O
need O
to O
replace O
it O
soon O
. O
I O
use O
this O
about O
1 O
- O
2 O
times O
a O
week O
. O
Longer O
when O
it O
worked O
for O
winter O
. O

This O
works O
well O
and O
is O
easy O
to O
use O
, O
the O
cord O
from O
the O
base O
to O
the O
drier O
could O
be O
a O
little O
longer O

Present O
for O
my O
mom O
and O
it O
's O
very O
good O
quality O
for O
price O
. O

I O
'm O
so O
excited O
when O
I O
receive O
this O
item O
, O
and O
ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
try O
it O
. O
The O
product O
was O
shipped O
from O
Japan O
and O
took O
about O
20 O
days O
to O
be O
delivered O
. O

This O
dryer O
has O
great O
Hot O
/ O
Warm O
/ O
Cold O
settings O
and O
makes O
my O
hair O
shiny O
and O
not O
too O
dried O
out O
. O
The O
only O
reason O
I O
'm O
giving O
it O
4 O
stars O
is O
because O
the O
switch O
to O
adjust O
the O
settings O
is O
difficult O
to O
push O
. O

I O
have O
always O
loved O
the O
andis O
hairdryer O
but O
paid O
thirty O
some O
dollars O
for O
this O
and O
it O
only O
lasted O
couple O
months O
the O
switch O
quit O
working O
and O
the O
dryer O
would O
get O
so O
hot O
would O
shut O
off O
before O
could O
get O
my O
hair O
dry O

Nice O
hair O
dryer O
for O
everyday O
& O
travel O
. O
Has O
on O
- O
going O
problems O
with O
the O
retractable O
cord O
. O

This O
is O
AMAZING O
! O
  O
Dries O
my O
hair O
very O
fast O
and O
it O
's O
so O
shiny O
when O
I O
'm O
done O
. O
  O
The O
only O
negative O
is O
that O
it O
's O
pretty O
heavy O
, O
but O
I O
'll O
just O
chalk O
that O
up O
to O
an O
arm O
workout O
! O
  O
:) O

Very O
lightweight O
, O
so O
great O
for O
long O
uses O
. O

Light O
weight O
yet O
dries O
hair O
fast O

Has O
a O
110 O
or O
220 O
setting O
so O
it O
's O
perfect O
for O
worldwide O
travel O
. O
Works O
with O
a O
plug O
adapter O
. O
No O
converter O
needed O
. O

Broke O
after O
a O
month O
and O
a O
half O
:( O

Nice O
and O
compact O
. O
It O
's O
a O
bit O
noisy O
, O
but O
I O
think O
that O
's O
a O
function O
of O
its O
size O
. O
The O
cord O
and O
plug O
are O
not O
as O
large O
as O
some O
, O
so O
it O
's O
footprint O
is O
small O
, O
which O
is O
exactly O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
to O
travel O
to O
the O
UK O
. O
It O
's O
not O
lighter O
than O
my O
larger O
one O
but O
it O
will O
work O
just O
fine O
. O

Dries O
my O
super O
thick O

  O
The O
bonnet O
is O
small O
where O
it O
fits O
around O
the O
head O
. O
Placing O
a O
snall O

near O
the O
brow O
makes O
it O
more O
comfortable O
. O
Also O
restringing O
it O
so O
it O
fits O
an O
adult O
head O

  O
The O
bonnet O
smells O
like O
plastic O
for O
several O
uses O

but O
now O
smells O
better O
after O
I O
took O
it O
out O
and O
let O
it O
sit O
without O
being O
folded O
up O
in O
the O
case O
. O
  O
Good O

I O

my O

Absolutely O
loved O
it O
. O
  O
Until O
it O
quit O
working O
. O
  O
After O
six O
weeks O
the O
low O
setting O
was O
just O
a O
slight O
puff O
of O
wind O
. O
  O
The O
high O
setting O
then O
had O
as O
much O
power O
as O
the O
low O
setting O
had O
previously O
when O
it O
was O
working O
properly O
. O
  O
At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
hot O
setting O
became O
so O
incredibly O
hot O
that O
the O
coils O
inside O
glowed O
bright O
orange O
. O
  O
So O
I O
started O
using O
the O
warm O
setting O
. O
  O
It O
's O
now O
completely O
worthless O

only O
takes O
about O
10 O
min O
to O
dry O
it O

I O
used O
to O

25 O
min O
just O
drying O
my O
hair O
and O
another O
15 O
min O
styling O
it O

I O
've O

powerful O
, O
sturdy O
, O
leaves O
hair O
soft O
, O
dries O
quickly O
, O
not O
too O
loud O
, O
and O
aesthetically O
pleasing O
. O
No O
breakage O
. O
Satisfied O
with O
the O
results O
. O
Attachments O
work O
well O
. O
i O
received O
a O
free O
sample O
in O
exchange O
of O
my O
honest O
opinion O
. O

Third O
time O
is O
a O
charm O
! O
  O
I O
was O
looking O
to O
replace O
my O
hair O
dryer O
and O
the O
last O
two O
I O
tried O
were O
so O
loud O
. O
  O
This O
one O
is O
great O
! O
Yay O
! O

works O
excellent O

I O
bought O
this O
to O
use O
when O
travelling O
because O
of O
it O
's O
compact O
size O
. O
But O
it O
works O
so O
well O
I O
've O
been O
using O
it O
everyday O
. O
  O
The O
cord O
stores O
easily O
inside O
the O
  O
handle O
and O
the O
temperature O
is O
perfect O
-- O
not O
too O
hot O
and O
not O
too O
cool O
. O
I O
added O
the O
attachment O
and O
found O
it O
performs O
better O
with O
it O
on O
. O
Has O
great O
power O
and O
does O
n't O
make O
my O
hair O
frizzy O
or O
staticy O
. O
The O
only O
complaint O
I O
have O
is O
the O
strong O
plastic O
smell O
when O
I O
first O
opened O
the O
box O
. O
I O
've O
used O
it O
for O
a O
week O
now O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
smell O
it O
anymore O
. O
I O
really O
do O
love O
this O
hairdryer O
. O

love O
it O
! O

New O
to O
hair O
dryers O
but O
does O
everything O
it O
should O
and O
a O
bit O
more O
. O

works O
great O
, O
looks O
cool O

I O
have O
owned O
a O
couple O
of O
these O
hairdryers O
. O
  O
They O
work O
great O
for O
3 O
- O
4 O
years O
before O
they O
get O
noisy O
. O
  O
For O
the O
cost O
and O
the O
convenience O
it O
can O
not O
be O
beat O
. O

Worth O
it O
! O
I O
'm O
so O
glad O
I O
listened O
to O
my O
hairdresser O
when O
he O
recommended O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
Obviously O
, O
he O
uses O
his O
multiple O
times O
each O
day O
and O
his O
lasts O
for O
years O
. O
It O
really O
did O
cut O
down O
my O
drying O
time O
. O
Only O
negative O
is O
the O
weight O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
mind O
it O
as O
I O
'm O
using O
it O
- O
it O
's O
an O
other O
arm O
workout O
:) O
it O
's O
when O
I O
travel O
with O
it O
that O
makes O
me O
wish O
it O
was O
lighter O
. O
I O
'm O
always O
to O
the O
weight O
limit O
on O
my O
checked O
bags O
so O
this O
goes O
into O
my O
carry O
on O
and O
it O
's O
another O
workout O
! O
Still O
love O
it O
and O
would O
recommend O
it O
. O

mi O

This O
dryer O
BY O
FAR O
IS O
THE O
BEST O
EVER O
! O
! O
! O
! O
I O
have O
really O
long O
hair O
extensions O
and O
they O
take O
FOREVER O
to O
dry O
, O
and O
after O
reading O
the O
reviews O
for O
this O
dryer O
I O
decided O
to O
try O
it O
because O
they O
say O
drying O
in O
half O
the O
time O
. O
They O
were O
n't O
kidding O
, O
this O
dryer O
is O
AMAZING O
to O
say O
the O
least O
, O
I O
have O
never O
owned O
such O
a O
great O
product O
that O
is O
so O
inexpensive O
; O
so O
do O
yourself O
a O
favor O
, O
purchase O
this O
dryer O
, O
you O
wo O
nt O
be O
sorry O
, O
it O
is O
truly O
the O
best O
! O
Even O
on O
cool O
or O
medium O
speed O
this O
thing O
is O
magnificent O
! O
Some O
of O
the O
reviews O
comment O
on O
this O
dryer O
being O
heavy O
, O
I O
'll O
share O
a O
secret O
... O
cheap O
dryers O
are O
superlight O
weight O
, O
but O
in O
all O
sincerity O
, O
this O
dryer O
is O
not O
heavy O
at O
all O
, O
so O
not O
sure O
why O
some O
reviews O
say O
this O
. O
The O
button O
placement O
was O
an O
issue O
when O
I O
read O
the O
reviews O
but O
decided O
to O
try O
it O
for O
myself O
, O
and O
what O
I O
personally O
found O
was O
, O
where O
I O
place O
my O
hand O
is O
at O
the O
bottom O
anyways O
, O
so O
it O
was O
a O
non O
issue O
for O
me O
. O
It O
's O
totally O
worth O
trying O
because O
everyone O
is O
going O
to O
hold O
their O
dryer O
in O
a O
different O
spot O
anyways O
, O
and O
if O
I O
did O
n't O
purchase O
this O
based O
on O
what O
others O
said O
about O
weight O
and O
button O
placement O
, O
I O
would O
have O
missed O
out O
on O
the O
BEST O
DRYER O
EVER O
, O
and O
believe O
me O
, O
I O
have O
tried O
them O
all O
. O
And O
side O
note O
, O
it O
really O
does O
dry O
in O
half O
the O
time O
, O
which O
means O
an O
extra O
20 O
mins O
in O
the O
morning O
hitting O
the O
snooze O
button O
; O
) O

Works O
good O
. O

This O
thing O
has O
almost O
as O
much O
hot O
air O
as O
a O
politician O
! O
With O
adjustable O
temperature O
settings O
, O
variable O
wind O
intensity O
and O
an O
off O
switch O
, O
this O
thing O
is O
20 O
times O
more O
responsive O
than O
any O
political O
figure O
currently O
in O
office O
. O
Temperature O
variations O
are O
modest O
, O
little O
chance O
of O
frying O
your O
skin O
. O
Controls O
are O
a O
little O
cumbersome O
/ O
awkward O
but O
it O
works O
, O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
usually O
need O
to O
shift O
around O
much O
during O
drying O
incidents O
. O
Air O
power O
is O
effective O
, O
if O
not O
stunning O
. O
Good O
for O
drying O
hair O
, O
not O
good O
for O
blowing O
large O
spiders O
across O
a O
tile O
floor O
( O
limited O
cord O
reach O
and O
range O
of O
power O
) O
. O
Absolutely O
terrible O
for O
flying O
kites O
with O
small O
dogs O
attached O
. O
I O
think O
maybe O
I O
'd O
enjoy O
seeing O
a O
laser O
sight O
attachment O
so O
I O
can O
focus O
drying O
power O
on O
specific O
strands O
of O
troublesome O
hair O
... O
but O
we O
do O
n't O
always O
get O
everything O
we O
want O
. O

cord O
does O
not O
retract O
majority O
of O
the O
time O

I O
researched O
a O
LOT O
of O
hair O
dryers O
, O
wanting O
one O
that O
was O
n't O
too O
noisy O
and O
that O
had O
BOTH O
temperature O
and O
fan O
settings-- O
Found O
it O
! O
! O
This O
is O
the O
one O
! O
! O
It O
was O
n't O
as O
expensive O
as O
some O
that O
just O
seemed O
like O
more O
than O
I O
needed O
. O
It O
does O
the O
job O
I O
need O
it O
to O
, O
in O
a O
short O
amount O
of O
time O
, O
w/o O
frying O
my O
hair O
! O
  O
It O
's O
not O
the O
Large O
size O
so O
it O
fits O
easily O
in O
my O
suitcase O
and O
travels O
well O
. O
I O
love O
the O
matte O
finish O
, O
which O
keeps O
it O
from O
sliding O
off O
the O
counter-- O
just O
feels O
solid O
in O
my O
hand O
without O
being O
heavy O
! O

Bought O
for O
my O
wife O
and O
she O
loves O
it O
. O
  O
No O
complaints O

Even O
, O
fast O
drying O

Favorite O
dryer O
! O
  O
Dries O
hair O
quickly O
! O

Long O
story O
short O
.. O
I O
used O
it O
4 O
times O
and O
it O
is O
now O
dead O
. O
Cons O
: O
I O
bought O
it O
locally O
in O
late O
January O
, O
used O
it O
4 O
times O
and O
now O
it O
has O
died O
. O
When O
i O
first O
used O
it O
I O
heard O
something O
rolling O
around O
inside O
the O
unit O
while O
I O
was O
drying O
my O
hair O
. O
I O
tried O
shaking O
it O
out O
but O
got O
nothing O
. O
  O
I O
was O
pretty O
much O
expecting O
it O
to O
not O
last O
long O
at O
this O
point O
. O
I O
began O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
today O
and O
again O
heard O
the O
sound O
, O
then O
a O
loud O
Clack O
. O
The O
unit O
quit O
and O
had O
a O
burning O
smell O
. O
I O
shook O
it O
over O
the O
counter O
and O
2 O
small O
pieces O
of O
red O
plastic O
shook O
out O
of O
the O
front O
. O
Nothing O
wrong O
on O
the O
outside O
somust O
have O
either O
broke O
off O
inside O
or O
been O
left O
inside O
by O
sloppy O
workers O
. O
Pros O
: O
  O
I O
really O
wanted O
this O
machine O
to O
work O
for O
me O
so O
I O
will O
purchase O
a O
replacement O
and O
give O
it O
a O
second O
try O
, O
since O
itseemed O
defective O
right O
out O
of O
the O
box O
( O
having O
something O
rolling O
around O
in O
it.)I O
love O
the O
retractable O
cord O
. O
  O
It O
's O
only O
about O
5 O
ft O
long O
so O
could O
have O
been O
longer O
but O
was O
adequate O
. O
I O
just O
hate O
winding O
a O
cord O
around O
a O
machine O
.. O
it O
's O
messy O
.. O
the O
machine O
might O
still O
be O
hot O
etc O
. O
Yes O
of O
course O
you O
have O
to O
hold O
the O
plug O
as O
you O
retract O
it O
or O
you O
'll O
get O
wacked O
. O
It O
has O
a O
nice O
heft O
to O
it O
and O
seemed O
very O
solid O
. O
  O
Attachments O
stayed O
on O
when O
in O
use O
. O
It O
moves O
a O
Lot O
of O
air O
thru O
it O
- O
more O
than O
the O
comparabe O
Remington O
D O
3020 O
Volume O
and O
Shine O
hair O
dryer O
( O
which O
I O
also O
had O
on O
hand).I O
was O
just O
begining O
to O
compare O
the O
2 O
when O
the O
Conair O
bit O
the O
dust O
. O
This O
was O
disappointing O
after O
having O
a O
hand O
held O
unit O
that O
worked O
for O
36 O
years O
. O

Works O
great O
, O
absolutely O
love O
it O
! O

It O
's O
a O
great O
hair O
dryer O
! O
I O
love O
it O
! O

Great O
blow O
dryers O
! O

I O
really O
loved O
this O
blow O
dryer O
however O
, O
  O
I O
have O
only O
had O
it O
for O
about O
5 O
months O
and O
it O
has O
just O
stopped O
working O
. O
I O
did O
n't O
use O
it O
everyday O
either O
. O

Broke O
after O
using O
it O
for O
two O
weeks O

If O
you O
are O
purchasing O
this O
dryer O
solely O
for O
the O
cord O
retraction O
feature O
, O
you O
will O
be O
very O
disappointed O
. O
  O
Very O
seldom O
does O
the O
last O
10 O
- O
12 O
inches O
retract O
into O
the O
handle O
. O

I O
used O
this O
blow O
dryer O
while O
in O
Spain O
. O
  O
It O
worked O
wonderful O
! O

I O
loved O
this O
blow O
dryer O
.. O
:( O
but O
mine O
just O
died O
. O
I O
had O
it O
for O
almost O
4 O
years O
, O
so O
it O
was O
probably O
worth O
the O
price O
, O
but O
.. O
i O
think O
i O
'd O
rather O
get O
a O
new O
one O
that O
lasts O
longer O
. O

Can O
dry O
hair O
faster O
than O
the O
other O
of O
the O
same O
voltage O
I O
ever O
used O
. O
  O
A O
good O
compact O
hair O
dryer O
! O

Excelente O

I O
use O
this O
to O
travel O
internationally O
( O
so O
far O
just O
Denmark O
and O
Spain O
) O
and O
it O
worked O
fine O
with O
the O
European O
adapter O
. O
Just O
make O
sure O
to O
flip O
the O
little O
voltage O
switch O
before O
you O
use O
it O
! O

muy O
bueno O

/Mounted O
well O
. O
  O
Looks O
and O
works O
great O
! O

Love O
this O
quiet O
, O
efficient O
dryer O
! O
! O

The O
plug O
broke O
after O
one O
month O
. O
  O
Now O
I O
have O
to O
fiddle O
with O
the O
plug O
in O
the O
outlet O
to O
get O
it O
to O
come O
on O
, O
then O
it O
keeps O
turning O
off O
. O
  O
An O
electrician O
checked O
the O
electrical O
circuit O
, O
which O
is O
OK O
. O
It O
is O
definitely O
the O
plug O
on O
the O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
If O
I O
move O
it O
around O
in O
the O
outlet O
, O
the O
hair O
dryer O
will O
turn O
on O
and O
off O
and O
on O
... O
  O
It O
was O
a O
Christmas O
present O
I O
bought O
it O
early O
December O
, O
so O
now O
the O
return O

I O

out O
with O
the O

of O
minutes O
and O
then O

lowand O
it O
still O
dries O
nicely O
but O
does O

stress O
my O
hair O
. O
I O
have O
very O
fine O
hair O
and O
lots O
of O

not O
easy O
todry O
. O
Oh O

This O

This O
wonderful O
blower O
has O
a O
lot O
to O
do O
with O
it O
! O

This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
amazing- O
I O
just O
ordered O
another O
one O
for O
my O
daughter- O
She O
has O
super O
thick O
long O
hair O
and O
does O
n't O
like O
to O
dry O
her O
hair O
because O
it O
takes O
too O
long- O
We O
just O
tested O
this O
hair O
dryer O
and O
literally O
her O
hair O
was O
dry O
within O
10 O
minutes- O
Great O
product O
! O

My O
old O
Remington O
ProAir O
Ceramic O
just O
died O
and O
I O
purchased O
this O
as O
what O
I O
had O
hoped O
would O
be O
a O
suitable O
replacement O
. O
Not O
even O
close O
. O
The O
airflow O
is O
too O
forceful O
. O
Even O
on O
low O
this O
dryer O
whips O
my O
long O
straight O
hair O
into O
a O
tangled O
mess O
. O
The O
nozzle O
is O
too O
narrow O
so O
it O
further O
concentrates O
the O
airflow O
. O
The O
dryer O
is O
on O
the O
heavy O
side O
for O
it O
's O
compact O
size O
.. O
The O
high O
heat O
setting O
gets O
way O
too O
hot O
. O
Even O
low O
, O
once O
it O
heats O
up O
, O
seems O
excessive O
. O
It O
's O
going O
back O
. O

Product O
description O
is O
wrong O
. O
There O
is O
no O
cool O

great O
so O

Love O
this O
dryer O
... O
for O
the O
two O
levels O
of O
intensity O
no O
matter O
what O
heat O
level O
. O

I O
liked O
working O
fine O

Very O
light O
and O
has O
strong O
power O

Just O
what O
I O
wanted O

Night O
light O
was O
too O
bright O
and O
can O
not O
be O
turned O
off O
or O
down O

Nice O
& O
quiet O

it O
's O
functional O
for O
a O
20 O
dollar O
item.one O
complaint O
though O
is O
the O
burnt O
smell O
it O
gives O
off O
; O
it O
makes O
the O
product O
seem O
really O
flimsy O
and O
cheap O
and O
uncomfortable O

Works O
great O
, O
even O
with O
traveling O
a O
lot O
it O
still O
is O
n't O
too O
bulky O
. O
We O
'll O
see O
how O
long O
it O
lasts O
but O
does O
the O
trick O
. O

The O
product O
is O
great O
, O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
, O
thanks O
! O
Will O
purchase O
brand O
again O

I O
admit O
, O
I O
was O
skeptical O
about O
whether O
or O
not O
this O
dryer O
would O
really O
make O
a O
difference O
in O
how O
my O
hair O
felt O
but O
it O
did O
! O
  O
I O
have O
noticed O
that O
if O
I O
use O
aHigher O
speed O
than O
is O
recommended O
for O
my O
hair O
type O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
make O
as O
much O
of O
a O
change O
but O
if O
I O
follow O
the O
proper O
instructions O
, O
my O
hair O
is O
softAnd O
shiny O
and O
the O
results O
are O
incredible O
! O

Long O
lasting O
, O
and O
serves O
it O
purpose O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O

Great O
! O

Works O
great O
and O
keeps O
the O
vanity O
uncluttered O
. O

Very O
powerful O
. O

Excellent O
. O

Excellent O
. O
It O
's O
very O
easy O
to O
put O
together O
, O
it O
's O
not O
too O
loud O
actually O
I O
'm O
watching O
jeopardy O
while O
under O
the O
dryer O
right O
now O
! O
The O
bell O
is O
not O
too O
loud O
when O
the O
timer O
is O
done O
. O
The O
only O
annoying O
thing O
is O
you O
hear O
the O
timer O
ticking O
but O
I O
'm O
used O
to O
that O
from O
going O
to O
the O
beauty O
salon O
it O
goes O
unnoticeable O
. O
Delivery O
was O
quick O
and O
swiftly O
and O
customer O
service O
was O
excellent O
. O
My O
hair O
dried O
very O
quick O
and O
I O
did O
n't O
even O
put O
it O
on O
the O
max O
heat O
. O
I O
'm O
African O
American O
with O
shoulder O
length O
hair O
4c O
and O
I O
never O
had O
a O
perm O
. O
I O
'm O
glad O
I O
purchased O
this O
dryer O
because O
it O
is O
an O
reasonable O
price O

It O
shoots O
sparks O
fairly O
often O
. O
Kind O
of O
scary O
. O

Solid O
, O
albeit O
heavy O
. O
Great O
if O
you O
have O
shorter O
hair O
, O
but O
I O
imagine O
the O
weight O
would O
be O
kind O
of O
a O
pain O
if O
you O
had O
more O
to O
deal O
with O
. O
My O
wife O
loves O
it O
, O
though O
! O
It O
's O
hard O
to O
find O
a O
good O
retractable O
cord O
dryer O
! O

Quiet O
and O
efficient O
. O
Nice O

. O

I O
bought O
this O
dryer O
for O
my O
7 O
year O
old O
as O
her O
first O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
It O
's O
very O
small O
and O
lightweight O
so O
she O
can O
easily O
hold O
it O
. O
  O
She O
enjoys O
being O
able O
to O
dry O
her O
own O
hair O
. O

I O
love O
the O
hair O
dryer O
but O
the O
comb O
attachment O
starting O
breaking O
on O
our O
first O
use O
. O

I O
put O
these O
in O
Rv O
's O
because O
they O
fit O
in O
a O
tight O
spot O
and O
work O
well O

Great O

  O
Would O

! O
! O

This O
is O
by O
far O
my O
favorite O
dryer O
. O
I O
love O
the O
built O
in O
cord O
retractor O
, O
especially O
for O
traveling O
, O
which O
we O
do O
often O
. O
I O
have O
so O
many O
gadgets O
I O
need O
to O
bring O
, O
my O
suitcase O
is O
always O
a O
mess O
of O
cords O
. O
In O
addition O
to O
that O
, O
it O
dries O
my O
hair O
SO O
fast O
. O
I O
have O
fairly O
thick O
hair O
, O
though O
it O
's O
thinned O
over O
the O
years O
a O
bit O
, O
and O
it O
would O
take O
me O
in O
upwards O
of O
20 O
minutes O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
with O
a O
standard O
dryer O
. O
Using O
this O
dryer O
with O
a O
ceramic O
brush O
has O
my O
hair O
dry O
in O
under O
10 O
minutes O
every O
time O
. O
The O
cool O
shot O
option O
is O
great O
for O
just O
adding O
a O
bit O
of O
curl O
around O
a O
brush O
if O
you O
're O
in O
a O
hurry O
, O
too O
! O
My O
hair O
tends O
to O
get O
a O
bit O
curly O
as O
it O
dries O
, O
so O
I O
really O
like O
the O
diffuser O
attachment O
as O
well O
. O
It O
works O
perfectly O
to O
smooth O
out O
my O
hair O
without O
it O
poofing O
out O
like O
crazy O
. O
I O
still O
like O
to O
follow O
up O
with O
my O
straightener O
because O
it O
makes O
my O
hair O
really O
shine O
and O
glow O
, O
but O
the O
diffuser O
makes O
the O
job O
much O
easier O
. O
I O
've O
been O
using O
tourmaline O
ceramic O
dryers O
for O
years O
and O
I O
have O
MUCH O
less O
breakage O
and O
a O
huge O
reduction O
in O
split O
ends O
since O
making O
the O
switch O
, O
so O
at O
this O
price O
, O
this O
dryer O
/ O
styler O
is O
a O
must O
have O
! O

Item O

in O
great O
condition O
. O

Bought O
for O

  O
Must O
be O
good O
, O
she O
takes O
it O

the O
trips O

This O
is O
a O
good O
hairdryer O
for O
travel O
and O
okay O
for O
every O
day O
it O
's O
not O
the O
best O
driver O
I O
've O
ever O

That O

impressive O
for O
hai O
dryers O
and O
hair O
straighteners O
anymore O

I O
wanted O
to O
like O
this O
blow O
dryer O
more O
because O
of O
the O
reviews O
on O
it O
. O
But O
there O
just O
are O
n't O
enough O
heat O
settings O
on O
it O
, O
and O
it O
gets O
really O
hot O
, O
too O
hot O
! O
But O
the O
combs O
are O
sturdy O
, O
and O
it O
's O
serves O
it O
's O
purpose O
when O
I O
decide O
to O
use O
it O
. O
I O
switch O
up O
with O
my O
Vidal O
Sassoon O
dryer O
, O
when O
I O
need O
something O
with O
more O
alternatives O
to O
heat O
settings O
. O

Sadly O
the O
product O
broke O
the O
first O
month O
of O
use O
. O
  O
I O
would O
not O
recommend O
purchasing O

how O
I O
try O
to O
get O
it O
in O
. O
  O
Would O
return O
but O
not O
worth O
the O
time O
or O
money O
. O
  O
Do O
n't O
waste O
your O
money O

the O
money O
! O
! O
  O
So O
glad O
I O
finally O
bought O
it O
! O
! O
:) O

Not O
for O
a O
short O
nozzle O
dryer- O
it O
pops O
right O
off O
, O
but O
it O
's O
a O
good O
bowl O
and O
finger O
design O
of O
medium O
depth O
. O

Excellent O
hairdryer O

The O
hair O
dryer O
does O
well O
with O
my O
thick O
hair O
. O
good O
in O
the O
hand O
, O
the O
cord O
is O
a O
bit O
forceful O
. O
At O
times O
I O
have O
to O
pull O
it O
out O
again O
to O
get O
it O
to O
retract O
fully O
but O
this O
could O
be O
attributed O
to O
independent O
factors O
( O
angle O
of O
handle O
when O
activating O
cord O
keeper O
) O
. O
  O
Fantastic O
for O
saving O
space O
. O

Daughter O
loves O
it O
... O

Lighter O
than O
my O
previous O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
And O
it O
dries O
faster O
with O
softer O
results O
. O

Best O
I O
have O
ever O
purchased O
! O
! O
! O

I O
was O
apprehensive O
about O
buying O
this O
because O
it O
was O
more O
expensive O
then O
what O
I O
usually O
buy O
, O
but O
it O
's O
well O
worth O
it O
. O
Dries O
my O
hair O
very O
fast O
without O
a O
lot O
of O
high O
heat O
. O
We O
got O
this O
mainly O
for O
my O
husband O
because O
he O
has O
dreads O
and O
this O
was O
recommended O
to O
dry O
the O
dreads O
out O
completely O
and O
now O
both O
of O
us O
use O
it O
. O

Sunbeam O
is O
not O
worth O
a O
s O

Review O
: O
4 O
months O
after O
installing O
this O
blowdryer O
, O
it O
died O
. O
I O
was O
super O
disappointed O
given O
my O
glowing O
review O
below O
. O
I O
have O
not O
even O
contacted O
Amazon O
or O
the O
manufacturer O
since O
it O
's O
past O
the O
30 O
days O
. O
The O
wire O
below O
the O
handle O
started O
to O
heat O
up O
a O
little O
bit O
, O
I O
smelled O
smoke O
. O
At O
first O
thought O
it O
was O
my O
hair O
. O
But O
, O
the O
thing O
died O
shortly O
after O
. O
I O
have O
another O
blow O
dryer O
. O
Not O
sure O
if O
I O
received O
a O
lemon O
or O
if O
this O
is O
Andis O
quality O
. O
My O
past O
blowdryers O
from O
other O
reputable O
firms O
would O
last O
7 O
- O
10 O
years O
. O
4 O
months O
was O
a O
HUGE O
let O

  O
Definite O
space O
saver O
. O
Quiet O
. O
Does O
the O
job O
. O
I O
feel O
the O
low O
setting O
is O
definitely O
very O
low O
, O
much O
lower O
than O
my O
travel O
blow O
dryer O
you O
can O
find O
at O
any O
drugstore O
. O
However O
, O
I O
like O
the O
higher O
setting O
. O
It O
's O
nice O
to O
wash O
, O
blowdry O
and O
head O
out O
. O
Makes O
my O
mornings O
much O
easier O
to O
have O
things O
in O
place O
and O
organized O
. O
This O
blow O
dryer O
comes O
with O
two O
long O
screws O
. O
You O
have O
to O
remove O
the O
baby O
screws O
on O
the O
plate O
on O
the O
back O
. O
I O
then O
marked O
the O
walls O
where O
the O
two O
holes O
are O
. O
The O
plastic O
anchors O
I O
did O
not O
use O
, O
because O
the O
frame O
/ O
holder O
is O
super O
light O
weight O
. O
So O
is O
the O
dryer O
. O
It O
's O
nice O
. O
In O
addition O
, O
the O
green O
light O
makes O
a O
nice O
nightlight O
in O
the O
bathroom O
. O
Personally O
, O
I O
wish O
I O
could O
change O
the O
color O
to O
clear O
or O
blue O
. O
The O
photo O
they O
provide O
shows O
the O
cord O
hook O
is O
on O
the O
right O
side O
. O
There O
are O
two O
other O
sm O
/ O
med O
size O
screws O
to O
hang O
the O
cord O
to O
either O
the O
left O
or O
right O
side O
. O
I O
prefer O
the O
right O
side O
; O
however O
it O
all O
depends O
on O
where O
you O
place O
it O
in O
your O
bathroom O
. O
It O
's O
a O
great O
product O
. O
They O
thought O
of O
almost O
everything O
on O
this O
dryer O
. O
The O
only O
two O
things O
I O
would O
change O
is O
to O
have O
even O
a O
more O
minimized O
holder O
( O
semi O
- O
translucent O
) O
, O
optional O
colored O
dryers O
, O
retractable O
cord O
, O
small O
dryer O
, O
more O
powerful O
, O
cool O
air O
option O
dryer O
( O
i.e. O
fan O
with O
a O
hold O
button O
;-) O
, O
no O
cord O
but O
a O
chargeable O
blow O
dryer O
. O
I O
think O
that O
's O
about O
it O
. O

I O
read O
some O
bad O
reviews O
on O
this O
hair O
dryer O
but O
so O
far O
I O
have O
not O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
it O
. O
I O
actually O
love O
it O
, O
cute O
colors O
and O
drys O
well O

I O
hardly O
ever O
write O
reviews O
, O
but O
this O
thing O
is O
fantastic O
. O
I O
was O
amazed O
when O
I O
blow O
dryer O
my O
hair O
and O
it O
was O
actually O
softer O
. O
The O
price O
may O
seem O
steep O
, O
but O
it O
's O
definitely O
worth O
it O
. O
LOVE O
! O

Great O

1st O
of O
all O
I O
love O
the O
decent O
packaging O
. O
It O
comes O
in O
a O
box O
. O
My O
previous O
dryer O
was O
packed O
in O
a O
combination O
of O
cardboard O
and O
plastic O
which O
you O
open O
once O
and O
that O
s O
it O
. O
You O
have O
to O
throw O
the O
packaging O
and O
there O
is O
no O
placd O
to O
put O
the O
dryer O
back O
. O
But O
this O
dryer O
comes O
in O
a O
box O
and O
you O
can O
put O
back O
in O
the O
box O
. O
The O
dryer O
comes O
with O
a O
control O
nozzle O
which O
helps O
you O
to O
focus O
on O
certain O
areas O
. O
I O
have O
very O
thick O
hair O
and O
I O
used O
to O
hate O
taking O
shower O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
drying O
afterwards O
. O
Because O
it O
used O
to O
take O
ne O
really O
long O
time O
to O
dry O
them O
. O
Now O
with O
Rimini O
dryer O
it O
takes O
me O
10 O
mins O
and O
I O
m O
ready O
to O
go O
out O
. O
Especially O
in O
winter O
I O
get O
sick O
when O
I O
go O
out O
with O
wet O
hair O
. O
Rimini O
dryer O
has O
saved O
my O
life O
, O
time O
, O
and O
energy O
. O
This O
dryer O
is O
great O
for O
heavy O
, O
thick O
, O
long O
and O
even O
short O
and O
thin O
hair O
. O
Ut O
works O
great O
and O
helps O
you O
style O
your O
hair O
. O
Like O
my O
older O
conair O
dryer O
it O
has O
cold O
air O
button O
too O
. O
It O
has O
different O
levels O
of O
air O
pressure O
. O
The O
handle O
is O
great O
to O
grip O
on O
. O
My O
older O
dryer O
's O
handle O
got O
so O
greasy O
after O
few O
use O
. O
This O
dryer O
is O
awesome O
. O
Im O
100 O
% O
satisfied O
with O
this O
dryer O
. O
I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O
This O
is O
the O
best O
hair O
dryer O
I O
have O
ever O
owned O
. O
I O
received O
the O
Rimini O
dryer O
in O
exchange O
of O
my O
honest O
opinion O
but O
it O
did O
nt O
affect O
my O
thought O
. O

It O
works O
as O
expected O
. O

This O
hairdryer O
works O
fine O
, O
is O
light O
to O
handle O
and O
not O
too O
loud O
. O
  O
It O
does O
, O
however O
, O
have O
a O
burst O
- O
of O
- O
cold O
- O
air O
button O
which O
is O
difficult O
to O
use O
. O
  O
It O
's O
positioned O
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
you O
feel O
it O
should O
be O
pushed O
UP O
instead O
of O
IN O
. O
This O
button O
is O
rectangular O
and O
flat O
, O
again O
making O
it O
look O
and O
feel O
like O
it O
should O
be O
pushed O
up O
and O
not O
in O
. O
  O
Trying O
to O
push O
this O
button O
IN O
is O
often O
somewhat O
difficult O
( O
too O
thin O
; O
too O
highly O
set O
) O
and O
takes O
several O
tries O
. O
  O
If O
it O
were O
n't O
for O
that O
button O
, O
which O
I O
seem O
to O
use O
a O
lot O
, O
I O
'd O
have O
given O
it O
5 O
stars O
instead O
of O
4 O
. O
  O
Other O
than O
that O
, O
I O
do O
like O
this O
hairdryer O
. O

So O
far O
, O
so O
good O
. O
  O
I O
have O
found O
that O
these O
hair O
dryers O
do O
not O
last O
, O
so O
, O
time O
will O
tell O
. O
Works O
good O
, O
no O
complaints O
. O

Works O
great O

Works O
great O
, O
but O
is O
a O
bit O
louder O
than O
I O
expected O
. O

lasted O
all O
of O
10 O
minutes O
before O
failing O
. O

Low O
power O
, O
but O
with O
patience O
it O
does O
a O
beautiful O
job O

Good O
just O
loudd O

Do O
n't O
know O
the O
longevity O
of O
this O
item O
yet O
. O
But O
it O
's O
a O
must O
have O
for O
travel O
. O
On O
the O
Euro O
setting O
, O
low O
is O
high O
enough O
! O
I O
have O
lots O
of O
fine O
, O
curly O
medium O
length O
hair O
and O
it O
dried O
in O
less O
than O
10 O
minutes O
. O
Yes O
, O
it O
's O
loud O
but O
worth O
it O
as O
a O
space O
saver O
and O
effective O
dryer O
! O

Bought O

year O
now O
! O

My O
girlfriend O
loved O
this O
dryer O
... O
except O
for O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
motor O
died O
after O
a O
year O
... O
super O
annoyed O

Lasted O
less O
than O
8 O
months O

thought O
it O
was O
smaller O
! O
! O

Black O
and O
pink O
. O
I O
could O
n't O
tell O
from O
the O
pictures O
it O
was O
black O
and O
pink O
so O
I O
gave O
it O
to O
my O
wife O
. O
She O
is O
happy O
with O
it O
. O

Wonderful O

  O
Purchased O
due O

shoulder O
injury O
and O

post O

  O
I O
can O
blow O
dry O
hair O
while O

securely O
holds O
blow O
dryer O
and O
can O
safely O
move O
it O
in O
any O
direction O
. O

I O
love O
the O
sleek O
design O
, O
and O
color O
of O
this O
hair O

but O
I O
had O
one O

loved O
more O
. O
So O
, O
I O
gave O
this O
one O
to O
my O
mom O
. O
The O
ionic O
technology O
really O
plays O
a O
role O
in O
hair O
dryers O
, O
helping O
maintain O
, O
a O
healthy O
, O
beautiful O

Or O

your O
hair O
with O
cool O
hair O

Perfect O
for O

  O
This O

but O
its O
still O
a O
hair O
dryer O
, O
so O
its O
going O
to O
be O
noisy O
. O
  O
I O
really O

Who O

the O

well O
. O

Bought O
this O

a O
present O
for O
my O

expensive O
high O
end O

that O
it O
replaced O
and O
weighs O
less O
. O

I O
got O
this O
to O
replace O
an O
ancient O
hairdryer O
that O
just O
was O
n't O
working O
well O
anymore O
. O
  O
This O
is O
a O
wonderful O
hairdryer O
! O
  O
I O
can O
dry O
my O
hair O
quickly O
and O
it O
has O
all O
the O
possible O
settings O

I O
'll O
ever O
need O
. O
  O
I O

this O
! O

Okay O

Great O
Product O
! O
  O
I O
broke O
down O
and O
got O
this O
dryer O
to O
take O
with O
me O
while O
traveling O
. O
  O
I O
loved O
my O
other O
Conair O
hair O
dryer O
so O
decided O
to O
find O
something O
that O
could O
pack O
in O
a O
suitcase O
. O
  O
This O
hair O
dryer O
puts O
out O
a O
ton O
of O
heat O
for O
such O
a O
small O
product O
! O
  O
I O
love O
it O
. O
  O
It O
is O
perfect O
for O
the O
traveler O
as O
well O
as O
someone O
who O
appreciates O
a O
great O
product O
! O

I O
have O
very O
thick O
, O
very O
curly O
hair O
that O
typically O
takes O
a O
LONG O
time O
to O
dry O
. O
The O
little O
mini O
- O
hair O
- O
driers O
that O
you O
find O
in O
most O
hotels O
these O
days O
just O
wo O
n't O
do O
the O
job O
for O
me O
and O
none O
of O
them O
have O
a O
diffuser O
or O
will O
fit O
a O
travel O
- O
diffuser O
attachment O
( O
which O
us O
curly O
- O
girls O
require O
) O
. O
But O
with O
this O
hair O
- O
drier O
, O
I O
found O
the O
answer O
! O
! O
! O
It O
has O
GREAT O
air O
- O
power O
, O
2 O
heat O
settings O
, O
and O
dual O
voltage O
so O
you O
can O
take O
it O
on O
overseas O
trips O
as O
well O
. O
Barely O
adds O
any O
weight O
to O
your O
luggage O
( O
so O
important O
these O
days O
now O
that O
airlines O
charge O
a O
hefty O
fee O
for O
non O
- O
carry O
- O
on O
luggage O
or O
baggage O
that O
exceeds O
their O
weight O
limit O
) O
and O
the O
handle O
folds O
up O
for O
compact O
packing O
. O
The O
diffuser O
attachment O
works O
quite O
well O
-- O
maybe O
not O
quite O
as O
effective O
as O
my O
full O
- O
size O
diffuser O
with O
my O
full O
- O
size O
drier O
, O
but O
pretty O
darned O
good O
. O
It O
's O
great O
for O
travel O
and O
will O
have O
your O
tresses O
looking O
gorgeous O
in O
no O
time O
. O
Highly O
recommended O
! O

  O
Very O
Powerful O

compact O

Lasts O

Does O
not O
produce O
static O
. O
I O
'm O
on O
my O
3rd O
one O
, O
not O
because O
the O
previous O
two O
were O
faulty O
, O
but O
because O
I O
lost O
one O
and O
the O
other O
finally O
wore O
out O
. O
I O
only O
wish O
they O
made O
them O
in O
more O
colors O
. O
Buy O
this O
and O
you O
wo O
n't O
regret O

. O

Absolutely O
love O
this O
hairdryer O
! O
  O
It O
is O
compact O
and O
convenient O
but O
does O
not O
sacrifice O
any O
power O
. O
  O
I O
have O
really O
thick O
, O
wavy O
hair O
and O
this O
travel O
dryer O
is O
the O
best O
I O
have O
found O
. O
  O
I O
now O
have O
multiple O
! O

Love O
the O
dryer O
because O
it O
is O
small O
-- O
wish O
the O
price O
were O
not O
quite O
so O
high O
. O

a O

Not O
sure O
what O
features O
might O
be O
missing O
to O
make O
this O
hair O
dryer O
sell O
at O
such O
a O
low O
price O
. O
It O
does O
everything O
I O
need O
it O
to O
, O
plus O
has O
two O
attachments O
I O
've O
never O
used O
( O
pinpointer O
and O
curler O
? O
) O
The O
' O
cool O
' O
button O
actually O
gets O
cool O
pretty O
quick O
and O
feels O
a O
little O
cooler O
than O
the O
ambient O
temp O
. O
Does O
n't O
have O
a O
' O
medium O
' O
setting O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
's O
worth O
20 O
bucks O
. O
If O
you O
do O
n't O
like O
the O
color O
blue O
, O
well O
you O
're O
outta O
luck O
. O
Guess O
since O
it O
is O
n't O
foldable O
, O
it O
may O
not O
be O
good O
for O
travel O
. O
Whatever O
, O
it O
blow O
dries O
my O
hair O
at O
home O
when O
I O
need O
it O
to O
and O
does O
a O
good O
job O
at O
that O
. O
Will O
update O
review O
if O
it O
spontaneously O
melts O
or O
explodes O
. O
    O
BTW O
, O
review O
is O
based O
on O
the O
price O
I O
paid O
for O
it O
. O
The O
price O
seems O
to O
fluctuate O
a O
lot O
so O
wait O
until O
a O
seller O
offers O
it O
for O
10 O
dollars O
or O
less O
. O
Otherwise O
, O
it O
's O
pretty O
much O
the O
same O
deal O
as O
any O
other O
blow O
dryer O
. O

My O
wife O

2 O

years O

  O
This O
one O
lasted O
just O
about O
15 O
months O

  O
Nice O
product O

poor O
ROI O

Thought O
I O
was O
the O
only O
weirdo O
that O
struggled O
to O
dry O
her O
hair O
w O
/ O
in O
45mins O
. O
Recently O
found O
out O
my O
best O
friend O
is O
the O
same O
& O
she O
( O
like O
me O
) O
was O
convinced O
there O
was O
no O
way O
around O
it O

Writing O
this O

c O
there O
's O
probably O
more O
of O
us O
out O
there O

  O
And O
you O
100 O
% O
are O
n't O
stuck O
. O
I've O
got O
long O
, O
thin O
hair O
- O
but O
a O
lot O
of O
it O
. O
  O
It O
traps O
moisture O
& O
it O
's O
naturally O
wavy O
, O
so O
it O
always O
took O
me O
30 O
- O
45mins O
to O
tame O
it O
dry O
. O
  O
Most O
of O
the O
time O
, O
a O
solid O
45mins O

  O
Result O
was O
hit O

Since O
I O
have O

  O
And O
it O

particularly O
the O

to O
give O

  O
It O

friends O
have O
commented O
that O
I O
look O
normal O

do O
n't O
. O
  O
PS O
- O
The O
brush O
& O
Shu O
is O
n't O
a O
hack O
- O
the O
dryer O
is O
. O
  O
The O
3 O
together O
is O
trifecta O
. O
I O
was O
ecstatic O
to O
find O
this O
- O
I O
'd O
always O
struggled O
just O
to O
tame O
my O
stubborn O
hair O
. O
  O
Now O
I O
actually O
feel O
in O
control O
of O
it O
. O
  O
Just O
bought O
a O
replacement O
for O
my O
3/4yr O
old O
original O
& O
also O
bought O
one O
for O
my O
mom O
as O
an O
xmas O
present O
. O
My O
friend O
's O
now O
a O
convert O
& O
begging O
for O
the O
name O
of O
my O
dryer O
. O
You O
wo O
n't O
regret O
. O

Do O
n't O
need O
a O
towel O
anymore O
in O
college O
. O

Time O
has O
proven O
this O
is O
a O
good O
product O
. O
  O
Would O
buy O
another O
one O
. O

I O
liked O
this O
hair O
dryer O
well O
enough O
until O
sparks O
started O
shooting O
out O
where O
the O
cord O
is O
attached O
! O
I O
only O
use O
this O
dryer O
3x O
a O
week O
and O
it O
did O
n't O
even O
last O
8 O
MONTHS O
! O
That O
's O
ridiculous O
. O
I O
loved O
the O
length O
of O
the O
cord O
and O
that O
it O
had O
attachments O
. O
I O
smelled O
burning O
and O
sparks O
started O
shooting O
from O
my O
dryer O
, O
I O
throw O
it O
on O
the O
floor O
and O
quickly O
unplugged O
it O
. O
When O
I O
picked O
it O
up O
, O
the O
entire O
unit O
was O
very O
hot O
to O
the O
touch O
and O
the O
cord O
had O
completely O
severed O
one O
of O
the O
wires O
. O
That O
was O
not O
like O
that O
before O
I O
started O
. O
Is O
it O
too O
much O
to O
ask O
for O
a O
safe O
hair O
dryer O
? O

BEST O

We O
had O
the O
same O
one O
that O
lasted O
for O
7 O
years O
. O
It O
is O
pretty O
noisy O
. O
I O
thought O
maybe O
they O
had O
made O
them O
to O
be O
less O
noisy O
now O
. O

It O
dosent O
have O
hot O

! O

Great O
hairdryer O
. O
  O
First O
used O
it O
at O
a O
hotel O
and O
was O
finally O
able O
to O
locate O
one O
online O
. O

K O

Smell O
burning O
from O
the O
dryer O

Quite O
noisy O
compared O
to O
others O
we O
have O
had O
. O
Retraction O
cord O
has O
to O
be O
jiggled O
in O
order O
to O
retract O
. O

Works O
great O
to O
dry O
my O
daughters O
natural O
hair O
. O

Works O
well O
and O
the O
speed O
and O
temperature O
  O
adjustments O
are O
easy O
to O
use O
. O
  O
Well O
worth O
the O
small O
amount O
it O
costs O
. O

It O
works O
. O
Has O
only O
two O
controls O
, O
with O
the O
off O
switch O
located O
between O
them O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
find O
this O
very O
appealing O
, O
but O
I O
do O
find O
it O
does O
n't O
take O
very O
long O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
with O
this O
machine O
. O
My O
hair O
is O
thick O
, O
straight O
, O
and O
shoulder O
- O
length O
. O

I O
love O
this O
product O
, O
it O
has O
a O
good O
performance O
, O
I O
really O
fall O
in O
love O
, O
is O
simple O
to O
use O
and O
practice O
to O
mobilize O

I O
have O
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
try O
quite O
a O
few O
Xtava O
products O
and O
I O
am O
overwhelmed O
by O
the O
quality O
of O
their O
items O
. O
  O
I O
'd O
never O
heard O
of O
Xtava O
prior O
to O
November O
and O
for O
being O
a O
virtual O
unknown O
in O
the O
heavily O
competitive O
beauty O
market O
, O
they O
really O
are O
creating O
products O
that O
will O
last O
. O
  O
I O
hope O
that O
they O
are O
able O
to O
get O
a O
foothold O
in O
this O
industry O
and O
keep O
on O
making O
such O
great O
items!The O
Rimini O
blow O
dryer O
for O
starters O
, O
is O
a O
gorgeous O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
We O
desperately O
needed O
a O
new O
hair O
dryer O
because O
ours O
is O
ready O
to O
die O
anytime O
now O
. O
  O
This O
definitely O
is O
a O
step O
up O
from O
the O
cheapo O
dryer O
we O
had O
purchased O
. O
It O
drys O
our O
hair O
so O
quickly O
. O
  O
Even O
my O
daughter O
who O
has O
much O
thicker O
and O
coarse O
hair O
than O
myself O
it O
does O
n't O
take O
much O
time O
at O
all O
until O
her O
hair O
is O
completely O
dry O
. O
  O
There O
are O
two O
speed O
settings O
, O
low O
and O
high O
as O
well O
as O
three O
heat O
settings O
plus O
the O
Cold O
Shot O
button O
. O
  O
I O
find O
that O
I O
use O
the O
medium O
heat O
and O
the O
high O
speed O
settings O
the O
most O
. O
I O
also O
love O
that O
it O
has O
a O
little O
hook O
on O
it O
so O
that O
you O
can O
easily O
hang O
it O
on O
a O
nail O
for O
easy O
access O
in O
your O
bathroom O
. O
  O
The O
cord O
is O
long O
enough O
to O
be O
able O
to O
style O
your O
hair O
just O
about O
anywhere O
you O
need O
it O
. O
  O
It O
's O
not O
like O
REAL O
quiet O
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O
as O
loud O
as O
some O
hairdryers O
. O
  O
It O
really O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
dryer O
's O
I O
've O
used O
and O
it O
's O
definitely O
the O
best O

I O

much O
that O
I O
purchased O
another O
one O
when O
my O
first O
shorted O
out O
. O
  O
This O
morning O
my O
second O
one O
was O
completely O
dead O
. O
  O
And O
I O
had O
a O
soaking O
wet O
head O
and O
20 O
minutes O
to O
get O
ready O
for O
work O
. O
  O
It O
does O
n't O
get O
much O
worse O
. O
  O
I O
'm O
not O
rough O
with O
it O
and O
each O
lasted O
less O
than O
a O
year O
. O
This O
thing O
is O
simply O
not O
reliable O
. O
  O
I O
should O
n't O
have O
tried O
it O
twice O
. O
Do O
not O
recommend O
. O

Works O
great O
, O
cord O
retracts O
as O
expected O
. O

I O
've O
been O
using O
this O
for O
the O
past O
3 O
, O
almost O
4 O
years O
and O
it O
still O
works O
the O
same O
way O
as O
when O
I O
first O
took O
it O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

My O
wife O
loves O
it O
; O

Perfect O
size O
, O
dries O
my O
hair O
fast O
. O
  O
I O
like O
the O
built O
- O
in O
nightlight O
. O

I O
love O
it O
very O
much O
. O
I O
recommend O
for O
anyone O
who O
is O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
Roseli O

I O
love O
my O
wall O
mounted O
blow O
dryer O
! O
It O
puts O
out O
a O
great O
volume O
of O
air O
which O
I O
like O
and O
was O
looking O
for O
. O
It O
does O
n't O
get O
too O
hot O
.... O
temp O
is O
just O
right O
. O
I O
like O
the O
small O
amber O
night O
light O
in O
the O
bathroom O
at O
night O
. O
I O
would O
purchase O
this O
item O
again O
in O
a O
heart O
beat O
! O

I O
gave O
this O
to O
my O
daughter O
for O
Christmas O
. O
  O
She O
said O
that O
she O
loves O
it O
! O

Very O
nice O
dryer O
. O
  O
It O
's O
not O
as O
powerful O
as O
ones O
I O
've O
had O
in O
the O
past O
but O
I O
have O
short O
hair O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
would O
be O
powerful O
enough O
for O
long O
hair O
. O
It O
was O
my O
mistake O
not O
to O
realize O
the O
power O
level O
that O
was O
posted O
in O
the O
ad O
. O

My O
mother O
loves O
this O
lightweight O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
Says O
its O
easy O
to O
use O
. O

I O
really O
love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
I O
like O
that O
it O
has O
black O
with O
a O
touch O
of O
pink O
on O
it O
. O
It O
's O
made O
with O
sturdy O
material O
and O
it O
is O
n't O
to O
heavy O
to O
handle O
when O
drying O
your O
hair O
. O
I O
only O
use O
the O
cold O
air O
since O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
damage O
my O
hair O
. O
It O
's O
nice O
that O
you O
can O
choose O
between O
cold O
air O
and O
warm O
air O
and O
each O
has O
a O
high O
and O
low O
setting O
. O
It O
also O
has O
two O
attachments O
which O
is O
perfect O
, O
depending O
on O
your O
preference O
. O
This O
a O
great O
product O
to O
use O
for O
your O
daily O
hair O
routine O
and O
it O
's O
even O
a O
good O
size O
for O
travel O
. O
It O
's O
a O
perfect O
gift O
to O
give O
any O
women O
in O
your O
life O
. O
I O
'm O
very O
happy O
with O
all O
the O
XTAVA O
products O
I O
've O
gotten O
to O
review O
. O
They O
're O
all O
high O
- O
quality O
products O
and O
I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
their O
products O
! O

I O
love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O

Installed O
this O
unit O
in O
my O
RV O
. O
  O
Works O
great O
for O
it O
's O
size O
. O
Gets O
very O
hot O
on O
HI O
. O

It O
still O
works O
like O
the O
first O
day O
i O
had O
it O
, O
but O
the O
retractable O
cord O
takes O
a O
little O
finagling O
to O
get O
it O
all O
the O
way O
back O
in O
. O
  O
Nonetheless O
, O
it O
's O
much O
better O
than O
having O
all O
these O
cords O
all O
over O
the O
place O
! O

Decent O
product O
, O
although O
, O
the O
air O
volume O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
be O
as O
good O
as O
other O
similar O
products O
like O
this O
that O
I O
have O
bought O
. O
  O
I O
do O
like O
that O
there O
is O
a O
place O
to O
hang O
the O
cord O
to O
get O
it O
off O
the O
counter O
. O
  O
It O
does O
do O
the O
job O
, O
so O
I O
am O
fairly O
pleased O
with O
it O
. O

Love O
it O
! O

When O
it O
was O
fairly O
new O
the O
hair O
dryer O
switch O
refused O
to O
go O
the O
the O
high O
position O
. O
  O
Unfortunately O
, O
since O
I O
purchased O
it O
as O
a O
Christmas O
gift O
for O
a O
family O
member O
long O
before O
Christmas O
, O
I O
was O
not O
able O
to O
return O
it O
to O
Amazon O
so O
I O
had O
to O
pay O
almost O
the O
cost O
of O
the O
hair O
dryer O
in O
shipping O
fees O
to O
return O
it O
to O
the O
manufacturer O
. O
  O
I O
just O
received O
the O
warranty O
replacement O
unit O
. O
  O
The O
hair O
dryer O
performs O
great O
, O
but O
the O
switch O
failure O
was O
annoying O
. O

This O
is O
the O
third O
house O
we O
have O
put O
these O
into O
our O
master O
baths O
. O
  O
I O
even O
have O
one O
installed O
in O
our O
RV O
! O
  O
So O
handy O
and O
so O
much O
neater O
in O
appearance O
. O

Flimsy O
, O
does O
not O
dry O
well O
, O
not O
adjustable O
, O
will O
easily O
collapse O
on O
your O
head O
. O

The O
hair O
dryer O
seems O
to O
be O
of O
good O
quality O
so O
far O
, O
but O
the O
color O
is O
deceiving O
by O
the O
picture O
. O
  O
I O
bought O
it O
specifically O
because O
it O
looked O
purple O
since O
that O
is O
my O
granddaughter O
's O
favorite O
color O
, O
but O
when O
it O
arrived O
, O
it O
was O
very O
pink O
, O
which O
was O
disappointing O
. O
  O
It O
should O
have O
had O
a O
better O
description O
in O
the O
specs O
. O

Perfect O
size O
. O
Does O
just O
what O
I O
want O
! O
! O
! O
No O
complaints O
! O

The O
exterior O
of O
this O
hair O
dryer O
melted O
and O
I O
can O
no O
longer O
use O
any O
of O
the O
attachments O
. O
Poor O
quality O
for O
the O
price O
. O

Dried O
my O
wife O
's O
thick O
hair O
in O
10 O
minutes O
. O

Works O
great O
and O
half O
the O
cost O
of O
the O
store O
. O
Plus O
free O
Shipping O
. O

best O
ever O
! O
has O
lasted O
a O
long O
time O
! O

I O
Love O
my O
Conair O
Turbo O
Hair O
Dryer O
. O
It O
works O
great O
and O
makes O
my O
hair O
look O
and O
feel O
better O
. O
I O
recommend O
this O
product O
to O
my O
friends O
and O
family O
. O

the O
multitude O
of O
setting O
combinations O
allow O
me O
to O
control O
how O
my O
hair O
dries- O
its O
naturally O
very O
wavy O
and O
gets O
frizzy O
fast O
, O
but O
i O
have O
n't O
had O
any O
issues O
like O
that O
with O
this O
dryer O
yet O
. O

Connectors O
always O
comes O
off O
. O
Overheats O
. O
Put O
on O
medium O
setting O
and O
it O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
. O
Not O
100 O
% O
what O
I O
wanted O
but O
it O
works O
. O

This O
is O
actually O
a O
really O
great O
hair O
dryer O
! O
I O
love O
how O
compact O
it O
is O
( O
smaller O
than O
regular O
sized O
dryers O
) O
, O
it O
is O
almost O
like O
a O
travel O
type O
of O
dryer O
. O
I O
find O
it O
very O
easy O
to O
use O
and O
that O
it O
gives O
me O
such O
the O
softest O
appearance O
with O
hair O
. O
I O
'm O
a O
College O
Student O
so O
I O
'm O
always O
on O
the O
go O
whether O
its O
going O
from O
class O
to O
class O
to O
traveling O
to O
yoga O
class O
/ O
gym O
I O
definitely O
need O
something O
as O
flexible O
as O
I O
am O
. O
My O
hair O
is O
on O
the O
normal O
side O
, O
not O
too O
thick O
and O
not O
too O
thin O
. O
It O
is O
also O
fairly O
straight O
. O
I O
feel O
that O
this O
hair O
dryer O
without O
the O
diffuser O
( O
black O
top O
) O
creates O
such O
a O
satin O
feel O
to O
the O
hair O
and O
that O
with O
the O
diffuser O
on O
my O
hair O
gets O
so O
shiny O
! O
So O
what O
I O
do O
is O
do O
about O
2 O
- O
5 O
min O
without O
the O
black O
top O
diffuser O
and O
3 O
minutes O
with O
it O
on O
. O
The O
cool O
thing O
about O
this O
hair O
dryer O
is O
that O
it O
comes O
with O
2 O
diffusers O
( O
one O
wide O
and O
one O
thin O
) O
, O
it O
helps O
cater O
to O
your O
hair O
and O
what O
you O
want O
done O
to O
it O
. O
Overall O
this O
is O
an O
excellent O
hair O
dryer O
, O
everything O
form O
the O
Xtava O
line O
so O
far O
has O
been O
fantastic O
. O
I O
have O
received O
this O
product O
complimentary O
for O
my O
review O
but O
definitely O
believe O
that O
this O
product O
is O
great O
and O
affordable O
! O

Works O
great O
! O
  O
My O
12 O
year O
old O
and O
9 O
year O
old O
daughters O
use O
it O
and O
it O
's O
easier O
for O
them O
than O
using O
a O
regular O
hair O
dryer O
. O

TINY O
! O
Not O
the O
same O
size O
as O
the O
usual O
ones O
this O
style O
so O
keep O
that O
in O
mind O
. O
Other O
than O
that O
, O
it O
still O
works O
well O
. O
It O
is O
a O
bit O
louder O
than O
more O
pricey O
hair O
dryers O
. O
Has O
a O
distinct O
rattle O
sound O
. O
I O
bought O
this O
for O
my O
mother O
who O
does O
n't O
have O
that O
much O
hair O
. O
I O
have O
a O
thick O
mane O
of O
it O
and O
it O
works O
but O
takes O
too O
long O
. O
Not O
the O
best O
for O
styling O
. O

Good O
product O
for O
the O
price O

I O
like O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
I O
bought O
it O
based O
on O
reviews O
. O
  O
It O
is O
slightly O
heavier O
than O
my O
old O
one O
, O
but O
it O
's O
well O
balanced O
and O
is O
smaller O
, O
which O
I O
like O
. O
  O
As O
far O
as O
the O
placement O
of O
the O
buttons O
, O
I O
find O
that O
my O
thumb O
goes O
right O
between O
both O
buttons O
so O
when O
it O
's O
on O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
move O
either O
button O
during O
use O
. O
  O
Quite O
happy O
with O
this O
purchase O
. O

Just O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
.... O
works O
great O
! O

Love O
it O
I O
use O
it O
on O
all O
my O
clients O
and O
gets O
very O
hot O

Very O
good O
and O
efficient O
quiet O
too O
. O

had O
it O
about O
5 O
months O
. O
  O
very O
happy O
with O
it O
. O
  O
light O
enought O
for O
3/4th O
graders O
to O
use O
on O
longer O
hair O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
if O
I O
had O
low O
expectations O
going O
in O
or O
what O
but O
very O
pleasantly O
surprised O
with O
the O
results O
. O
Not O
too O
loud O
, O
fits O
my O
head O
properly O
and O
will O
dry O
your O
hair O
( O
obviously O
you O
're O
probably O
going O
to O
sit O
under O
there O
for O
awhile O
.. O
Took O
me O
about O
2hr30mins O
) O
. O
Money O
well O
spent O
( O
especially O
considering O
the O
$ O
$ O
$ O
spent O
at O
the O
salon O
) O
. O

This O
hairdryer O
is O
great O
. O
It O
is O
so O
much O
better O
than O
the O
cheap O
25 O
dollars O
hair O
dryers O
I O
used O
to O
get O
from O
the O
store O
. O
No O
frizz O
( O
and O
I O
live O
in O
Florida O
where O
we O
have O
tons O
of O
humidity O
) O
and O
it O
dries O
my O
hair O
in O
half O
the O
time O
. O
The O
cord O
is O
not O
retractable O
, O
but O
that O
is O
my O
only O
quirk O
with O
the O
dryer O
. O
If O
you O
are O
looking O
to O
step O
up O
and O
not O
pay O
100 O
dollars O
for O
a O
hairdryer O
this O
one O
is O
awesome O
. O
I O
'm O
truly O
impressed O
. O

Nice O
size O
& O
low O
temp O
is O
quiet O
but O
high O
is O
still O
very O
loud O
. O
Got O
it O
b O
/ O
c O
comb O
attachment O
which O
stayed O
on O
for O
the O
most O
part O
except O
for O
once O
but O
I O
have O
kinky O
natural O
hair O
, O
use O
it O
to O
do O
blow O
out O
styles O

Felt O
weaker O
than O
my O
other O
1875w O
hair O
dryer O
. O
That O
said O
, O
it O
is O
affordable O
and O
compact O
. O
If O
one O
uses O
it O
for O
travel O
and O
not O
daily O
use O
, O
it O
is O
probably O
fine O
. O

Nice O
dryer O
, O
although O
heavy O
. O
Cord O
was O
no O
longer O
retractable O
after O
only O
2 O
mos O
. O
of O
use O
. O
Disappointing O
to O
say O
the O
least O
as O
that O
was O
one O
of O
the O
reasons O
I O
chose O
this O
dryer O
in O
particular O
. O
Drat O
! O

We O
love O
this O
blow O
dryer O
because O
it O
does O
the O
job O
under O
10 O
minutes O
that O
is O
a O
lifesaver O
for O
the O
people O
in O
my O
home O
. O
This O
blow O
dryer O
was O
exceptional O
value O
. O

Excelent O
! O

I O
do O
n't O
remember O
why O
I O
sent O
this O
back O
, O
but O
I O
think O
it O
was O
because O
it O
did O
not O
fold O
up O
closely O
enough O
. O
ML O

I O
honestly O
do O
not O
know O
where O
this O
has O
been O
my O
entire O
life O
. O
  O
I O
have O
very O
thick O
and O
wavy O
hair O
, O
this O
dryer O
styles O
my O
hair O
in O
half O
the O
time O
. O
  O
I O
usually O
would O
blow O
dry O
my O
hair O
, O
put O
a O
frizz O
control O
then O
use O
the O
flat O
iron O
. O
  O
With O
this O
my O
hair O
is O
healthier O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
use O
my O
flat O
iron O
as O
much O
and O
I O
use O
very O
little O
anti O
- O
frizz O
product O
now O
. O
I O
would O
reccomend O
this O
to O
anyone O
who O
has O
thick O
, O
wavy O
, O
or O
even O
curly O
hair O
and O
wants O
to O
be O
able O
to O
quickly O
style O
their O
hair O
. O
I O
've O
tried O
everything O
thing O
I O
could O
think O
of O
to O
get O
my O
hair O
to O
straighten O
easily O
and O
efficently O
and O
this O
is O
the O
one O
. O
  O
In O
32 O
years O
, O
I O
've O
never O
been O
more O
in O
love O
with O
any O
of O
my O
hair O
tools O
. O

Best O
investment O
needed O
a O
good O
blow O
dryer O

Bought O
this O
as O
a O
Christmas O
gift O
for O
my O
9 O
year O
old O
daughter O
. O
Works O
okay O
but O
does O
n't O
put O
out O
a O
lot O
of O
heat O
. O
Works O
great O
for O
her O
, O
she O
has O
short O
hair O
. O
However O
I O
have O
shoulder O
length O
hair O
and O
it O
would O
take O
to O
long O
for O
me O
to O
try O
and O
use O
. O
Great O
value O
, O
for O
younger O
girls O
it O
's O
sufficient O
. O
I O
would O
recommend O
a O
better O
blow O
dryer O
if O
you O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
hair O
or O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
to O
spend O
blowing O
drying O
your O
hair O
. O

lots O
of O
power O
... O
works O
great O

It O

great O
. O
Love O

hair O
dryer O
! O
It O
is O
so O
cute O
and O
works O
really O
well O
! O

Lots O
of O
power O
for O
a O
little O
dryer O
! O

While O
the O
flat O
iron O
is O
coming O
apart O
in O
less O
than O
a O
year O
, O
this O
hair O
dryer O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
better O
product O
so O
far O
. O

Just O
used O
my O
new O
hair O
dryer O
for O
the O
first O
time O
and O
ran O
, O
yes O
-- O
ran O
, O
to O
write O
this O
review O
. O
  O
I O
can O
not O
believe O
this O
is O
my O
hair O
! O
  O
I O
have O
shoulder O
- O
length O
, O
course O
, O
thick O
, O
curly O
hair O
which O
I O
blow O
dry O
and O
iron O
. O
  O
I O
have O
always O
used O
high O
- O
end O
hair O
dryers O
, O
but O
this O
is O
the O
best O
ever O
. O
  O
Worth O
twice O
the O
price O
! O
  O
Not O
only O
did O
my O
hair O
dry O
faster O
, O
but O
it O
dried O
frizz O
- O
free O
. O
  O
I O
did O
not O
have O
to O
flat O
iron O
it O
after O
blowing O
it O
dry O
. O
  O
First O
time O
ever O
not O
having O
to O
flat O
iron O
. O
  O
My O
hair O
looks O
like O
it O
does O
when O
I O
come O
from O
the O
hair O
dresser O
. O
  O
I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
a O
hair O
dryer O
can O
make O
this O
big O
of O
a O
difference O
, O
but O
I O
can O
assure O
you O
, O
it O
does O
. O
  O
Thank O
you O
Sedu O
. O
  O
I O
am O
a O
believer O
. O

Great O
, O
would O
highly O
recommend O
it O

Not O
hot O
enough O
or O
powerful O
enough O
to O
dry O
, O
or O
style O
, O
my O
fine O
hair O
. O

The O
low O
speed O
does O
n't O
dry O
very O
well O
. O
  O
The O
high O
speed O
is O
very O
loud O
. O
  O
It O
does O
the O
job O
but O
I O
would O
n't O
buy O
again O
. O

The O
box O
to O
the O
dryer O
was O
open O
it O
was O
missing O
the O
coupon O
that O
it O
was O
supposed O
to O
include O
. O
It O
might O
have O
been O
used O
. O
It O
was O
definitely O
opened O
... O

Good O
size O

My O
daughter O
loved O
it O
for O
Christmas O

I O
love O

what O
I O
wanted O

Came O

Amazing O
blow O

lots O
of O
power O

This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
amazing O
, O
it O
cuts O
my O
hair O
drying O
time O
to O
half O
, O
with O
smooth O
shining O
hair O
as O
result O
. O
Shipping O
was O
from O
Japan O
, O
took O
about O
10 O
days O
to O
arrive O
in O
US O
with O
registered O
mail O
. O

It O
said O
nothing O

description O

One O
of O
the O
questions O
said O
not O
ionic O
but O
the O
box O
says O
IONIC O
. O
i O
sent O
it O
back O
as O
it O
was O
not O
what O
I O
wanted O
for O
my O
fine O
hair O
.. O

Best O
hair O
dryer O
ever O
. O
  O
Need O
I O
say O
more O
? O

I O
bought O
this O
for O
my O
wife O
, O
who O
has O
long O
, O
brunette O
curly O
hair O
. O
  O
She O
blow O
dries O
her O
hair O
every O
morning O
with O
a O
diffuser O
. O
  O
I O
bought O
this O
to O
replace O
her O
current O
Conair O
dryer O
from O
Target O
which O
is O
on O
its O
way O
out O
. O
  O
Unfortunately O
, O
the O
diffuser O
with O
this O
blow O
dryer O
is O
very O
small O
( O
just O
under O
4 O
inches O
in O
diameter O
) O
. O
  O
She O
dried O
her O
hair O
once O
with O
the O
unit O
and O
said O
it O
had O
to O
go O
back O
due O
to O
the O
small O
diffuser O
and O
that O
it O
took O
too O
long O
to O
dry O
her O
hair O
. O
As O
for O
the O
positive O
, O
she O
said O
it O
was O
quieter O
than O
the O
Conair O
unit O
it O
was O
supposed O
to O
replace O
. O

I O
love O
it O
, O
it O
's O
not O
too O
heavy O
, O
not O
loud O
, O
the O
cored O
about O
4 O
ft O
, O
gives O
good O
heat O
, O
and O
leaves O
my O
hair O
soft O
and O
silky O
. O

Excellent O
product O
. O
... O
this O
a O
replacement O
for O
another O
turbo O
that O
I O
bought O
15 O
years O
ago O
, O
and O
I O
used O
almost O
every O
day O
of O
the O
week O
... O
I O
wo O
n't O
buy O
any O
other O
hair O
dryer O
. O
... O

The O
Conair O
Soft O
Bonnet O
Hair O
Dryer O
is O
exactly O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
. O
  O
I O
had O
an O
old O
one O
that O
I O
loved O
but O
I O
used O
it O
so O
much O
, O
I O
had O
to O
get O
a O
new O
one O
. O
  O
One O
thing O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
my O
old O
one O
last O
a O
very O
long O
time O
. O
  O
I O
know O
that O
I O
will O
enjoy O
my O
Soft O
Bonnet O
Hair O
Bonnet O
Dryer O
for O
years O
to O
come O
. O
  O
I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
hair O
dryer O
to O
everyone O
who O
likes O
to O
relax O
while O
getting O
their O
hair O
dry O
. O

It O
dries O
my O
hair O
very O
quickly O
and O
is O
very O
light O
weight O
. O
  O
Great O
hair O
dryer O
! O

Bought O
this O
for O
a O
monthly O
back O
- O
packing O
trip O
to O
South O
America O
. O
It O
broke O
after O
a O
week O
. O
  O
It O
should O
not O
be O
allowed O
to O
operate O
on O
High O
mode O
in O
countries O
with O
lower O
voltage O
. O

nice O
hair O
dryer O

This O
is O
my O
second O
-- O
I O
blew O
up O
the O
first O
forgetting O
to O
convert O
from O
US O
to O
European O
currency O
( O
it O
was O
quite O
dramatic O
) O
. O
  O
But O
I O
rushed O
to O
Amazon O
on O
my O
return O
and O
bought O
another O
one O
-- O
it O
really O
is O
the O
best O
US O
or O
intercontinental O
hair O
dryer O
I O
've O
ever O
traveled O
with O
. O
  O
It O
gets O
very O
hot O
on O
high O
-- O
which O
is O
just O
fine O
with O
me O
. O
  O
And O
it O
's O
a O
noisy O
sucker O
. O
But O
it O
weighs O
very O
little O
and O
is O
a O
real O
trooper O
-- O
I O
think O
I O
had O
the O
first O
one O
over O
five O
years O
( O
and O
its O
ultimate O
failure O
was O
mine O
not O
the O
manufacturer's).Read O
the O
reviews O
-- O
most O
people O
really O
really O
like O
it O
. O

Super O
great O
hair O
dryer O
for O
very O
little O
cost O
. O
  O
I O
own O
a O
$ O
200 O
hair O
dryer O
and O
like O
this O
one O
a O
lot O
better O
. O

There O
is O
nothing O
more O
to O
say O
about O
dryer O
, O
except O
that O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
. O
It O
is O
quiet O
and O
fast O
, O
like O
a O
ninja O
. O
Maybe O
they O
should O
rename O
it O
, O
lol O
. O
I O
bought O
this O
for O
my O
daughter O
, O
but O

Odd O
shaped O
barrel O
and O

  O
Not O

the O

and O
it O

n't O
very O
expensive O
. O

Works O

  O
My O

and O
frizzy O
/ O
curly O
( O
slightly O
past O
my O
shoulders O
) O
. O
  O
I O
used O
to O
have O
my O

professionally O
done O
( O
roller O
- O
set O
and O
blown O
out O

every O
week O

  O
When O
my O

I O
moved O

I O
could O
n't O
find O
a O
salon O
that O
was O
close O
enough O
for O
weekly O
appointments O
, O
and O
it O
was O
just O
getting O
expensive O
. O
  O
I O
've O
had O
other O
standing O
hair O
bonnet O
dryers O
, O
but O
this O
is O
the O
kind O
I O
see O
most O
at O
professional O
hair O
salons O
, O
and O
for O
a O
reason O
. O
  O
It O
's O
fairly O
quiet O
( O
except O
for O
the O
ticking O
sound O
from O
the O
timer O
) O
. O
  O
It O
goes O
up O
to O
75 O
degrees O
Celsius O
, O
which O
is O
about O
167 O
degrees O
Fahrenheit O
( O
very O
hot O
) O
, O
but O
there O
is O
a O
dial O
that O
lets O
you O
adjust O
the O
temperature O
all O
the O
way O
down O
to O
cool O
temps O
. O
  O
I O
usually O
keep O
mine O
at O
65 O
degrees O
Celsius O
( O
about O
150 O
F O
) O
. O
  O
There O
is O
another O
dial O
where O
you O
set O
the O
time O
and O
it O
goes O
up O
to O
a O
full O
hour O
, O
which O
is O
what O
I O
need O
. O
  O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
keeping O
track O
of O
time O
as O
the O
dryer O
turns O
off O
automatically O
with O
the O
time O
you O
set O
. O
  O
I O
just O
roller O
- O
set O
my O
hair O
, O
set O
the O
timer O
, O
and O
read O
or O
nap O
until O
the O
dryer O
stops O
. O
  O
I O
love O
it O
! O
  O
Caveat O
: O
While O
assembly O
is O
easy O
, O
it O
was O
not O
so O
smooth O
to O
do O
. O
  O
My O
husband O
had O
to O
re O
- O
order O
replacement O
parts O
because O
they O
did O
not O
fit O
together O
properly O
the O
first O
time O
. O
  O
Still O
worth O
it O
, O
if O
you O
have O
the O
space O
to O
store O
it O
! O

Easy O
mount O
. O
Heats O
well O

It O
was O
bigger O
than O
I O
expected O
and O
heavier O
than O
expected O
but O
it O
works O
better O
than O
the O
diffuser O
that O
came O
with O
my O
other O
dryer O
. O

Works O
great O
! O
  O
I O
love O
that O
it O
's O
big O
since O
I O
have O
tons O
of O
hair O
. O

It O
's O
a O
little O
bigger O
than O
I O
had O
imagined O
but O
the O
weight O
is O
okay O
and O
it O
works O
quick O
. O
I O
have O
n't O
noticed O
any O
change O
in O
my O
hair O
texture O
or O
look O
but O
it O
works O
well O
otherwise O
. O
And O
mine O
did O
n't O
come O
with O
a O
diffuser O
as O
some O
reviews O
mention O
. O

Works O
as O
expected O
, O
but O
the O
Scotch O
sticky O
mounts O
do O
n't O
hold O
up O
against O
steam O
... O

I O
love O
it O
! O
! O
! O

I O
like O
this O
hair O
dryer O
, O
but O
it O
's O
just O
not O
well O
suited O
for O
a O
man O
's O
use O
- O
especially O
in O
the O
gym O
. O
  O
I O
had O
purchased O
it O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
during O
the O
winter O
months O
. O
  O
It O
is O
not O
overly O
loud O
and O
provides O
a O
high O
volume O
of O
air O
- O
too O
much O
to O
manage O
the O
shorter O
hair O
most O
men O
wear O
. O
  O
It O
's O
also O
much O
heavier O
than O
I O
expected O
it O
to O
be O
. O
  O
I O
decided O
to O
go O
with O
a O
model O
with O
a O
comb O
and O
brush O
attachment O
. O
A O
word O
of O
caution O
concerning O
the O
folding O
handle O
on O
this O
unit O
. O
  O
The O
first O
time O
I O
used O
it O
I O
had O
my O
forefinger O
too O
close O
to O
the O
top O
of O
the O
handle O
and O
it O
pinched O
the O
heck O
out O
of O
me O
. O
  O
I O
still O
have O
a O
sore O
spot O
on O
my O
finger O
a O
week O
later O
. O
  O
Be O
careful O
when O
opening O
. O

I O
know O
some O
other O
reviewers O
have O
raved O
about O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
For O
me O
, O
it O
's O
just O
okay O
. O
It O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
. O
I O
've O
got O
fine O
, O
thin O
hair O
, O
so O
most O
dryers O
will O
do O
that O
. O
And O
it O
does O
keep O
the O
static O
down O
a O
bit O
. O
I O
find O
it O
heavier O
and O
more O
awkward O
than O
my O
previous O
Sassoon O
dryer O
that O
used O
to O
have O
an O
ionizer O
function O
but O
does O
not O
now O
. O
The O
switches O
on O
this O
dryer O
are O
more O
difficult O
to O
work O
. O
They O
're O
sliders O
that O
are O
only O
slightly O
elevated O
from O
the O
underlying O
plastic O
layer O
and O
have O
a O
narrow O
slightly O
elevated O
lip O
at O
on O
end O
that O
I O
suppose O
is O
designed O
to O
make O
them O
easier O
to O
move O
but O
does O
n't O
do O
much O
for O
me O
. O
It O
works O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
keeping O
it O
. O
But O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
I O
'd O
buy O
it O
again O
. O

I O
like O
how O
small O
it O
is O
and O
has O
good O
power O
makes O
it O
easy O
to O
travel O
with O
does O
n't O
take O
up O
much O
room O

Product O
arrived O
quickly O
and O
worked O
as O
expected O
in O
Europe O
. O

Like O
it O
. O

I O
good O
investment O
. O

It O
's O
really O
good O
and O
light O
weight O
to O
carry O
aroundBut O
the O
only O
drawback O
I O
feel O
is O
the O
souf O
which O
makes O
my O
lil O
one O
run O
away O

Very O
adequate O
. O

powerful O
, O
folds O
up O
and O
the O
cord O
retractor O
is O
strong O
. O

So O
far O
it O
works O
very O
well O
, O
however O
when O
I O
first O
turned O
it O
on O
it O
smoked O
a O
little O
, O
A O
very O
tiny O
amount O
. O
  O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
that O
's O
normal O
or O
its O
going O
to O
explode O
, O
I O
will O
write O
another O
review O
if O
the O
worst O
happens O
. O

I O
like O
this O
dryer O
, O
it O
's O
light O
& O
does O
what O
it O
's O
suppose O
to O
. O
The O
only O
issue O
I O
haveis O
it O
does O
n't O
get O
as O
hot O
as O
my O
last O
dryer O
- O
It O
's O
not O
by O
any O
means O
cold O
- O
just O
a O
littleless O
warm O
that O
what O
I O
would O
Ideally O
like O
. O
But O
, O
it O
works O
very O
well O
for O
the O
price O
. O

Works O
really O
well O
and O
retractable O
cord O
is O
great O
for O
storage O
. O
  O
This O
dryer O
is O
lightweight O
and O
I O
love O
the O
different O
heat O
settings O
. O
  O
Only O
negative O
is O
cord O
button O
is O
a O
little O
hard O
to O
push O
. O

Worked O
for O
a O
while O
. O
Then O
, O
it O
broke O
. O
I O
bought O
it O
a O
month O
ago O
. O
DO O
NOT O
BUY O
IT O
! O

Works O
great O
! O

I O
purchased O
this O
to O
go O
with O
my O
Rusk O
W8less O
Professional O
Hair O
Dryer O
and O
it O
fits O
perfectly O
! O
I O
love O
that O
the O
bowl O
is O
large O
and O
really O
deep O
. O
This O
is O
a O
must O
- O
have O
for O
curly O
hair O
! O

BUENO O

I O
have O
n't O
owned O
a O
blow O
dryer O
in O
over O
three O
years O
. O
I O
chopped O
off O
all O
my O
hair O
( O
I O
had O
about O
1/2 O
of O
hair O
left O
) O
to O
go O
chemical O
- O
free O
. O
Now O
, O
three O
years O
later O
, O
my O
hair O
is O
super O
thick O
and O
well O
past O
my O
shoulders O
again O
. O
I O
'm O
able O
to O
let O
my O
hair O
air O
- O
dry O
, O
but O
sometimes O
even O
after O
24 O
hours O
, O
my O
hair O
is O
n't O
fully O
dry O
. O
I O
was O
excited O
to O
get O
this O
blow O
dryer O
to O
review O
on O
my O
blog O
. O
Sure O
, O
air O
- O
drying O
is O
less O
time O
- O
consuming O
and O
I O
'm O
able O
to O
do O
other O
things O
while O
my O
hair O
dries O
, O
but O
NOW O
I O
know O
what O
I O
was O
missing O
when O
I O
did O
n't O
need O
a O
hair O
dryer!If O
I O
have O
my O
hair O
styled O
and O
I O
get O
in O
the O
shower O
, O
I O
can O
guarantee O
my O
curled O
hair O
will O
be O
wet O
. O
A O
wet O
curl O
does O
n't O
look O
good O
on O
anybody O
! O
With O
this O
blow O
dryer O
, O
I O
can O
quickly O
dry O
my O
all O
my O
hair O
or O
just O
a O
section O
because O
it O
comes O
with O
a O
concentrated O
air O
flow O
attachment O
. O
The O
buttons O
are O
self O
- O
explanatory O
. O
You O
have O
the O
cool O
blast O
button O
, O
the O
degree O
of O
heat O
button O
, O
and O
the O
force O
of O
air O
button O
. O
They O
are O
easy O
to O
press O
and O
easy O
to O
remember O
where O
they O
are O
when O
the O
blow O
dryer O
is O
up O
in O
the O
air O
against O
my O
hair O
. O
Since O
this O
is O
the O
first O
blow O
dryer O
I O
've O
owned O
and O
used O
since O
late O
2011 O
, O
I O
give O
it O
two O
thumbs O
up O
. O
It O
's O
a O
great O
blow O
dryer O
for O
the O
price O
you O
pay O
. O
It O
feels O
natural O
in O
my O
hands O
, O
and O
again O
, O
this O
is O
after O
not O
handling O
one O
in O
over O
three O
years O
. O
( O
Christmas O
2015 O
will O
be O
my O
4th O
year O
. O
) O

This O
is O
definitely O
a O
powerful O
compact O
dryer O
. O
  O
I O
took O
this O
on O
a O
vacation O
with O
me O
, O
and O
it O
fit O
pretty O
well O
in O
my O
backpack O
, O
where O
I O
only O
traveled O
with O
a O
carry O
on O
bag O
. O
  O
There O
are O
only O
two O
settings O
, O
but O
it O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
. O
  O
I O
have O
used O
full O
size O
blow O
dryers O
that O
do O
n't O
nearly O
come O
close O
to O
how O
powerful O
of O
a O
blast O
this O
one O
provides O
. O
  O
The O
plastic O
attachment O
that O
comes O
with O
it O
does O
n't O
fit O
very O
well O
, O
and O
it O
easily O
pops O
off O
, O
but O
overall O
this O
is O
a O
great O
dryer O
to O
use O
for O
travel O
or O
everyday O
use O
. O

Solid O
performance O
right O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

Love O
it O
.... O

So O
far O
this O
hair O
dryer O
is O
amazing O
. O
  O
I O
love O
the O
various O
settings O
which O
allows O
for O
less O
frizz O
. O
  O
It O
is O
heavier O
than O
my O
last O
hair O
dryer O
I O
owned O
( O
different O
brand O
) O
but O
I O
think O
it O
is O
because O
it O
is O
better O
constructed O
. O
  O
Drying O
time O
does O
seem O
a O
bit O
faster O
but O
hard O
to O
tell O
as O
my O
hair O
is O
thick O
. O

I O
hate O
most O
blow O
dryers O
. O
  O
They O
're O
either O
not O
hot O
enough O
or O
too O
expensive O
or O
they O
feel O
like O
they O
are O
blowing O
a O
soft O
spring O
breeze O
through O
my O
hair O
. O
  O
This O
one O
is O
perfect O
. O
  O
I O
have O
naturally O
wavy O
hair O
and O
blow O
it O
straight O
almost O
every O
day O
. O
  O
Either O
I O
'm O
loosing O
my O
mind O
or O
else O
this O
blow O
dryer O
really O
does O
make O
my O
hair O
feel O
softer O
. O
  O
Dries O
fast O
, O
too O
. O
Highly O
recommend O
. O

Worked O
great O
for O
a O
while O
. O
Tip O
of O
blow O
dryer O
broke O
off O
in O
first O
month O
, O
had O
to O
crazy O
glue O
it O
back O
on O
. O
Just O
died O
about O
a O
year O
later O
, O
no O
heat O
. O
It O
was O
a O
great O
price O
just O
wished O
it O
lasted O
longer O
. O

great O

Works O
well O
, O
but O
not O
as O
light O
and O
small O
as O
other O
travel O
dryers O
I O
have O
had O
. O

I O
'm O
a O
guy O
with O
medium O
length O
hair O
that O
needs O
a O
hair O
dryer O
to O
speed O
up O
the O
process O
. O
My O
last O
hair O
dryer O
was O
a O
vidal O
sassoon O
similiar O
to O
the O
size O
of O
this O
one O
and O
just O
very O
basic O

get O
a O
better O
quality O

Wish O

make O
a O
small O
, O
powerful O
hair O

for O

Anyways O
... O
I've O
never O
had O
an O
expensive O
hair O
dryer O
, O
I O
've O
always O
used O
a O
hair O
dryer O
that O
did O
n't O
cost O
me O
more O
than O
15 O
bucks O
and O
used O
it O
until O
it O
burst O
into O
flames O
. O
NEVER O
AGAIN O
. O
This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
the O
most O

thing O
ever O

color O
treated O

extremely O
damaged O

my O

. O
It O
's O
much O
quieter O
than O
my O
previous O
beast O
. O
The O
only O
issue O
I O
have O
is O
that O
its O
heavier O
than O
what O
I O
was O
used O
too O
, O
which O
is O
n't O
to O
say O
anything O
negative O
about O
the O
product O
, O
more O
so O
that O
I O
need O
to O
go O
to O
the O
gym O
more O
often O

is O
an O

I O
wanted O

happen O
. O
That O
, O
and O
the O
item O
despite O
being O
lemon O
, O
it O
felt O
like O
decent O

. O
Might O
try O
another O
one O

maybe O
there O
was O
a O
batch O
batch O

I O
feel O
this O
is O
a O
very O
good O
product O

  O
It O
is O
a O
bit O
heavy O
and O
does O
n't O
get O
very O
hot O

  O
But O
overall O
it O
does O
a O
great O
job O

love O

Wish O
it O
had O
more O

when O

her O

would O
have O
nothing O

another O

  O
By O
the O
way O
, O
this O

has O
a O
4 O
year O

so O
keep O
your O
receipt O

  O
( O
In O
our O
case O
, O
the O
dryer O
was O
about O
2 O
years O
old O
but O
we O
no O
longer O
had O
the O
receipt O
, O
and O
the O
breakage O
was O
due O
to O
her O
dropping O
it O
and O
the O
fan O
speed O
switch O
physically O
broke O

so O
I O
appropriated O
the O
old O
dryer O
, O
wired O
the O
fan O

to O
permanent O
high O
and O
the O
old O
hair O

now O
resides O
in O
my O
workbench O
to O
serve O
as O
my O
hot O

gun O
when O
I O
need O
one).Not O
cheap O
, O
but O
a O
very O
high O

worth O
the O
price O
for O
us O
. O
  O
By O
the O
way O
, O
the O
Amazon O
price O
was O
by O
far O
the O
best O
we O
could O
find O
at O
the O
time O
we O
bought O
this O
replacement O
. O

Very O
nice O
looking O
blow O
dryer O
and O
performs O
great O
too O
! O
It O
is O
a O
replacement O
for O
another O
Conair O
that O
I O
bought O
about O
10 O
years O
ago O
..... O
I O
highly O
recommend O
it O
if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
an O
inexpensive O
Ionic O
Blow O
dryer O
! O

Both O
of O
my O
daughters O
have O
/ O
had O
this O
dryer O
and O
both O
of O
the O
dryers O
melted O
in O
different O
spots O
. O
  O
The O
dryers O
are O
fairly O
new O
and O
seem O
to O
be O
quite O
the O
fire O
hazard O
. O
  O
Obviously O
there O
is O
something O
wrong O
with O
this O
device O
since O
so O
many O
people O
are O
having O
this O
problem O
. O
  O
DO O
NOT O
PURCHASE O
THIS O
DRYER O
! O

Perfect O
! O

I O
got O
the O
wrong O
one O

I O
bought O
this O
in O
order O
to O
smooth O
out O
the O
wrinkles O
of O
the O
3 O
M O
Indoor O
Window O
Insulator O
Kit O
, O
and O
it O
worked O
perfectly O
for O
that O
purpose O
, O
especially O
at O
the O
highest O
setting O
and O
with O
the O
concentrator O
nozzle O
attachment O
. O
It O
did O
not O
get O
super O
hot O
( O
which O
was O
good O
for O
the O
window O
kit O
) O
, O
though O
I O
have O
no O
idea O
if O
that O
's O
good O
or O
bad O
from O
a O
hair O
drying O
perspective O
. O
I O
could O
have O
bought O
a O
cheaper O
hair O
dryer O
, O
but O
I O
chose O
this O
one O
because O
it O
is O
tourmaline O
ceramic O
, O
ionic O
, O
has O
several O
attachments O
, O
and O
multiple O
settings O
including O
a O
cool O
breeze O
setting O
-- O
all O
with O
the O
idea O
that O
after O
I O
was O
done O
using O
it O
on O
the O
window O
kit O
, O
I O
could O
provide O
it O
to O
female O
guests O
. O
This O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
good O
idea O
, O
since O
my O
housemate O
's O
younger O
sister O
is O
currently O
visiting O
, O
and O
she O
was O
happy O
that O
I O
had O
a O
hair O
dryer O
for O
her O
to O
use O
. O
I O
asked O
for O
her O
opinion O
, O
and O
she O
says O
, O
It O
's O
great O
. O
Pressed O
for O
more O
details O
, O
she O
says O
, O
I O
like O
that O
it O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
different O
settings O
. O
As O
it O
turns O
out O
, O
this O
is O
in O
fact O
the O
first O
hair O
dryer O
she O
has O
ever O
used O
. O
So O
I O
might O
also O
recommend O
reading O
some O
of O
the O
other O
reviews O
... O
:) O

Love O
it O
! O
! O

I O
bought O
for O
my O
wife O
. O
My O
wife O
choose O
this O
one O
. O
She O
said O
it O
works O
very O
good O
. O
She O
likes O
it O
. O
But O
little O
heavy O
. O

BUY O
THIS O
PEOPLE O
. O
VERY O
STRONG O
! O

The O
velvety O
outer O
coating O
on O
the O
hairdryer O
started O
to O
peel O
off O
after O
about O
three O
weeks O
. O
It O
rubbed O
off O
around O
the O
handle O
and O
nozzle O
, O
flinging O
bits O
of O
the O
paint O
( O
or O
whatever O
that O
was O
) O
into O
my O
hair O
and O
on O
my O
floor-- O
one O
day O
I O
tried O
to O
just O
rub O
all O
of O
it O
off O
but O
it O
just O
made O
a O
bigger O
mess O
. O
The O
dryer O
itself O
was O
just O
fine O
, O
just O
that O
damn O
clear O
coating O
paint O
looked O
awful O
and O
got O
all O
over O
the O
place O
. O
The O
only O
thing O
I O
can O
liken O
it O
to O
is O
one O
of O
those O
clear O
facial O
masks O
that O
you O
can O
peel O
off O
. O
I O
ended O
up O
having O
to O
buy O
a O
new O
hairdryer O
a O
month O
after O
buying O
this O
one O
. O
Buy O
another O
model O
. O

Can O
I O
just O
say O
that O
this O
is O
my O
SECOND O
hair O
dryer O
by O
Remington O
? O
I O
loved O
my O
first O
one O
so O
much O
that O
I O
wore O
it O
out O
! O
( O
A O
one O
to O
many O
drops O
on O
the O
floor O
after O
a O
few O
years O
) O

The O
diffuser O
works O
well O
... O
when O
it O
is O
n't O
falling O
off O
my O
dryer O
. O
I O
just O
bought O
a O
Conair O
276R O
Infiniti O
Pro O
Volume O
Dryer O
, O
and O
the O
diffuser O
starts O
to O
pop O
off O
the O
hair O
dryer O
once O
the O
unit O
warms O
up O
. O
I O
would O
n't O
recommend O
it O
for O
this O
hair O
dryer O
, O
but O
it O
might O
work O
well O
for O
others O
. O

Nice O
work O

worth O
it O
! O

works O
well O
so O
far O
. O
  O
temp O
not O
as O
warm O
as O
I O
would O
have O
expected O
compared O
to O
other O
manufacturers O
' O
products O
; O
and O
the O
air O
velocity O
not O
as O
good O
even O
with O
concentrator O
- O
but O
acceptable O
. O
4 O
not O
5 O
stars O
. O

Love O
the O
product O
! O

Love O
the O
power O
of O
this O
! O

best O
ever O
. O
  O
we O
have O
owned O
2 O
. O

Working O
out O
well O
. O

It O
rewinds O
every O
time O
! O
  O
Has O
the O
usual O
features O
, O
is O
priced O
well O
and O
except O
for O
the O
purple O
exotic O
feature O
, O
it O
blends O
well O
in O
the O
bathroom O
. O

It O
works O
well O
for O
me O
. O

works O
well O
the O
only O
problem O
is O
the O
tip O
wo O
nt O
stay O
on O

Super O
! O

Product O
came O
quickly O
but O
not O
sure O
I O
'd O
buy O
it O
again O
. O
The O
attachment O
falls O
off O
very O
easily O
. O

As O
with O
what O
the O
other O
1 O
* O
revers O
state O
this O
is O
not O
a O
good O
device O
at O
all O
. O
The O
problem O
I O
had O
with O
it O
however O
was O
not O
issues O
with O
quality O
of O
the O
overall O
products O
but O
more O
with O
the O
heat O
element O
! O
This O
thing O
could O
n't O
heat O
up O
and O
when O
it O
got O
there O
it O
could O
not O
hold O
its O
temperature O
! O
I O
found O
this O
astounding O
considering O
! O
I O
sent O
this O
back O
on O
got O
this O
babyliss O
  O
It O
is O
of O
much O
higher O
quality O
! O

This O
blow O
dryer O
is O
generally O
nice O
. O
The O
only O
thing O
that O
I O
do O
not O
like O
is O
that O
it O
does O
not O
have O
temp O
. O
and O
speed O
settings O
. O
It O
only O
has O
low O
temp./low O
speed O
, O
medium O
temp O
/ O
medium O
speed O
, O
and O
high O
temp./high O
speed O
. O
You O
can O
not O
change O
these O
corresponding O
temp./speed O
settings O
. O
Other O
than O
this O
I O
like O
the O
wide O
tooth O
comb O
attachment O
. O
I O
have O
natural O
hair O
and O
this O
helps O
me O
detangle O
and O
stretch O
all O
of O
my O
hair O
. O
It O
works O
pretty O
great O
, O
came O
on O
time O
. O
My O
mom O
is O
buying O
two O
for O
herself O
and O
my O
sister O
. O
I O
would O
recommend O
this O
. O

Great O
price O
, O
standard O
shipping O
, O
nice O
product O

This O
was O
bought O
for O
my O
daughter O
. O
Mine O
is O
about O
7 O
years O
old O
, O
and O
this O
one O
is O
just O
as O
good O
as O
mine O
. O

awesome O
! O
! O

Some O
people O
described O
this O
as O
being O
very O
light O
. O
I O
would O
say O
it O
's O
normal O
. O
It O
does O
n't O
put O
out O
a O
ton O
of O
air O
and O
it O
does O
n't O
feel O
very O
hot O
, O
but O
it O
somehow O
gets O
my O
hair O
dry O
as O
fast O
as O
my O
old O
hair O
dryer O
, O
and O
that O
's O
all O
I O
care O
about O
. O

works O
great O
! O
i O
m O
pretty O
picky O
about O
everything O
, O
but O
I O
'd O
buy O
this O
again O
and O
again O
! O

This O
is O
my O
first O
T3 O
blow O
dryer O
and O
my O
last O
. O
  O
I O
purchased O
this O
hair O
dryer O
last O
September O
at O
the O
recommendation O
of O
my O
sister O
. O
  O
Paying O
over O
$ O
100 O
for O
a O
blow O
dryer O
is O
a O
lot O
in O
my O
opinion O
if O
you O
are O
not O
a O
stylist O
. O
  O
It O
has O
a O
cool O
air O
button O
which O
will O
not O
turn O
off O
now O
. O
  O
I O
ca O
n't O
get O
even O
warm O
air O
to O
blow O
out O
of O
it O
. O
  O
And O
by O
the O
way O
, O
my O
sister O
's O
T3 O
blow O
dryer O
stopped O
working O
as O
well O
. O
  O
NOT O
WORTH O
THE O
$ O
$ O
$ O
$ O
. O

Wife O
and O
daughter O
love O
it O
. O
  O
They O
fight O
over O
it O
. O
Ha O

Does O
everything O
a O
hair O
dryer O
should O
do O
. O
Sturdy O
, O
nice O
design O
, O
powerful O
, O
and O
totally O
blows O
. O
In O
a O
good O
way O
. O

This O
could O
be O
my O
own O
incorrect O
expectations O
, O
but O
when O
they O
say O
it O
diffuses O
it O
REALLY O
diffuses O
. O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
'm O
not O
getting O
enough O
heat O
in O
any O
one O
place O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
, O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
use O
it O
at O
all O
. O
It O
's O
well O
made O
and O
clearly O
does O
what O
it O
says O
, O
but O
since O
it O
's O
effectively O
useless O
to O
me O
three O
stars O
is O
the O
most O
I O
can O
do O
. O

Xtava O
Blue O
Professional O
Hair O
Dryer O
is O
awesome O
. O
I O
have O
used O
it O
several O
times O
this O
week O
and O
I O
am O
super O
thrilled O
with O
it O
. O
The O
heat O
can O
be O
set O
to O
low O
, O
medium O
, O
or O
high O
depending O
on O
your O
preference O
. O
I O
really O
like O
that O
. O
Because O
when O
the O
weather O
is O
hot O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
always O
want O
to O
feel O
a O
hot O
breeze O
in O
my O
face O
. O
I O
prefer O
it O
to O
be O
medium O
or O
else O
I O
start O
sweating O
. O
My O
former O
blow O
dryer O
only O
had O
the O
hot O
setting O
, O
so O
this O
is O
a O
great O
advantage O
for O
me O
. O
Also O
this O
hair O
dryer O
is O
great O
because O
it O
has O
a O
cool O
switch O
, O
a O
button O
you O
can O
press O
to O
get O
a O
quick O
shot O
of O
cool O
air O
occasionally O
. O
I O
love O
that O
it O
has O
a O
wind O
controlling O
cone O
that O
can O
be O
added O
to O
the O
dryer O
for O
styling O
! O
I O
like O
to O
use O
a O
round O
brush O
to O
make O
the O
ends O
of O
my O
hair O
curl O
under O
sometimes O
while O
blow O
drying O
...... O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
my O
hair O
blowing O
every O
which O
way O
lol O
. O
So O
this O
is O
just O
perfect O
. O
I O
really O
truly O
love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
So O
happy O
with O
it O
. O
Works O
very O
well O
. O
Runs O
great O
. O
Makes O
my O
hair O
look O
beautiful O
. O
Mission O
accomplished O
. O
So O
glad O
I O
got O
to O
try O
this O
in O
exchange O
for O
a O
review O
. O

Works O
well O

New O
favorite O
dryer O
for O
professional O
use O
. O
I O
am O
a O
stylist O
and O
having O
the O
right O
dryer O
makes O
all O
the O
difference O
. O
This O
things O
blows O
hard O
and O
gets O
hot O
. O
I O
use O
it O
on O
medium O
heat O
and O
low O
speed O
and O
still O
cut O
my O
drying O
time O
in O
half O
with O
gorgeous O
results O
. O
Very O
little O
need O
for O
curling O
iron O
or O
flat O
irons O
when O
done O
. O
Time O
saver O
, O
light O

I O
even O
like O
the O
diffuser O
: O

Graduation O
gift O
for O
my O
niece O
. O
  O
She O
loved O
it O
. O
  O
Especially O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
cord O
disappears O
into O
it O
..... O

My O
son O
loves O
it O
, O
dries O
quickly O
and O
is O
very O
strong O
! O

This O
is O
a O
great O
unit O
to O
organize O
the O
bathroom O
. O
I O
'm O
not O
a O
fan O
of O
stowing O
the O
hair O
dryer O
away O
in O
a O
cabinet O
or O
drawer O
and O
taking O
it O
out O
for O
every O
use O
and O
I O
'm O
not O
a O
fan O
of O
having O
it O
sit O
on O
the O
counter O
all O
of O
the O
time O
. O
This O
is O
a O
great O
compromise O
. O
The O
unit O
is O
always O
ready O
to O
use O
and O
it O
does O
n't O
take O
up O
space O
. O
Also O
, O
I O
am O
not O
able O
to O
mount O
this O
in O
studs O
, O
so O
I O
was O
concerned O
that O
the O
constant O
off O
and O
on O
might O
loosen O
this O
unit O
on O
the O
wall O
. O
There O
's O
no O
problem O
with O
that O
. O
I O
even O
bought O
an O
extra O
one O
for O
my O
kids O
' O
bathroom O
-- O
and O
you O
know O
how O
kids O
can O
be O
rough O
. O
Both O
units O
are O
fine O
and O
show O
no O
sign O
of O
loosening O
. O
Lastly O
, O
it O
's O
easy O
to O
install O
. O
Love O
that O
part O
. O
I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
product O
. O

It O
is O
ok O

These O
are O
nice O
hair O
dryers O
. O
  O
I O
bought O
one O
for O
myself O
and O
one O
for O
my O
husband O
- O
they O
're O
great O
. O
  O
Every O
time O
a O
guest O
has O
used O
mine O
they O
comment O
on O
how O
nice O
it O
is O
. O
  O
Feels O
like O

the O
salon O
. O

Love O
the O
lightweight O
design O
. O
Works O

Awesome O

I O

6 O
months O
, O
and O
the O
cable O
retraction O
is O
not O

as O
well O
because O
the O
