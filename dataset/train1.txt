so B-dryingspeed
fast L-dryingspeed
, O
and O
seems O
to O
do O
so O
without O

... O
I O
was O
wavering O
between O
this O
dryer O
and O
another O
that O
was O
a O
bit O
cheaper U-price
. O
But O
was O
glad U-quality
that O
I O
chose O
this O
one O
, O
as O
it O
's O
the O
most B-quality
satisfying L-quality
hair O
dryer O
I O
've O
used O
at O
home O
thus O
far O
. O
My O
only O
issue O
with O
it O
is O
that O
the O
sliding O
switches O
are O
annoying O
to O
use O
, O
as O
they O
are O
very O
stiff O
. O
Wish O
that O
this O
awesome U-quality
product O
came O
with O
easier O
to O
maneuver O
switches O
.... O
Maybe O
next O
time O
, O
in O
the O
redesign O
, O
it O
will O
? O

Great U-quality
! O
Everything O
I O
expected O
from O
Conair O
. O
MORE O
than O
enough O
heat U-temperature
for O
my O
thick O
curly O
hair O
. O
Love U-quality
it O
! O

Except O
not O
drying O
at O
back O
of O
head O
well O
it O
is O
very O
satisfactory U-quality

The O
brush U-attachment
on O
this O
is O
like O
a O
baby O
's O
brush O
it O
did O
not O
brush O
through O
my O
hair O
. O
Terrible U-quality
do O
n't O
waste B-quality
your I-quality
time L-quality
buying O
. O
Price U-price
is O
great U-quality
but O
brush O
is O
n't O

When O
I O
plugged O
in O
this O
dryer O
and O
used O
it O
the O
first O
time O
, O
I O
was O
absolutely B-quality
amazed L-quality
with O
how O
quickly U-dryingspeed
it O
dried O
my O
hair O
, O
how O
well O
it O
straightened O
my O
naturally O
wavy O
hair O
, O
and O
how O
much O
shinier O
and O
healthier O
it O
made O
my O
hair O
look O
when O
I O
was O
done O
too!It O
took O
me O
about O
4 O
minutes O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
with O
my O
Xtava O
hair O
dryer O
, O
which O
is O
amazing U-quality
for O
me O
! O
My O
hair O
is O
super O
long O
and O
super O
thick O
and O
usually O
takes O
7 O
minutes O
at O
the O
fastest O
, O
especially O
when O
my O
hair O
is O
still O
pretty O
wet O
because O
I O
pretty O
much O
just O
got O
out O
of O
the O
shower O
. O
I O
was O
absolutely O
stunned O
by O
the O
drying O
time O
. O
In O
fact O
, O
it O
dried O
my O
hair O
faster O
than O
my O
much O
more O
expensive O
dryer O
I O
've O
been O
using O
for O
the O
last O
few O
years O
. O
I O
used O
it O
on O
the O
highest O
heat O
setting O
and O
and O
speed O
setting O
. O
You O
can O
dry O
it O
slower O
if O
you O
like O
, O
but O
I O
read O
somewhere O
awhile O
back O
that O
it O
's O
better O
to O
dry O
on O
a O
higher O
speed O
and O
higher O
temp O
, O
and O
get O
the O
heat O
off O
your O
hair O
as O
quickly O
as O
possible O
, O
so O
that O
s O
just O
how O
I O
've O
always O
dried O
my O
hair O
. O
Plus O
I O
'm O
usually O
in O
a O
big O
hurry O
so O
this O
works O
best O
for O
me O
. O
Once O
dried O
, O
I O
then O
blasted O
my O
hair O
with O
the O
cool O
setting O
, O
which O
worked O
really O
great O
and O
really O
made O
my O
hair O
less O
frizzy O
and O
gave O
it O
instant O
shine O
and O
made O
it O
look O
healthier O
too!While O
using O
this O
dryer O
the O
last O
week O
, O
I O
have O
also O
noticed O
my O
hair O
has O
been O
much O
less O
frizzier O
too O
, O
especially O
for O
this O
time O
of O
year O
! O
It O
's O
so O
cold O
and O
dry O
here O
, O
my O
hair O
usually O
goes O
POOF O
! O
As O
soon O
as O
I O
walk O
out O
the O
door O
, O
but O
my O
hair O
has O
been O
surprisingly O
tame O
this O
week O
, O
I O
think O
in O
thanks O
to O
my O
new O
Xtava O
Blowdryer!I O
also O
love O
that O
this O
hair O
dryer O
comes O
with O
a O
customized O
concentration O
nozzle O
so O
I O
can O
deliver O
lots O
of O
heat O
to O
one O
specific O
area O
. O
I O
did O
n't O
always O
dry O
my O
hair O
this O
way O
until O
recently O
, O
but O
I O
've O
found O
it O
really O
dries O
your O
hair O
so O
much O
faster!This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
also O
quite O
noticeably O
lightweight O
! O
I O
was O
surprised O
when O
I O
picked O
it O
up O
when O
I O
first O
opened O
the O
package O
. O
I O
love O
that O
you O
can O
hold O
it O
on O
your O
hair O
for O
several O
minutes O
and O
never O
get O
that O
tired O
, O
dead O
arm O
, O
from O
holding O
a O
heavy O
blowdryer!My O
only O
complaint O
about O
this O
dryer O
is O
I O
wish O
the O
cord O
was O
a O
little O
bit O
longer O
, O
but O
that O
's O
just O
because O
I O
move O
around O
the O
bathroom O
a O
lot O
doing O
stuff O
while O
drying O
my O
hair O
because O
I O
have O

in O
the O

and O
ca O
n't O
sit O
still O
just O
doing O
my O

! O
Otherwise O
, O
it O
has O
perfect O

standing O
in O
front O
of O
the O
mirror O
and O
bending O
over O

your O
hair!I'm O
completely O

Bought O
it O
for O
my O
wife O
because O
her O
cheap U-price
hairdryer O
was O
extremely O
loud U-noisy
and O
woke O
me O
up O
. O
  O
This O
one O
is O
awesome U-quality
. O
  O
Super O
quiet U-noisy
and O
she O
loves U-quality
it O
. O
  O
It O
is O
quiet U-noisy
enough O
that O
we O
can O
actually O
talk O
while O
she O
drys O
her O
hair O
. O
  O
That O
would O
never O
have O
happened O
with O
the O
old O
dryer O
. O
  O
She O
says O
it O
takes O
about O
5 B-dryingspeed
minutes L-dryingspeed
longer U-dryingspeed
to O
dry O
her O
hair O
, O
but O
that O
is O
because O
she O
only O
uses O
it O
on O
medium B-temperature
heat L-temperature
. O
  O
High B-temperature
heat L-temperature
is O
very O
hot U-temperature

she O

it O
will O
hurt O
her O

The O

con O
is O
the O

not O

  O
My O
only O

is O
that O
it O

kind O

I O
'd O
definitely B-quality

My O
wife O
does O
hair O
and O
her O
old O
dryer O
went O
out O
. O
Saw O
these O
and O
bought O
2 O
. O
OMG U-quality
clients O
do O
NOT O
sit O
under O
the O
dryer O
long O
at O
all O
. O
Will B-expectation
be L-expectation
buying O
another O
one O
soon O
. O

Wow U-quality
. O
  O
This O
thing O
is O
great!No -
, O
it O
's O
not O
as O
powerful U-power
or O
capable O
as O
a O
full O
- O
sized O
dryer O
. O
  O
But O
, O
what O
do O
you O
expect O
from O
something O
that O
literally O
fits O
in O
the O
palm O
of O
your O
hand O
? O
  O
I O
, O
myself O
, O
expect O
a O
lot O
less O
than O
this O
dryer O
delivers O
. O
Unlike O
a O
lot O
of O
travel O
hair O
dryers O
, O
this O
one O
locates O
the O
fan O
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
barrel O
and O
has O
some O
barrel O
length O
to O
it O
. O
  O
This O
lines O
the O
airflow O
up O
giving O
a O
useful O
stream O
of O
air O
instead O
of O
the O
every O
- O
which O
- O
way O
mess O
of O
air O
that O
most O
travel O
dryers O
produce O
. O
  O
It O
's O
not O
as O
directional O
as O
a O
full O
- O
sized O
dryer O
with O
a O
longer O
barrel O
, O
but O
it O
's O
better O
than O
most O
travel O
dryers O
. O
One O
reviewer O
reported O
that O
the O
controls O
are O
not O
labeled O
. O
  O
This O
is O
not O
true O
on O
the O
dryer O
I O
received O
. O
  O
The O
Low O
/ O
Off O
/ O
High O
switch U-attachment
and O
the O
voltage O
selector O
are O
clearly O
marked O
. O
Several O
reviewers O
have O
complained O
of O
it O
making O
a O
very O
high O
- O
pitched O
motor O
noise O
, O
getting O
very O
hot O
, O
smelling O
bad O
, O
and O
then O
dying O
. O
  O
The O
unit O
is O
shipped O
set O
for O
125V O
( O
USA O
) O
power O
. O
  O
While O
it O
is O
true O
that O
many O
modern O
electronic O
devices O
have O
auto O
- O
ranging O
or O
universal O
AC O
inputs O
and O
work O
properly O
on O
any O
line O
voltage O
anywhere O
, O
this O
little O
hairdryer O
is O
n't O
one O
of O
them O
. O
  O
If O
you O
plug O
this O
dryer O
into O
250V O
( O
European O
) O
power O
without O
manually O
changing O
the O
voltage O
selector O
switch O
to O
the O
250V O
setting O
, O
the O
dryer O
will O
quickly O
fail O
exactly O
as O
described O
. O
  O
And O
that O
will O
be O
your O
fault O
, O
misuse O
, O
and O
not O
cause O
for O
a O
poor O
review O
. O
Mine O
has O
worked O
fine O
. O
  O
It O
drys O
my O
hair O
almost O
as O
fast U-dryingspeed
as O
my O
professional O
dryer O
at O
home O
. O
  O
Its O
size U-appearance
, O
weight U-usability
, O
and O
performance U-quality
make O
this O
an O
easy O
choice O
for O
travel U-scenario
. O

Kind O
of O
weak U-airflow

Did O
not O
expect O
much O
from O
such O
a O
cheap U-price
blow O
dryer O
, O
but O
this O
definitely O
exceeded B-quality
my I-quality
expectations L-quality
! O

the B-quality
best L-quality
compact O
hair O
dryer O
I O
ever O
own O
, O
great U-quality
for O
vacation B-scenario
travel L-scenario
. O

I O
love U-quality
it O
! O
Heats B-temperature
up L-temperature
nice O
it O
is O
n't O
to O
heavy U-usability
the O
only O
down O
side O
is O
that O
by O
the O
switches O
I O
have O
a O
little O
gap O
and O
on O
the O
other O
side O
you O
can O
see O
glue O
holding O
it O
together O
. O
Also O
the O
item O
I O
was O
sent O
was O
clearly O
a O
return O
the O
box O
was O
open O
and O
nothing O
was O
in O
a O
plastic O
bag O
. O
So O
far O
so B-quality
good L-quality
but O
I O
really O
hope O
it O
holds O
up O

I O
've O
always O
been O
skeptical O
about O
new O
, O
amazing O
, O
breakthrough O
technology O
in O
beauty O
products O
. O
  O
I O
certainly O
believe O
there O
are O
different O
levels O
of O
quality O
and O
also O
that O
one O
product O
may O
perform O
better O
or O
worse O
on O
different O
people O
. O
  O
So O
I O
was O
hoping U-expectation
this O
dryer O
would O
make O
a O
difference O
, O
while O
being O
prepared O
for O
less O
than O
spectactular O
results O
. O
  O
So O
drum O
roll O
please O
... O
I O
personally O
thought O
my O
hair O
looked O
silkier O
, O
shinier O
and O
it O
did O
dry O
noticeably O
faster O
, O
but O
the O
shocker O
was O
that O
other O
people O
really O
noticed O
the O
difference!My O
adult O
daughters O
to O
whom O
I O
am O
often O
apparently O
invisible O
, O
both O
asked O
me O
individually O
and O
on O
seperate O
occassions O
if O
I O
had O
just O
had O
my O
hair O
done O
, O
and O
what O
had O
I O
done O
differently O
etc O
. O
  O
Ironically O
, O
the O
evening O
that O
I O
had O
in O
fact O
come O
straight O
from O
the O
salon O
( O
and O
prior O
to O
using O
this O
product O
) O
warranted O
no O
notice O
. O
  O
I O
've O
had O
others O
compliment O
my O
hair O
as O
well O
. O
  O
I O
'm O
giving O
more O
weight O
to O
those O
who O
see O
me O
all O
the O
time O
and O
tend O
not O
to O
use O
flattery O
to O
judge O
that O
there O
was O
a O
very O
noticable O
difference O
. O
  O
The O
other O
thing O
worth O
mentioning O
is O
that O
in O
my O
youth O
my O
hair O
was O
one O
of O
my O
best U-quality
assests O
in O
terms O
of O
appearance U-appearance
. O
  O
For O
the O
past O
10 O
years O
or O
so O
, O
its O
become O
a O
definite O
liability O
. O
  O
I O
joke O
that O
it O
's O
a O
fire O
hazard O
and O
I O
'm O
not O
allowed O
near O
open O
flame O
as O
it O
is O
so O
dry O
and O
so O
covered O
in O
product O
that O
its O
quite O
flammable O
. O
  O
I O
put O
a O
fair O
bit O
of O
effort O
into O
getting O
it O
to O
be O
healthier O
and O
less O
frizzy O
and O
I O
've O
actually O
had O
people O
ask O
me O
if O
I O
've O
ever O
tried O
a O
really O
good O
conditioner O
or O
anti O
- O
frizz O
product O
. O
  O
After O
what O
I O
hope O
is O
a O
chilling O
gaze O
I O
let O
them O
know O
I O
do O
believe O
I O
have O
tried O
nearly O
all O
conditioners O
/ O
styling O
products O
. O
So O
it O
is O
a O
rare O
thing O
indeed O
for O
me O
to O
rave O
about O
a O
hair O
product O
or O
in O
this O
case O
hair O
dryer O
and O
I O
must O
give O
it O
a O
rave O
review O
! O
  O
If O
you O
possess O
beautiful O
, O
soft O
, O
smooth O
heathly O
hair O
this O
may O
not O
be O
worth O
the O
money U-price
, O
  O
but O
if O
like O
me O
you O
color O
frequently O
and O
have O
those O
weird O
coarse O
alien O
hairs O
springing O
up O
randomly O
then O
I O
would O
say O
go O
for O
it O
! O

Very B-dryingspeed
fast L-dryingspeed
and O
rightly O
hot U-temperature
. O
Makes O
a O
bit O
of O
noise U-noisy
and O
heavier U-usability
than O
usual O
. O
But O
I O
still O
like U-quality
it O
, O
for O
its O
looks U-appearance
and O
quality U-quality
, O

I O
love U-quality
this O
hairdryer O
. O
  O
I O
really O
like U-quality
the O
retractable O
handle O
and O
the O
quietness U-noisy
of O
the O
dryer O
. O
  O
My O
old O
dryer O
was O
much O
louder U-noisy
. O

Enjoy U-quality
the O
settings U-attachment
for O
heat U-temperature
and O
power U-power
. O
Very O
sturdy O
. O
I O
have O
dropped O
it O
and O
the O
rubbery O
plastic O
is O
unscathed O
. O
It O
is O
a O
bit O
heavier U-usability
than O
others O
, O
but O
it O
seems O
well B-appearance
- I-appearance
made L-appearance

nice U-quality

Perfect U-quality
, O
drys O
my O
very O
thick O
and O
wavy O
hair O
super O
fast O
and O
for O
the O
first O
time O
ever O
I O
do O
n't O
need O
a O
straightener O
afterwards O
to O
smooth O
it O
out O
. O
  O
I O
do O
wish U-expectation
it O
came O
with O
a O

though O
. O

Pretty B-quality
good L-quality
Dryer O
. O
My O
only O
wish U-expectation
is O
that O
it O
blew O
a O
bit O
hotter U-temperature
on O
the O
max O
heat O
setting O
. O
It O
's O
very O
powerful U-power
however O
. O

I O
luv U-quality
this O
product O
.. O
it O
's O
not O
only O
attractive O
but O
it O
does O
what O
it O
said O
. O
Makes O
my O
hair O
soft O
& O
shinny O
. O

It O
definitely O
gets O
hot U-temperature
. O
Somewhat O
loud U-noisy
though O
. O

I O
wanted O
one O
that O
blows O
hard O
and O
I O
could O
control O
the O
temperature U-temperature
too O
.. O
this O
one O
works O
and O
the O
price U-price
was O
fair O
. O

lots O
of O
power U-power
in O
this O
little U-appearance
dryer O

I O
've O
had O
it O
for O
7 O
months O
and O
it O
's O
all O
but O
dead O
. O
Makes O
funny O
noises U-noisy
, O
smells O
like O
burning O
, O
changes O
strength O
. O
I O
've O
kept O
hairdryers O
for O
years O
and O
years O
before O
this O
one O
and O
have O
never O
had O
this O
problem O
. O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
'm O
going O

I O
used O

only O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
. O
Then O
when O
I O
turned O
it O
on O
it O
made O
a O
strange O
humming O
noise U-noisy
, O
started O
smoking O

and O
there O
were O
flames O
firing O
up O

the O

Yikes O

I O
What O
a O

She O
likes U-quality
it O

It O
is O
quiet U-noisy
, O
not O
too O
heavy O
, O
& O
dries O
quickly U-dryingspeed
. O
She O
stated O
that O
it O
was O
a O
bit O
large O
, O
but O
she O
was O
previously O
using O
a O
travel U-scenario
size U-appearance
as O
her O
everyday O
dryer O
. O

It O
's O
hard O
to O
believe O
a O
hair O
dryer O
could O
make O
a O
big O
difference O
but O
this O
one O
absolutely B-quality
DOES L-quality
. O
  O
I O
'm O
sooo O
thrilled O
with O
it O
! O
  O
My O
kinky O
/ O
curly O
fine O
/ O
thin O
hair O
has O
dried O
much O
faster O
than O
usual O
( O
even O
though O
it O
's O
the O
same O
wattage O
as O
my O
previous O
dryer O
) O
and O
so O
smooth O
, O
soft O
, O
shiny O
and O
healthy O
looking O
( O
getting O
that O
without O
a O
flat O
iron O
also O
means O
that O
it O
gets O
to O
stay O
fluffier O
looking O
instead O
of O
flat O
and O
stringy O
) O
. O
  O
-- O
I O
found O
it O
cheaper O
at O
Walmart O
, O
but O
it O
says O
it O
's O
a O
LIMITED O

you O
ca O
n't O

it O
has O
the O
cool O

  O
The O
really O
nice U-quality
thing O
if O
you O
use O
the O
end O
attachment U-attachment
that O
condenses O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
air O

, O
is O
that O
this O
dryer O
has O
a O
round O
end O
( O
not O
oval O
) O
so O
you O
can O
turn O
the O
attachment O
when O
you O
need O
to O
instead O
of O
holding O
your O

small U-appearance

I O
have O
had O
this O

The O

all O

a O
sudden O
it O
fell O
apart O
. O
The O
blow U-airflow
dryer O
started O
over O
heating O
and O
then O
it O
would O
shut O
off O
then O
the O
attachment U-attachment
would O
nt O
stay O
on O
anymore O

the O

I O

. O
  O
The O

the O
extra O

CONS O
: O
  O
It O
is O
the O
heaviest U-usability

I O
have O
ever O
owned O
, O
the O
buttons U-attachment
are O
so O

difficult O
to O
get O
a O
good O
grip O
w O
/ O
out O
changing O
a O

, O
& O
it O
takes O
a O
long O
time O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
( O
much O
longer O
than O
my O
last O
few O

did O
so O
many O
people O
rave O
about O
this O

  O
I O
do O
n't O

my O
money U-price
on O
several O
hair O
dryers O
that O
did O
n't O
measure O
up O
because O
the O
bonnets O
never O
fit O
tightly O
. O
They O
would O
n't O
stay O
on O
my O
head O
properly O
, O
the O
heat O
would O
seep O
out O

took O
hours O

dry O
my O
SHORT O
hair O
. O
  O
Now O

Very O

70 O

done O
with O
roller O
sets O

a O

under O
a O

So O
I O
feel O

this O

. O
IT O
ROCKS O
! O
The O
heat U-temperature
and O
air U-airflow
circulation O
are O
great U-quality
. O
Temperature O
and O
timer O
controls O
are O
simple O
and O
easy O
to O
use O
. O
The O
hood O
has O
a O
clear O
lift O
up O
portion O
on O
the O
hood O
front O
that O
allows O

Best O
of O
all O
, O
its O
quiet O

Instructions O
for O
assembly O
are O
very O
vague O

Just O
use O
your O
common O
sense O
and O
look O
at O
the O
pictures O
and O
you O
'll O
figure O
it O
out O
. O
I O
had O
mine O
together O
and O
running O
in O
about O
15 O
minutes O
. O
For O
the O
money U-price
I O
do O
n't O
think O
you O
could O
go O
wrong O
. O
The O
only O
thing O
I O
would O
change O
is O
the O
plastic O
legs O
. O
But O
what O
is O
n't O
plastic O
these O

Great U-quality
Hair O
Dryer O

I O
love U-quality
how O
quiet U-noisy
this O
blow O
dryer O
is O
. O
It O
has O
a O
comfortable U-comfort
grip O
on O
it O
and O
does O
a O
beautiful O
job O
of O
drying O
my O
hair O
without O
any O
frizz O
. O

I O
'm O
really O
satisfied U-quality
with O
this O
purchase O
, O
and O
I O
totally O
recommend U-quality
it O

Makes O
a O
noise U-noisy
like O
its O
broke O

Nothing O
to O
get O
excited O
about O
. O
It O
works B-quality
well L-quality
and O
I O
like O
the O
cool U-temperature
temperature U-temperature
setting U-attachment
. O
  O
The O
cord U-attachment
is O
much O
shorter O
than O
the O
hair O
dryer O
I O
had O
to O
replace O
. O

I O
have O
this O
for O
awhile O
now O
and O
it O
get O
s O
the O
job O
done O
after O
a O
long O
while O
of O
blow O
drying O
. O
It O
does O
n't O
get O
as O
hot O
as O
it O
supposed O
to O
and O
blows U-airflow
cool U-temperature
air U-airflow
when O
on O
hot O
. O
The O
colors U-appearance
are O
great U-quality
and O
it O
is O
light U-usability
weight U-usability
but O
if O
you O
have O
thick O
hair O
i O
would O
recommend U-quality
spending O
the O
extra O
money U-price
to O
get O
a O
better U-quality
hair O
dryer O
. O

Unusable U-quality
.... O
Bought O
for O
Mom O
to O
use O
to O
dry O
hair O
in O
rollers O
. O
The O
bonnet U-attachment
and O
closure U-attachment
is O
so O
tight O
and O
small U-appearance
there O
is O
no O
way O
to O
get O
it O
on O
or O
use O
it O
, O
even O
with O
small U-appearance
rollers O
and O
a O
small U-appearance
head O
! O

I O
liked U-quality
it O
, O
it O
was O
a O
present O
to O
my O
Son O
- O
in O
-Law O
. O
  O
He O
was O
happy U-quality
to O
receive O
it O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
any O
feedback O
yet O
. O
  O
They O
are O
out O
of O
state O
for O
visit O
. O

Basic O
hairdryer O
that O
folds O
. O
  O
It O
does O
n't O
seem O
like O
it O
is O
strong U-airflow
, O
but O
dries O
our O
long O
hair O
fast U-dryingspeed
. O
  O
Downside O
is O
that O
our O
hair O
gets O
sucked O
into O
it O
and O
that O
is O
n't O
fun O
! O
Need O
a O
better O
guard O
on O
it O
, O
but O
hey O
for O
the O
price O
I O
just O
hope O
it O
lasts O
longer O
than O
our O
last O
oneUPDATEDon't O
bother O
buying O
this O
brand O
. O
  O
We O
bought O
2 O
of O
them O
and O
they O
both O
died O
within O
a O
couple O
weeks O
of O
each O
other O
. O
  O
I O
wish O
someone O
made O
something O
that O
lasted O
longer O
than O
6 O
months O
! O
I O
know O
it O
was O
n't O
much O
money O
, O
but O
they O
should O
n't O
build O
them O
to O
fail O
in O
such O
a O
short O
time O
! O

As B-quality
advertised L-quality
! O

Adequate O
, O
not O
too O
loud U-noisy
, O
but O
only O
two O
temps O
and O
two O
speeds U-dryingspeed
. O
Since O
I O
knew O
the O
specs O
before O
I O
purchased O
, O
I O
was O
n't O
surprised O
, O
but O
I O
did O
expect O
the O
Hot U-temperature
setting U-attachment
to O
be O
warmer U-temperature
. O
The O
Warm U-temperature
is O
barely O
above O
cool O
. O

It O
is O
small U-appearance
, O
powerful U-power
and O
came O
with O
a O
carrying O
case O
so O
very O
useful O
for O
traveling U-scenario
. O
  O
It O
is O
dual O
voltage O
rated O
so O
easy B-usability
to I-usability
use L-usability
in O
USA O
or O
abroad O
. O
  O
I O
wish O
it O
came O
with O
plug O
adopter O
that O
are O
compatible O
with O
the O
pin O
arrangements O
in O
foreign O
countries O
. O
  O
For O
example O
, O
I O
travelled U-scenario
to O
Dubai O
and O
India O
, O
there O
they O
have O
three O
round O
pin O
plugs O
. O
  O
Without O
an O
adopter O
, O
you O
can O
not O
plug O
in O
this O
unit O
directly O
into O
the O
wall O
receptacle O
. O
  O
That O
can O
become O
a O
major O
problem O
. O

Maybe O
if O
it O

that O

the O
whole O

  O

the O

harder O

I O

We O
loved U-quality
the O

that O
we O

Very O
powerful U-power
fan O
, O
it O
seems O
my O

this O
is O
it O

huge O
difference O

I O
will O
never O
go O
back O

are O
amazing U-quality

But O
if O
you O
are O
limited O
by O
this O

, O
it O
is O
a O
great U-quality

I O
received O
this O
as O
a O
gift O
because O
I O
travel U-scenario
weekly O
. O
  O
Let O
me O
just O
say O
that O
this O
is O
the O
most O
amazing U-quality
small U-appearance
hair O
dryer O
that O
I O
have O
ever O
used O
. O
  O
I O
have O
very O
long O
and O
thick O
hair O
- O
almost O
to O
my O
waist O
- O
and O
I O
have O
never O
had O
a O
small O
blower O
dryer O
that O
could O
handle O
the O
length O
of O
time O
that O
it O
takes O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
until O
now O
. O
This O
one O
not O
only O
does O
it O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
even O
get O
hot O
to O
the O
touch O
! O
The O
size U-appearance
is O
what O
is O
so O
impressive O
as O
well O
! O
It O
truly O
is O
an O
amazing U-quality
tool O
! O
You O
will O
not O
regret O
this O
one O
. O
  O
I O
am O
considering O
ordering O
a O

and O
I O
've O
only O
had O
mine O
a O

one O
traveling O

! O

Died U-quality
within O
a O
couple O
months O

I O
am O
so O
disappointed U-quality
in O
the O
failing B-quality
quality L-quality
of O
Conair O

. O
Do O
the O

really O
need O
to O
be O
under O
our O
fingers O
the O
whole O
time O
? O

Wifey O
had O
one O
for O
8 O
years O
, O
w/o O
big O
issues O
; O
until O
it O
died U-quality
. O
She O
loves U-quality
it O
, O
and O
as O
a O
professional O
stylist O
she O
knows O
a O
thing O
ot O
two O
about O
the O
topic O
. O
I O
bought O
her O
another O
one O
for O
Christmas O
, O
so O
hopefully O
manufacture O
have O
n't O
change O
specs O
dated O
as O
previous O
one O
. O

Good U-quality
dryer O
for O
curly O
hair O

This O
is O
an O
awesome U-quality
blowdryer O
- O
it O
has O
cut O
my O
getting O
ready O
time O
by O
at O
least O
a O
third O
! O
Definitely O
recommend U-quality

This O
hair O
dryer O
works B-quality
reasonably I-quality
well L-quality
, O
but O
I O
beg O
to O
differ O
with O
a O
couple O
of O
the O
comments O
made O
by O
other O
reviewers O
of O
this O
model O
. O
First O
, O
this O
is O
NOT O
a O
particularly O
quiet U-noisy
hair O
dryer O
. O
Having O
been O
used O
to O
really O
quiet U-noisy
dryers O
in O
Europe O
, O
where O
the O
EU O
sets O
noise U-noisy
standards O
on O
such O
appliances O
, O
I O
have O
constantly O
been O
frustrated O
by O
the O
obnoxious O
noise U-noisy
levels O
of O
hair O
dryers O
here O
in O
the O
U.S. O
So O
, O
as O
American O
blow O
dryers O
go O
, O
this O
one O
is O
pretty O
good O
, O
especially O
on O
the O
SET O
setting O
, O
but O
it O
's O
certainly O
NOT O
exceptionally O
quiet U-noisy
. O
Nor O
is O
it O
lighter U-usability
in O
weight O
than O
the O
dryer O
I O
currently O
have O
. O
So O
buy O
it O
for O
the O
functionality O
, O
but O
not O
for O
the O
sound O
level O
or O
the O
weight U-usability
. O
However O
, O
one O
big O
advantage O
is O
that O
this O
dryer O
has O
a O
normal O
size O
plug O
, O
rather O
than O
the O
ginormous O
ones O
with O
the O
pop O
- O
out O
breaker O
that O
are O
common O
on O
other O
products O
sold O
in O
the O
U.S. O
Our O
bathroom O
outlets O
already O
have O
the O
pop O
- O
out O
breakers O
so O
we O
do O
n't O
need O
them O
on O
appliances O
used O
in O
the O
bathroom O
, O
so O
not O
having O
to O
accommodate O
the O
giant O
plug O
is O
a O
big O
plus O
. O

This O
Review O
is O
for O
the O
MEN O
ONLY O
. O
So O
I O
, O
the O
husband O
, O
bought O
this O
for O
my O
wife O
because O
she O
wanted O
something O
more O
powerful O
than O
1850 O
watts U-power
. O
So O
this O
was O
her O
Christmas O
Gift O
. O
Her O
old O
hair O
dryer O
took O
20 O
minutes O
to O
dry O
her O
hair O
and O
made O
it O
really O
frizzy O
( O
con O
- O
air O
brand O
) O
. O
She O
timed O
her O
drying O
with O
this O
BABBPK2000 O
Xtreme O
Pink O
Edition O
and O
it O
took O
only O
..... O
wait O
for O
it O
......... O
5 O
minutes O
and O
her O
hair O
was O
shiny O
with O
no O
frizz O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend U-quality
it O
! O

I O
got O
this O
to O
replace O
my O
gold O
' O
n O
hot U-temperature
one O
that O
I O
'd O
had O
for O
years O
. O
The O
brush U-attachment
attachment U-attachment
is O
very O
thin O
and O
pretty O
much O
useless O
in O
my O
thick O
hair O
. O
The O
gold O
n O
hot O
brush O
had O
way O
more O
bristles O
that O
were O
sturdier O
. O
Other O
than O
that O
, O
it O
hets O
hot U-temperature
and O
dries O
my O
hair O
, O
but O
not O
as O
straight O
as O
the O
gold O
n O
hot U-temperature
. O

Nice U-quality
blowdryer O
for O
the O
price U-price
! O

NOT O
VERY O
GOOD U-quality

I O
liked U-quality
it O
but O
ended O
up O
returning O
b O
/ O
c O
it O
was O
a O
bit O
heavy U-usability
for O
my O
arthritic O
hands O
. O

The O
needles U-attachment
were O
not O
log O
enough O
. O
  O
I O
RETURNED B-quality
IT L-quality

I O
like U-quality
how O
the O
cord U-attachment
goes O
inside.and O
the O
dryer O
works B-quality
great L-quality
. O
Agreat O
dryer O
that O
I O
would O
buy O
again O
. O
This O
did O
arrive O
on O
time O
. O
Thank B-quality
you L-quality
. O

I O
have O
wanted O
this O
for O
Christmas O
two O
years O
in O
a O
row O
and O
finally O
someone O
in O
my O
family O
purchased O
it O
, O
NOW O
they O
want B-quality
one L-quality
! O

I O
can O
not O
believe O
how O
great U-quality
this O
hairdryer O
really O
is O
. O
I O
searched O
and O
searched O
for O
months O
unsure O
of O
who O
to O
believe O
. O
I O
have O
fine O
hair O
, O
not O
the O
thick O
curly O
that O
drives O
most O
shoppers O
toward O
a O
certain O
brand O
. O
This O
one O
works B-quality
great L-quality
for O
my O
fine O
hair O
, O
and O
a O
plus O
is O
that O
I O
have O
not O
had O
static O
during O
the O
drying O
process O
like O
with O
the O
cheaper O
hairdryers O
. O
There O
are O
two O
settings O
for O
ionic O
, O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
the O
other O
setting O
is O
supposed O
to O
do O
, O
but O
the O
other O
setting O
does O
introduce O
static O
, O
so O
I O
use O
one O
ionic O
setting O
at O
all O
times O
. O
The O
main O
characteristic O
I O
searched O
for O
was O
the O
sound U-noisy
volume O
and O
pitch O
. O
Someone O
wrote O
a O
review O
that O
said O
they O
could O
actually O
hear O
the O
doorbell O
ring O
while O
using O
this O
hairdryer O
, O
and O
that O
convinced O
me O
to O
purchase O
this O
model O
. O
It O
is O
actually O
true O
- O
the O
pitch O
is O
not O
really O
a O
pitch O
, O
but O
rather O
a O
low O
sound O
that O
will O
save O
my O
eardrums O
. O
My O
husband O
can O
actually O
sleep O
when O
I O
blow O
dry O
, O
where O
he O
could O
not O
before O
. O
As O
for O
lasting O
ability O
, O
it O
is O
a O
quality O
hairdryer O
, O
and O
I O
have O
been O
using O
this O
for O
about O
6 O
months O
and O
it O
looks O
as O
though O
it O
will O
hold O
up O
for O
the O
long O
haul O
. O

Extremely O
heavy U-usability
and O
noisy U-noisy
. O
  O
returned O

Easy B-usability
to L-usability

together O
and O
works B-quality
well L-quality
. O

Super O
nice U-quality
hair O
dryer O
:) O

I O
would O
not O
buy O
this O
again O
. O
  O
It O
works B-quality
well L-quality
and O
does O
its O
purpose O
. O
  O
My O
complaints O
are O
it O
is O
heavy U-usability
and O
loud U-noisy
! O

Use B-quality
it I-quality

The O

If O
you O
have O
hair O
that O
takes O
FOREVER O
to O
dry O
, O
this O
is O
the O
hair O
dryer O
for O
you O
. O
  O
It O
not O
only O
dries O
your O
hair O
, O
but O
leaves O
it O
soft O
and O
shiny O
. O
I O
have O
personally O
gone O
through O
about O
15 O
different O
hair O
dryers O
to O
find O
the O
perfect U-quality
one O
. O
  O
I O
discovered O
the O
Remington O
Jet O
Dry O
Turbo O
about O
10 O
or O
15 O
years O
ago O
( O
it O
used O
to O
come O
in O
bluish O
/ O
purple O
) O
. O
During O
this O
time O
, O
I O
've O
often O
looked O
for O
other O
models O
just O
to O
see O
if O
I O
could O
find O
something O
better U-quality
, O
and O
there O
just O
is O
n't O
anything O
. O
  O
Many O
times O
, O
you O
'll O
find O
me O
using O
two O
hair O
dryers O
at O
the O
same O
time O
( O
which O
often O
causes O
the O
bathroom O
circuit O
to O
overload O
) O
. O
I O
used O
stylist O
models O
that O
cost O
around O
$ U-price
150 O
( O
Bespoke O
, O
Rusk O
Speed O
Freak O
, O
etc O
. O
) O
to O
Consumer O
Reports O
Best O
Hair O
Dryer O
- O
which O
I O
think O
the O
people O
who O
are O
reviewing O
them O
do O
n't O
have O
lots O
of O
hair O
... O
because O
nothing O
holds O
a O
candle O
to O
this O
model O
. O
They O
also O
have O
a O
compact U-appearance
one O
that O
I O
keep O
in O
my O
gym O
bag O
. O
  O
It O
's O
not O
as O
good U-quality
, O
but O
will O
do O
in O
a O
pinch O
. O

We O
got O
this O
one O
on B-price
sale L-price
for O
$ U-price
11 O
and O
it O
worked B-quality
just I-quality
fine L-quality
from O
March O
till O
December O
, O
then O
it O
quit O
, O
no O
heat U-temperature
and O
no O
fan O
. O
It O
was O
good O
when O
worked O
but O
due O
to O
short O
life O

I O
read O
all O
of O
the O
reviews O
and O
decided O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
buy O
this O
hairdryer O
in O
July O
2013 O
. O
It O
is O
a O
good U-quality
, O
quiet U-noisy
hairdryer O
that O
I O
enjoyed O
for O
16 O
months O
. O
However O
, O
just O
like O
the O
other O
reviews O
suggested O
, O
there O
is O
, O
indeed O
, O
a O

. O

I O
'm O
only O
giving O
these O
a O
3/5 O
for O
now O
becuase O
the O
heating U-temperature
element O
was O
broken O
on O
arrival O
. O
  O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
strange O
that O
it O
did O
n't O
get O
hot O
even O
on O
the O
highest O
heat O
setting O
...... O
it O
was O
still O
cool U-temperature
enough O
after O
several O
seconds O
that O
I O
could O
aim O
it O
directly O
at O
my O
face O
comfortably O
. O
  O
On O
the O
second O
try O
, O
it O
got O
hot O
for O
about O
5 O
seconds O
.... O
and O
then O
went O
cool O
again O
. O
  O
Third O
try O
- O
no O
heat O
. O
  O
I O
am O
glad O
I O
kept O
the O
box O
so O
I O
can O
send O
it O
back O
for O
my O
replacement O
. O
    O
So O
I O
am O
exchanging O
this O
for O
the O
same O
design O
in O
hopes O
that O
the O
replacement O
will O
have O
a O
working O
heating O
element O
. O
  O
I O
still O
rated O
it O
as O
a O
moderate O
success O
because O
the O
high O
and O
low O
settings U-attachment
for O
air O
, O
and O
the O
three O
temperature O
settings O
are O
a O
wonderful O
design O
. O
  O
It O
blows O
really O
hard O
, O
which O
is O
what O
I O
like O
. O
  O
I O
also O
am O
hoping O
the O
diffuser O
will O
allow O
me O
to O
maximize O
the O
wave O
in O
my O
hair O
for O
those O
days O
when O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
straighten O
it O
( O
or O
when O
it O
's O
humid O
outside O
) O
. O
  O
It O
's O
ilghtweight O
and O
has O
a O
nice O
feel O
to O
the O
grip O
. O
  O
I O
hope O
the O
replacement O
will O
up O
the O
rating O
to O
a O
full O
5 O
stars O
! O

( O
I O
might O
use O
this O
on O
the O
low O
blower O
setting O
to O
set O
a O

when O

. O
Testing O

on O
American O

and O
it O
is O
super O
powerful U-power
! O
A O
bit O
on O
the O
loud O
side O
but O
great U-quality
for O
the O

. O
Wonder O
if O
it O
will O
have O
the O
same O
quick O
drying O
on O
240v O
- O
they O
usually O
only O
work O
on O
low O
setting O
when O
you O
flip O
the O
voltage O
. O

This O
was O
purchased O
as O
a O
Christmas O
gift O
for O
someone O
other O
than O
myself O
. O
  O
She O
called O

a O
130 O

model O
which O
when O
plugged O
- O
in O
went O
bang O
. O
So O
can O
not O
review O
obviously O
. O
When O
I O
went O
back O
to O
check O
the O
voltage O
it O
was O
n't O
readily O
obvious O
what O
it O
was O
. O
It O
took O
quite O
a O
bit O
of O
searching O
to O
find O
out O
I O
had O
bought O
something O
unusable O
in O
Australia O

My O

  O
While O
the O
Babyliss O
feels O
much O
better U-quality
in O

the O
very O

out O
of O
past O
blow O
dryers O
. O
You O
make O
the O
decision O
. O

First O
used O
one O
of O
these O
in O
a O
hotel O
, O
and O
loved U-quality
it O
.. O
the O
retractable O
cord O
gets O
stuck O
, O
but O
still O
love U-quality
it O

Diffuser O
could O
be O
bigger U-appearance
. O
But O
it O
is B-quality
ok L-quality

I O
like U-quality

. O
It O

cool O
attached O
to O
my O
bathroom O
mirror O
. O
  O
I O
can O
round O
brush O
my O
hair O
much O
, O
much O
easier U-usability
, O
leaving O
my O
coif O
full O
and O
shiny O
! O

Love U-quality
it O
! O
Works B-quality
great L-quality
and O
is O
do O
quiet U-noisy
! O

My O
husband O
put O
it O
together O
and O
got O
to O
use O
it O
twice O
. O
So O
far O
so B-quality
good L-quality
, O
but O
you O
do O
need O
to O
be O
careful O
so O
it O
won O
' O
tip O
over O
. O
It O
is O
a O
really O
quiet O
machine O
and O
the O
ticking O
of O
the O
clock O
is O
really O
not O
that O
bad O
. O
If O
I O
did O
not O
hear O
the O
ticking O
I O
would O
not O
know O
if O
it O
was O
on O
or O
not O
. O
I O
can O
have O
a O
conversation O
with O
the O
person O
sitting O
under O
it O
that O
's O
how O
quiet O
it O
is O
and O
it O
gets O
really O
hot O
. O
My O
husband O
is O
thinking O
of O
placing O
more O
weight O
on O
the O
feet O
so O
it O
would O
be O
more O
stable O
. O
For O
the O
amount O
of O
money O
I O
think O
it O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

I O
tried O
to O
replace O
my O
old O
Conair O
Dual O
Voltage O
Travel O
Smart O
hairdryer O
. O
  O
Unfortunately O
this O
one O
was O
not O
very O
much O
like O
the O
old O
one O
. O
  O
This O
one O
is O
bigger U-appearance
and O
bulker O
, O
weighs O
quite O
a O
bit O
more O
, O
does O
not O
come O
with O
a O
carrying O
case O
, O
and O
does O
not O
have O
a O
built O
- O
in O
loop O
with O
which O
to O
hang O
from O
a O
hook O
. O
Also O
, O
it O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
two O
speed O
, O
but O
the O
low O
speed O
is O
too O
weak O
and O
delivers O
a O
stream O
of O
coolish O
air O
. O
  O
The O
high O
speed O
is O
too O
powerful O
and O
delivers O
an O
excessively O
hot O
stream O
of O
air O
. O
What O
a O
disappointment O
! O
! O
! O

I O
was O
extremely O
disappointed U-quality
in O
this O

  O
The O

was O
unable O
to O
change O

from O

warm U-temperature

  O
This O

ok O

I O
feel O
like O
this O
hair O
dryer O
is O
a O
little O
lacking O
in O
both O
heat O
and O
strength O
, O
but O
for O
the O
price O
I O
ca O
n't O
complain O
too O
much O
. O
I O
generally O
let O
me O
hair O
air O
dry O
or O
only O
use O
it O
for O
my O
bangs O

so O
it O
does O
the O
job O

If O
you O

a O
serious O
blow O

go O

Personally O
, O
I O
'll O
go O
for O
a O
different O
model O
next O
time O
, O
but O
in O
the O
meantime O
, O
I O
'm O
fine O
with O
it O
. O

There O
is O
no O
way O
you O
get O
a O
better U-quality

This O
one O

a O
flawless O
job O
! O
Very O
hot O
! O

Nice U-quality
machine O

I O
love U-quality
it O
. O
Always O
liked O
them O
when O
we O
stayed O
in O
hotels O
. O
Now O
I O
have O
my O
own O
. O

Received O
it O
today O
... O
the O
first O
thing O
that O
i O
did O
was O
blowdry O
my O
hair O
. O

As O
usual O
I O
have O
my O
wife O
test O
out O
the O
hair O
dryers O
as O
she O
is O
the O
one O
with O
the O
hair O
... O
I O
think O
the O
design O
is O
beautiful U-appearance
. O
She O
thinks O
the O
dryer O
is O
ugly U-appearance
. O
She O
said O
it O
's O
a O
high B-quality
quality L-quality
dryer O
, O
but O
overall O
she O
prefers O

Full O
Volume O
Hair O
Dryer O
( O
which O
costs O
something O
like O
75 O
% O
less O
than O
this O
model).My O
wife O
has O
thin O
hair O
which O
is O
easily O
damaged O
. O
She O
sees O
absolutely O
not O
difference O
with O
the O
Nanoe O
Technology O
. O
The O
ionizing O
and O
moisture O
- O
rich O
nanoe O
particles O
were O
dismissed O
by O
her O
as O
a O
marketing O
ploy O
. O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
about O
that O
but O
will O
say O
that O
at O
the O
very O
least O
mileage O
will O
vary O
. O
My O
wife O
DOES O
like O
the O
power O
, O
and O
the O
separate O
speed O
and O
temperature O
controls O
. O
My O
conclusion O
? O
If O
you O
have O
the O
money O
and O
like O
the O
design O
it O
's O
a O
well O
- O
built O
and O
very O
functional O
dryer O
. O
If O
you O
just O
want O
a O
good O
reliable O
dryer O
you O
can O
find O
good O
ones O
for O
far O
cheaper U-price
. O

Loves U-quality
it O
and O
it O
can O
blow O
cool U-temperature
air O
too O
. O
Very O
easy B-usability
to L-usability
use O
. O
Thanks O
again O

Wish U-expectation
it O
had O
a O
cooling O

about O
a O

I O
really O
like U-quality

( O
I O
have O
the O

generator O
on O
and O
use O
the O
concentrator O
. O
) O
Also O
the O
cord O
is O
a O
good O
length O
- O
about O
5 O
1/2 O
  O
to O
6 O

. O
long O
. O
( O
The O
cord O
on O
my O
last O
hair O
dryer O
was O
way O
too O
short O
. O
) O
I O
would O
recommend O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O

Works B-quality
well L-quality
. O

I O
already O
had O
one O
of O
these O
as O
my O
grown O
children O
recommended O
this O
great U-quality
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
I O
just O
bought O
two O
more O
to O
have O
in O
our O
condo O
for O
vacation O
rentals O
. O
  O
It O
is O
so O
nice U-quality
to O
stay O
in O
a O
place O
that O
has O
a O
decent O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
This O
is O
the O
one O
! O

excelent U-quality

Awesome U-quality
use O
everyday O
! O
! O
! O

This O
is O
best U-quality
valve O
for O
the O
lowest O
wattage U-power
. O
I O
like O
that O
it O
has O
a O
cool O
switch U-attachment
so O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
hold O
down O
the O
cool O
button O
when O
I O
do O
n't O
need O
heat O
to O
dry O
off O
. O
It O
looks O
good O
and O
works O
as O
you O
would O
expect O
with O
very O
simple O
toggle O
switches O

Terrific U-quality
, O
inexpensive U-price

  O
As O
good O
as O
dryers O
costing O
2 O
, O
3 O
, O
4 O
even O
5 O
times O
this O
one O
. O
  O
Gets O
hot O
quickly O
, O
stays O
hot O
, O
works O
well O
, O
light O
weight O
, O
easy O
to O
maneuver O
. O
  O
better O
for O
travel O
than O
most O
dryers O
designed O
specifically O
for O
travel O
. O
  O
We O
love O
it O
! O

The O
dryer O
is O
really O
good U-quality
but O
came O
with O
a O
missing O
part O
( O
diffuser O
) O
but O
as O
it O
is O
not O
really O
needed O
, O
am O
not O
bothered O
by O
it O
. O
Arrived O
early O
and O
well O
packaged O
. O
Would O
recommend U-quality
it O
. O
Very O
easy B-usability
to L-usability
use O
. O

Love U-quality
this O
hairdryer O
! O
  O
Lightweight U-usability
, O
good U-quality
strong U-airflow
air B-airflow
flow L-airflow
, O
and O
a O
long O
cord U-attachment
! O

We O
have O
two O
of O
these O
dryers O
at O
home O
in O
Michigan O
and O
purchased O
two O
more O
for O
our O
new O
condo O
in O
Florida O
. O
  O
Small U-appearance
but O
plenty O
powerful U-power
. O

I O
LOVE U-quality
this O
diffuser O
. O

I O
used O
this O
for O
six O
months O
. O
  O
I O
actually O
liked U-quality
it O
during O
that O
period O
of O
time O
. O
  O
BUT O
after O
using O
it O
once O
a O
day O
during O
that O
time O
period O
, O
it O
burst O
into O
flames O
and O
practically O
exploded O
while O
I O
was O
using O
it O
. O
  O
Word O
to O
the O
wise O
- O
if O
your O
hair O
dryer O
starts O
to O
smell O
like O
garlic O
DON'T O
USE O
IT O
. O
  O
Incredibly O
dangerous O
. O

OK O
, O
so O
I O
got O
this O
based O
on O
the O
other O
reviews O
I O
saw O
. O
  O
Let O
me O
say O
that O
I O
went O
from O
a O
$ U-price
150 O
Chi O
dryer O
to O
this O
. O
  O
All O
in O
all O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
in O
about O
the O
same O
time O
( O
I O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
hair O
) O
. O
  O
In O
my O
opinion O
, O
the O
main O
difference O
between O
inexpensive O
and O
expensive O
dryers O
is O
how O
long O
they O
last O
. O
  O
I O
've O
had O
the O
expensive O
one O
for O
about O
3 O
years O
or O
more O
, O
no O
issues O
. O
  O
The O
good O
thing O
about O
this O
Revlon O
( O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
price O
) O
is O
that O
it O
is O
much O
lighter O
weight O
. O
  O
So O
, O
I O
'll O
keep O
using O
it O
until O
it O
breaks O
. O
  O
One O
other O
thing O
to O
note O
, O
the O
cool O
burst O
button O
is O
really O
easy O
to O
accidentally O
trigger O
when O
you O
're O
drying O
your O
hair O
. O
Not O
a O
big O
deal O
other O
than O
it O
annoys O
me O
when O
I O
'm O
trying O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
and O
the O
cold O
air O
starts O
flowing O
and O
I O
have O
to O
adjust O
. O

Very O
good U-quality
dryer O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
for O
my O
wife O
after O
her O
old O
one O
broke O
. O
My O
wife O
seemed O
to O
think O
that O
price U-price
and O
quality O
were O
correlated O
with O
hair O
dryers O
, O
but O
after O
seeing O
the O
price O
of O
some O
of O
the O
high O
end O
hair O
dryers O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
do O
a O
bit O
more O
research O
. O
  O
I O
bought O
this O
one O
because O
it O
it O
highly O
rated O
and O
reasonably O
priced O
. O
  O
I O
'm O
happy U-quality
to O
say O
that O
my O
wife O
enjoys O
it O
and O
noticed O
no O
difference O
from O
her O
previous O
device O
which O
was O
probably O
over O
$ O
100 O
. O

Never O
thought O
the O
blow O
dryer O
made O
a O
big O
difference O
.... O
always O
thought O
it O
was O
the O
styling O
products O
... O
guess O
again O
, O
this O
will O
be O
the O
only O
blow O
dryer O
i O
will O
ever O
use O
or O
buy O
again O
.... O
awesome U-quality
for O
curly O
hair O
. O

My O
wife O
just O
loves U-quality
it O
heat U-temperature
, O
power U-power
and O
abilities O
. O
  O
She O
saw O
it O
on O
board O
a O
cruise O
ship O
and O
simply O
loved O
it O
and O
purchased O
it O
right O
after O
we O
got O
back O
home O
. O

Heavy U-usability
, O
my O
expectation O
was O
much O
too O
high O
. O
The O
$ U-price
cost U-price
was O
high O
too O
. O

great U-quality
hair O
dryer O
, O
  O
love U-quality
the O
controls O
on O
this O
. O

Exactly O
what O
I O
wanted O
at O
a O
very O
good O
price U-price

works O

I O
bought O
this O
item O
from O
2012 O
and O
it O
is O
still O
going B-quality
strong L-quality
. O
It O
is O
well B-quality
worth L-quality
the O
money U-price
. O
The O
only O
downside O
to O
it O
is O
that O
just O
before O
the O
timer O
goes O
off O
, O
you O
got O
ta O
get O
up O
from O
underneath O
it O
because O
it O
has O
a O
loud O
sound O
when O
the O
time O
runs O
out O
. O

I O
am O
so O
glad U-quality
I O
got O
this O
little O
hair O
dryer O
. O
I O
have O
thick O
, O
wavy O
hair O
and O
I O
need O
a O
powerful U-power
hair O
dryer O
to O
dry O
it O
. O
This O
is O
very O
powerful O
, O
more O
so O
than O
my O
at O
home O
hair O
dryer O
. O
I O
love O
the O
retractable O
cord O
. O
Easy O
for O
traveling O
. O
I O
weighed O
it O
on O
my O
kitchen O
scale O
and O
it O
weighs O
just O
slightly O
over O
1 O
1/4 O
pounds O
. O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
weigh O
more O
. O
A O
good O
purchase O
. O

Works B-quality
great L-quality
, O
heat U-temperature
settings U-attachment
are O
good O
, O
but O
it O
is O
very O
heavy O
and O
it O
's O
so O
long O
. O
  O
I O
had O
to O
stretch O
my O
arm O
way O
out O
so O
the O
heat O
was O
n't O
too O
close O
to O
my O
hair O
. O
  O
Definitely O
not O
for O
travel O
since O
it O
is O
so O
big O
. O
  O
But O
it O
did O
dry O
my O
hair O
. O

This O
hair O
dryer O
works B-quality
extremely I-quality
well L-quality
and O
is O
easy B-usability
to I-usability
handle L-usability
. O
  O
The O
price U-price
is O
very O
reasobable O
. O

I O
have O
been O
using O
this O
Remington O
hair O
dryer O
for O
several O
years O
now O
. O
I O
think O
the O
one O
I O
am O
currently O
using O
is O
my O
3rd O
, O
and O
this O
recent O
purchase O
is O
my O
backup O
for O
when O
the O
current O
one O
runs O
its O
course O
. O
  O
I O
am O
particular O
in O
wanting O
a O
hair O
dryer O
with O
oomph O
. O
I O
like U-quality
hairdryers O
with O
big O
bursts O
of O
hair O
- O
basically O
that O
are O
loud O
and O
fast O
. O
  O
I O
grow O
impatient O
with O
many O
other O
models O
. O
  O
This O
one O
fits O
the O
bill O
just O
right O
. O
  O
I O
also O
like O
the O
look O
and O
feel O
. O

For O
the O
international U-scenario
traveler U-scenario
, O
this O
is O
a O
must O
. O
  O
Works O
there O
and O
at O
home U-scenario
as O
well O
. O

This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
defective U-quality
and O
dangerous U-quality
. O
The O
hair O
dryer O
did O
not O
work O
on O
the O
low O
setting O
, O
the O
fan O
did O
not O
spin O
. O
I O
turned O
it O
on O
for O
only O
30 O
seconds O
and O
it O
quickly O
overheated O
and O
turned O
bright O
orange O
inside O
and O
could O
potentially O
have O
caught O
on O
fire O
. O
The O
construction O
of O
this O
hair O
dryer O
is O
very O
cheap O
and O
even O
if O
the O
one O
I O
received O
was O
just O
a O
defect O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
would O
last O
very O
long O
if O
it O
did O
work O
at O
all O
. O

Great U-quality
price U-price
and O
coality O
! O
Thank O
you O
Amazon O
! O

Love U-quality
it O

But O
I O
forgot O
to O
change O
the O
voltage O
switch U-attachment
. O
  O
So O
sad O
. O

Hair O
dryer O
was O
fair O
, O
attachment U-attachment
falls O
off O
when O
drying O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great U-quality
hair O
dryer O
but O
it O
pulled O
so O
much O
amps O
that O
i O
ca O
n't O
you O
use O
it O
oin O
my O
bathroom O
off O
of O
my O
15amp O
GFI O
outlet O

I O
love U-quality
this O
hair O
dryer O
! O
My O
hair O
is O
soft O
and O
shine O
and O
the O
high O
heat O
is O
not O
so O
hot O
that O
it O
damages O
my O
fine O
hair O
. O
The O
only O
reason O
I O
did O
not O
give O
it O
a O
5 O
star O
is O
because O
the O
cord O
is O
really O
short O
. O

Small O
but O
powerful U-power
. O
  O
Easy O
install O
and O
arrived O
on O
time O
. O

This O
baby O
is O
powerful U-power
. O
Several O
folks O
have O
complimented O
me O
on O
getting O
my O
hair O
fixed O
, O
but O
I O
did O
it O
myself O
with O
this O
dryer O
recommended O
by O
my O
hair O
stylist O
. O
The O
only O
drawback O
for O
me O
is O
it O
heavy O
, O
but O
I O
am O
getting O
used O
to O
it O
. O
Unless O
it O
breaks O
soon O
, O
it O
's O
worth O
the O
money O
. O
My O
hair O
dried O
before O
getting O
the O
frizzies O
. O

I O
've O
had O
this O
dryer O
for O
a O
little O
less O
than O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
and O
it O
just O
burnt O
out O
and O
stopped O
working O
a O
week O
ago O
. O
  O
I O
was O
drying O
my O
hair O
and O
heard O
the O
dryer O
suddenly O
get O
quieter U-noisy
. O
Then O
I O
smelled O
burning O
... O
And O
it O
just O
died O
. O
I O
'm O
a O
little O
disappointed O
with O
this O
as O
I O
had O
an O
older O
model O
that O
thankfully O
, O
I O
kept O
as O
a O
spare O
for O
travel O
. O
The O
older O
model O
of O
this O
dryer O
is O
still O
working O
10 O
years O
later O
, O
sans O
a O
missing O
temp O
button O
that O
fell O
off O
just O
before O
I O
purchased O
this O
newer O
one O
. O

This O
professional O
hair O
dryer O
came O
packaged O
beautifully O
making O
it O
perfect O
for O
giving O
as O
a O
gift O
for O
anyone O
who O
loves O
to O
do O
their O
hair O
. O
I O
'm O
obsessed O
with O
any O
hair O
product O
so O
I O
was O
so O
excited O
to O
get O
this O
product O
in O
the O
mail O
. O
I O
could O
n't O
wait O
to O
try O
it O
out O
! O
It O
is O
such O
a O
beautiful O
shade O
of O
blue O
. O
This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
1500 O
watts O
which O
means O
it O
can O
dry O
your O
hair O
super O
quick O
. O
I O
have O
very O
thick O
and O
long O
hair O
. O
My O
hair O
comes O
down O
to O
my O
lower O
back O
. O
I O
was O
able O
to O
blow O
dry O
my O
hair O
with O
this O
dryer O
in O
about O
15 O
minutes O
. O
That O
's O
a O
pretty O
good O
time O
for O
my O
hair O
. O
It O
typically O
takes O
20 O
to O
25 O
minutes O
to O
blow O
dry O
my O
hair O
. O
I O
like O
that O
this O
dryer O
has O
the O
cool O
shot O
button O
. O
I O
always O
use O
this O
button U-attachment
when O
I O
'm O
done O
to O
give O
my O
hair O
a O
cool O
down O
and O
to O
lock O
in O
my O
hairstyle O
. O
The O
dryer O
also O
comes O
with O
a O
button O
for O
3 O
speeds O
and O
3 O
heat O
settings O
. O
Another O
feature O
that O
comes O
in O
handy O
is O
the O
concentrator O
nozzle O
. O
Occasionally O
I O
like O
to O
blow O
out O
my O
hair O
and O
this O
attachment O
is O
a O
must O
to O
be O
able O
to O
achieve O
this O
style O
. O
Overall O
, O
I O
'm O
really O
pleased O
with O
this O
hair O
dryer O
and O
would O
recommend O
this O
hair O
dryer O
to O
any O
of O
my O
friends O
or O
family O
. O

Excellent O
purchase O
. O
If O
your O
hairs O
are O
wet O
and O
messy O
, O
the O
dryer O
makes O
them O
quick O
and O
easy B-usability
to I-usability
manage L-usability
. O

I O
love O
the O
heat O
- O
It O
's O
more O
warm O
than O
hot O
like O
most O
blow O
dryers O
. O
I O
feel O
like O
it O
's O
better O
for O
my O
hair O
. O
Very O
light U-usability
compared O
to O
my O
former O
blow O
dryer O
. O

I O
love O
this O
dryer O
. O
  O
It O
heats O
like O
a O
professional O
dryer O
. O
  O
The O
only O
con O
is O
that O
the O
wheels O
do O
n't O
roll O
that O
well O
and O
you O
have O
to O
hold O
the O
bonnet U-attachment
when O
moving O
it O
to O
prevent O
it O
from O
toping O
over O
. O

Great U-quality

This O
is O
a O
decent O
hairdryer O
, O
but O
a O
bit O
cumbersome O
to O
use O
- O
it O
's O
larger U-appearance
than O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
. O
Like O
really O
large U-appearance
. O
I O
recently O
purchased O
hot O
- O
boxed O
hair O
extensions O
, O
and O
bought O
this O
to O
make O
my O
life O
a O
bit O
easier O
( O
as O
I O
ca O
n't O
blow O
- O
dry O
upside O
- O
down O
) O
, O
after O
a O
recommendation O
by O
my O
hair O
stylist O
. O
It O
works O
super O
well O
at O
the O
top O
of O
my O
hair O
( O
it O
looks O
amazing O
) O
, O
but O
it O
's O
very O
difficult O
to O
maneuver O
around O
the O
head O
, O
especially O
the O
back O
, O
due O
to O
the O
weight O
, O
the O
size O
, O
and O
the O
brush O
. O
Make O
sure O
you O
give O
yourself O
enough O
time O
to O
dry O
your O
hair O
, O
as O
it O
will O
take O
a O
while O
trying O
to O
use O
this O
. O

Stopped O
working O
and O
almost O
burned O
my O
hair O
from O
sparking O
at O
the O
base O
of O
the O
cord U-attachment
. O
AFTER O

the O

very O
long O

great L-quality

I O

it O
every O
day O
for O
a O
year O
and O
have O
had O
no O
problems O
with O
it O
. O
It O
looks O
nice O
too O
! O
There O
are O
sparkles O
in O
the O
black O
section O
of O
the O
blow O
dryer O
which O
is O
always O
fun O
:) O
There O
is O
also O
a O
vent O
in O
the O
back O
that O
opens O
to O
clean O
out O
the O
dust O
or O
hair O
that O
gets O
sucked O
in O
. O
For O
the O
money O
it O
's O
definitely O
worth O
it O
. O

I O
've O
had O
this O
hair O
dryer O
for O
about O
three O
months O
and O
am O
overall O
really O
pleased U-quality
. O
My O
previous O
hair O
dryer O
was O
about O
five O
years O
old O
and O
kicked O
the O
bucket O
. O
This O
one O
is O
much O
better O
than O
that O
one O
, O
though O
like O
I O
said O
, O
it O
was O
a O
little O
older O
. O
It O
dries O
my O
hair O
in O
about O
half O
the O
time O
and O
I O
use O
both O
of O
the O
diffusers O
that O
came O
with O
if O
often O
. O
My O
reason O
for O
giving O
four O
starts O
over O
five O
is O
that O
the O
placement O
of O
the O
buttons O
for O
speed O
and O
heat O
are O
RIGHT O
where O
I O
want O
to O
put O
my O
hand O
while O
using O
it O
. O
They O
are O
pretty O
big O
, O
so O
if O
I O
keep O
my O
hands O
there O
I O
often O
hit O
them O
. O
Readusting O
my O
hand O
solves O
this O
problem O
but O
since O
it O
makes O
it O
a O
slightly O
less O
comfortable O
experience O
, O
I O
think O
four O
stars O
is O
appropriate O
. O
I O
have O
not O
( O
yet O
) O
had O
the O
issue O
of O
the O
outside O
wearing O
off O
, O
mine O
still O
looks O
new O
. O

What O
more O
can O
you O
say O
about O
a O
hairdryer O
? O
It O
's O
hot U-temperature
when O
you O
set O
it O
on O
' O
High O
' O
, O
and O
cools O
quickly O
when O
you O
hold O
the O
blue O
button O
. O
It O
always O
turns O
on O
when O
you O
need O
it O
to O
. O
That O
's O
about O
all O
I O
need O
for O
a O
hair O
dryer O
, O
and O
this O
does O
it O
. O

It O
's O
hot U-temperature
but O
not O
burn O
your O
hair O
hot O
, O
and O
powerful U-power
. O
  O
It O
's O
definitely O
worth O
buying O

I O
agree O
with O
all O
the O
criticisms O
of O
this O
dryer O
plus O
one O
more O
. O
Adjustable O
? O
Huh O
? O
You O
can O
adjust O
your O
height O
under O
it O
but O
no O
instructions O
and O
no O
intuitive O
way O
to O
adjust O
the O
hight O
of O
the O
dryer O
. O
I O
have O
the O
more O
expensive U-price
Conair O
model O
as O
well O
and O
made O
the O
mistake O
of O
buying O
this O
one O
to O
keep O
at O
my O
kids O
' O
house O
for O
when O
I O
visit O
. O

My O
first O
Yellow O
Bird O
lasted O
over O
7 O
years O
and O
plenty O
of O
use O
by O
myself O
and O
friends O
. O
The B-quality
best L-quality
dryer O
ever O
. O
This O
new O
one O
works O
just O
as O
well O
, O
though O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
I O
'll O
loan O
this O
one O
out O
so O
it O
might O
last O
longer O
. O

Good B-quality
quality L-quality
and O
right B-price
price L-price
. O

Nice U-quality
and O
powerful U-power
, O
strong U-airflow

STOPPED B-quality
WORKING L-quality
AFTER O
ONLY O
7 O
MONTHS O
:( O

The O
motor U-attachment
blew B-quality
out L-quality
after O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O

I O
returned O
mine O
. O
I O
got O
it O
to O
take O
with O
me O
to O
the O
gym O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
after O
a O
sweaty O
workout O
and O
it O
was O
not O
powerful O
enough O
for O
my O
thick O
hair O
. O
I O
get O
it O
, O
its O
a O
travel U-scenario
size O
so O
it O
wo O
nt O
be O
as O
powerful O
as O
the O
regular O
one O
but O
still O
, O
it O
was O
useless O
for O
me O
. O

So O
far O
, O
a O
very B-quality
nice L-quality
dryer O
for O
the O
price U-price
. O

I O
've O
bought O
this O
hair O
dryer O
for O
international O
travel O
. O
  O
It O
is O
very O
small U-appearance
, O
cute U-appearance
and O
light U-usability
as O
shown O
in O
the O
picture O
. O
  O
However O
, O
it O
has O
one O
big O
problem O
which O
is O
that O
it O
overheats O
and O
completely O
stops O
working O
after O
a O
few O
minutes O
which O
makes O
it O
useless O
.... O
I O
guess O
it O
overheats O
but O
I O
can O
only O
partially O
dry O
my O
hair O
which O
is O
not O
why O
I O
bought O
it O
. O

Love U-quality
it O
! O

Cord U-attachment
is O
TOO O
stiff O
. O
  O
I O
would O
have O
expected O
the O
cord O
to O
be O
supple O
. O
  O
Alas O
, O
the O
cord O
behaves O
as O
if O
it O
's O
frozen O
even O
at O
a O
temperature O
of O
84 O
degrees O
F. O

Very O
noisy U-noisy
! O
! O
! O
Not O
comfortable O
to O
sit O
under O
. O
Was O
trying O
to O
replace O
one O
the O
was O
30 O
to O
40 O
years O
old O
. O
We O
all O
know O
they O
do O
nt O
make O
things O
like O
they O
use O
to O
. O

My O
mother O
uses B-quality
ever I-quality
day L-quality

If O
I O
could O
give O
this O
product O
a O
negative O
I O
would O
. O
  O
Bought O
my O
first O
one O
with O
a O
gift O
card O
and O
loved O
at O
it O
at O
first O
, O
it O
great O
power U-power
and O
heat U-temperature
. O
  O
It O
lasted O
about O
6 O
months O
before O
it O
started O
cutting O
out O
. O
I O
contacted O
the O
seller O
, O
but O
I O
was O
beyond O
what O
they O
would O
cover O
. O
  O
Then O
I O
contacted O
the O
distributor O
who O
said O
no O
problem O
, O
send O
back O
the O
defective O
product O
and O
we O
will O
replace O
it O
. O
  O
Neat O
, O
sent O
it O
back O
at O
my O
cost O
:( O
. O
  O
Receive O
the O
replacement O
pretty O
quickly O
, O
yay O
! O
  O
Sadly O
about O
6 O
months O
later O
I O
had O
the O
same O
issue O
with O
the O
new O
one O
cutting O
out O
, O
no O
power O
. O
  O
Not O
sure O
it O
is O
worth O
contacting O
the O
distributor O
again O
so O
I O
can O
pay O
to O
send O
it O
back O
for O
a O
new O
replacement O
that O
might O
last O
another O
6 O
month O
. O
DONE O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
hooded O
dryer O
because O
I O
do O
roller O
sets O
& O
deep O
conditioning O
treatments O
weekly O
. O
  O
At O
at O
first O
, O
I O
was O
really O
happy U-quality
with O
my O
purchase O
; O
the O
dryer O
is O
quiet U-noisy
, O
and O
dries O
my O
hair O
quickly O
. O
  O
However O
, O
less O
than O
6 O
months O
later O
, O
the O
Timer O
Knob O
breaks O
! O
  O
I O
tried O
super O
glue O
, O
to O
mend O
the O
knob O
, O
but O
that O
did O
n't O
work O
so O
this O
dryer O
is O
USELESS O
now O
. O
  O
I O
can O
not O
set O
the O
time O
/ O
turn O
it O
on O
, O
without O
that O
knob O
so O
I O
ca O
n't O
use O
the O
dryer O
. O
  O
I O
'm O
extremely O
disappointed O
in O
the O
quality O
item O
and O
I O
basically O
feel O
like O
I O
threw O
$ O
100 O
+ O
in O
the O
trash O
. O
I O
ca O
n't O
remember O
if O
this O
dryer O
came O
with O
a O
warranty O
, O
but O
if O
I O
could O
give O
the O
Timer O
knob O
replaced O
I O
would O
rate O
this O
product O
higher O
; O
for O
now O
it O
's O
non O
- O
functional O
. O

Unlike O
another O
Conair O
I O
bought O
from O
Amazon O
years O
ago O
, O
this O
one O
has O
a O
cheap U-price
plastic O
smell O
that O
makes O
you O
worried O
that O
you O
might O
be O
touching O
something O
toxic O
. O
To O
add O
insult O
to O
injury O
, O
the O
purple O
plastic O
of O
the O
iron O
is O
not O
the O
slick O
metallic O
looking O
plastic O
from O
the O
packaging O
, O
but O
rather O
a O
gaudy O

good B-quality
quality L-quality

Good U-quality
but O
can O
not O
use O
in O
some O
Asian O

the O

difference O
. O

The O
bristles O
on O
the O
brush U-attachment
attachment U-attachment
are O
too O
soft O
to O
pull O
my O

strongly O
enough O
so O
that O
it O
straightens O
nicely O
. O
Also O
, O
the O
drier O
ca O
n't O
handle O
the O

It O
sits O
easily O
in O
the O

It O
has O
two O

is O
nice O

It O
great O
not O
to O
have O
to O
dig O
the O

out O

  O
it O

really O
wanted O
more O

it O
turns O

Not O
very O

I O
gave O
it O
to O
my O
husband O
who O
does O
n't O
have O
much O
hair O
. O

It O
was O
much O
larger U-appearance

I O
expected O

I O
would O
recommend O

everyone O

Its O
a O

My O
hair O
looks O

feels O
like O
I O
just O
left O
the O
salon O
every O
time O
. O

I O
thought O
this O
would O
be O
easier B-usability
to L-usability
use O
than O
a O
conventional O
hair O
dryer O
that O
blows O
my O
hair O
around O
a O
bit O
too O
much O
. O
  O
My O
mother O
had O
a O
similar O
- O
looking O
hair O
dryer O
MANY O
years O
ago O
and O
I O
thought O
this O
would O
work O
just O
as O
well O
for O
quick O
styling O
, O
avoiding O
the O
need O
to O
blow O
dry O
using O
a O
brush O
. O
  O
I O
was O
wrong O

  O
This O
is O
very O
hard B-usability

, O
hard B-usability

to O
style O
your O

( O
well O

my O
hair O
) O
and O
worse O
, O
the O
motor O
sounds O
sick O

  O
It O
makes O
a O
kind O
of O
lame O
vroom O

vroom O
sound O

it O

I O
think O
it O

do O
not O
cost O
much O

some O
can O
be O
very O
expensive O
. O
Why O
pay O
more O
? O

I O
was O
really O
excited O
about O
this O
hairdryer O
and O
it O
's O
retractable O
cord O
, O
but O
it O
really O
has O
n't O
lived O
up O
to O
the O
original O
excitement O
. O
As O
a O
hairdryer O
, O
it O
's O
just O
okay O
. O
It O
's O
no B-quality
better L-quality
than O
the O
one O
I O
used O
before O
, O
but O
it O
does O
, O
of O
course O
, O
serve O
its O
purpose O
. O
Although O
the O
cord U-attachment
does O
retract O
, O
sometimes O
it O
does O
n't O
retract O
all O
the O
way O
. O
Overall O
, O
it O
's O
not O
a O
bad O
dryer O
. O
I O
was O
just O
hoping O

This O

only O
lasted O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
before O
it O
died O
on O
me O
. O
Pretty O
disappointed U-quality
it O
did O
n't O
last O
very O
long O
because O
it O
was O
a O
great U-quality
blow O

when O
it O
worked O

Good U-quality

Good B-quality

and O
delivery O
was O
performed O
as O
expected O

broke U-quality
very O
quickly O

a O
little O
big U-appearance
for O
me O
. O
Hard B-usability
to I-usability
carry L-usability
with O
travel U-scenario

I O
purchased O
this O
at O
the O
local O
CVS O
. O
It O
's O
supposed O
to O
make O
your O
hair O
soft O
. O
It O
burned O
my O
hair O
and O
made O
the O
ends O
knotted O
and O
frizzy O
. O
Someone O
else O
on O
here O
said O
that O
it O
knotted O
their O
hair O
, O
too O
. O
I O
'm O
so O
surprised O
at O
all O
the O
positive O
reviews O
. O
The O
button O
placements O
are O
terribly O
designed O
. O
It O
's O
heavy U-usability
. O
The O
air O
on O
low O
is O
not O
low O
. O
And O
the O
low O
heat O
is O
too O
hot O
. O
Now O
I O
have O
to O
get O
a O
trim O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
frizzy O
ends O
! O
Very O
frustrating O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great U-quality
portable U-usability
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
My O
hair O
is O
fine O
and O
can O
dry O
out O
from O
some O
dryers O
, O
but O
this O
one O
is O
really O
a O
good O
product O
. O
  O
I O
love O
the O
combination O
of O
ionic O
and O
ceramic O
technology O
, O
which O
I O
really O
need O
for O
my O
hair O
. O
  O
I O
can O
keep O
the O
frizzies O
out O
, O
and O
my O
hair O
dries O
quickly O
without O
drying O
out O
. O
  O
Blow O
drying O
is O
so O
much O
easier O
. O
  O
I O
am O
really O
picky O
about O
blow O
dryers O
and O
my O
hair O
, O
so O
I O
am O
not O
being O
frivolous O
here O
. O
  O
This O
dryer O
is O
a O
keeper O
! O
So O
convenient O
for O
travel O
! O

This O
is O
a O
very O
reliable U-quality
hair O
dryer O
and O
perfect U-quality
for O
me O
by O
being O
wall O
mounted O
. O
Much O
easier O
to O
use O
when O
you O
have O
hand O
problems O
and O
strength O
limits O
. O

It O
works B-quality
fine L-quality
till O
now O
. O
the O
only O
reason O
i O
give O
only O
4 O
stars O
because O
the O
light O
that O
is O
a O
bit O
annoying O
. O
there O
is O
no O
option O
to O
turn O
it O
off O
when O
not O
in O
need O
. O

Awesome U-quality
dryer O
! O
It O
's O
fast O
and O
efficient O
with O
less O
noise O
than O
my O
old O
Conair O
dryer O
! O
Fast O
shipping O
was O
a O
plus O
! O

Not B-quality
adjustable L-quality
. O
My O
neck O
hurts O
. O

This O
is O
an O
excellent U-quality
hair O
dryer O
and O
really O
feels O
like O
it O
will O
last O
a O
long O
time O
. O
  O
Very O
high O
quality O
and O
well O
worth O
the O
money O
. O
  O
Only O
gripe O
is O
the O
toggle O
switches O
are O
a O
tiny O
bit O
too O
short O
/ O
small O
for O
me O
to O
hit O
with O
one O
handed O
operation O
but O
that O
s O
just O
me O
. O
This O
is O
a O
must O
buy O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
market O
for O
a O
decent O
hair O
dryer O
that O
is O
n't O
too O
expensive O
. O
MM O

Does B-quality
well L-quality
so O
far O
on O
high O
speed O
but O
has O
overheated O
and O
shut O
off O
twice O
on O
low O
speed O
. O
Mounting O
was O
easy O
as O
reviews O
have O
stated O
and O
it O
is O
very O
strong O
on O
high O
but O
it O
probably O
should O
be O
a O
single O
speed O
. O
The O
night O
light O
is O
nice O
to O
have O
in O
the O
bathroom O
. O
Overall O
I O
'm O
happy O
with O
it O
but O
you O
may O
be O
disappointed O
if O
the O
low O
speed O
is O
important O
to O
you O
. O

Purchased O
another O
one O
of O
these O
hair O
dryers O
as O
the O
older O
one O
was O
dying O
. O
  O
So O
far O
so B-quality
good L-quality
but O
the O
life O
of O
these O
things O
seems O
to O
be O
around O
12 O
months O
. O

Can O
not O
enough O
about O
. O
Thought O
it O
was O
all O
BS O
about O
the O
ionic O
, O
tourmaline O
and O
ceramic O
features O
really O
having O
that O
much O
of O
an O
effect O
. O
OMG O
it O
is O
so O
true O
. O
I O
only O
tried O
this O
blow O
dryer O
because O
I O
was O
n't O
gon O
na O
spend O
good O
money O
on O
some O
features O
that O
probably O
are O
false O
. O
Even O
me O
going O
cheap U-price
worked O
. O
Do O
not O
waste O
your O
money O
on O
more O
powerful O
expensive O
brands O
. O
This O
will O
get O
the O
job O
done O
. O
You O
should O
never O
use O
above O
1800W O
anyhow O
. O
Do O
n't O
forget O
to O
use O
cool O
burst O
all O
over O
head O
after O
drying O
as O
well O
. O
MIRACLE O
worker O
. O
My O
hair O
usually O
takes O
40 O
minutes O
plus O
With O
no O
brushing O
, O
which O
makes O
it O
take O
way O
longer O
. O
My O
previous O
dryer O
had O
way O
more O
W O
and O
blew O
harder O
. O
This O
dryer O
takes O
my O
hair O
10 O
- O
15 O
minutes O
( O
maybe O
) O
with O
brushing O
it O
out O
. O
My O
hair O
is O
soft O
and O
semi O
sleek O
. O
My O
hair O
is O
extra O
coarse O
, O
dry O
, O
frizzy O
and O
THICK O
. O
This O
dryer O
made O
my O
hair O
wonderful O
. O
I O
was O
able O
to O
do O
things O
to O
my O
hair O
that O
I O
never O
have O
before O
because O
of O
it O
. O
So O

This O

I O
've O
owned O
in O
a O
long O
time O
. O

This O
blow O
dryer O
is O
great U-quality
. O
I O
had O
a O
Remington O
I O
bought O
about O
6 O
years O
ago O
and O
it O
finally O
died O
a O
couple O
weeks O
ago O
. O
I O
wanted O
a O
replacement O
that O
was O
low O
energy O
but O
just O
as O
good O
at O
drying O
. O
This O
thing O
is O
even O
better O
than O
the O
last O
Remington O
I O
had O
. O
Blows O
faster O
, O
dries O
quicker O
, O
uses O
less O
electricity O
, O
and O
is O
WAY O
lighter O
and O
smaller O
. O
Very O
impressed O
. O

I O
am O
very O
satisfied U-quality
with O
the O
product O
, O
arrived O
in O
very O
good O
time O
, O
very O
well O
protected O
.. O
and O
in O
terms O
of O
quality O
, O
I O
think O
is O
very O
good O
... O
thank O
you O
very O
much O
and O
I O
hope O
that O
more O
people O
buy O
it O
... O
it O
really O
is O
very O
good O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
was O
tricked O
into O
leaving O
a O
good B-quality
review L-quality
so O
that O
I O
would O
qualify O
for O
a O
replacement O
if O
the O
hair O
dryer O
broke O
within O
2 O
years O
. O
  O
Now O
that O
I O
've O
had O
a O
while O
to O
use O
it O
, O
I O
found O
out O
it O
's O
JUNK U-quality
, O
COUNTERFEIT O
, O
BOGUS O
, O
FAKE U-quality
, O
GARBAGE U-quality
, O
etc O
. O
  O
It O
is O
definitely O
not O
a O
genuine O
T3 O
hair O
dryer O
! O
  O
I O
pulled O
out O
my O
original O
T3 O
which O
makes O
a O
funny O
noise O
now O
, O
but O
it O
drys O
my O
hair O
in O
1/2 O
the O
time O
that O
this O
new O
phony O
one O
does O
. O
  O
My O
daughter O
also O
has O
a O
authentic O
T3 O

my O

  O
She O
immediately O
knew O
something O
was O
wrong O
with O
it O

in O
fact O
got O
really O
angry O
because O
it O
dryed O
her O
hair O
so O
slowly O
she O
was O
late O
going O
out O
that O

  O
Amazon O

still O
running B-quality

for O
the O

I O

it O

a O
great O
dryer O

I O
have O
thick O

coarse O

wavy O

During O
the O
time O
I O
've O
owned O
this O

I O
've O
had O
hairstyles O
shorter O

my O

all O

The O

between O
hot O
, O
warm O
, O
cold O
, O
and O
high O

low O

made O
it O
versatile O
through O
all O
my O

It O
's O
one O
of O
the O
fastest O

I O
've O
used O

on O
high O

the O

has O
a O
strong O

fast O

On O
hot O

it O
gets O
truly O
hot O

  O
( O
But O
I O
've O
never O
had O
to O
worry O

The O
cold O

is O
cold O

  O
My O
only O
dissatisfaction O
is O
with O
the O
claim O
that O
it O
's O
an O
ionic O
hairdryer O
. O
They O
must O
have O
put O
a O
tiny O
amount O
of O
ceramic O
or O
tourmaline O
into O
the O
unit O
to O
claim O
that O
it O
's O
ionic O
-- O
it O
does O
not O
affect O
it O
's O
performance O
. O
  O
But O
other O
than O
that O
I O
've O
really O
appreciated O
it O
's O
reliability O

  O
For O
the O
price O
, O
it O
's O
great O

No B-power

  O
Combs O

were O
not O
right O
for O
my O
hair O
. O
  O
The O
ends O
of O
the O
combs O
were O
sharp O
and O
hurt O
my O
scalp O
. O
Unusable O
, O
should O
have O
returned O
it O
, O
but O
I O
threw O
away O
the O

Used O

the O

Easy B-usability

the O

are O
horrible O

Could O
of O
been O
done O
in O
5 O
minutes O
but O
was O
confused O
with O
the O

It O
's O
more O

just O
meeting O
both O

Someone O
can O
damage O
the O

It O

previous O

It O
's O
held O
up O

so O
I O
'm O
not O
going O

it O
altogether O
, O
but O
I O
would B-expectation

recommend U-quality
or O
buy O
it O
again O
. O

Bought O
as O
a O
travel U-scenario
dryer O
, O
but O
it O
's O
so O
light U-usability

I O
use O
it O
at O

Bonnet O
too O
tight O
, O
otherwise O
, O
excellent U-quality
. O
The O
bonnet O
has O
an O
adjustable O
elastic O
, O
but O
it O
is O
so O
tight O
that O
there O
is O
no O
way O
that O
one O
would O
adjust O
it O
even O
further O
. O
It O
hurt O
my O
forehead O
, O
because O
it O
was O
so O
tight O
. O
What O
I O
did O
was O
cut O
the O
elastic O
, O
and O
then O
just O
set O
the O
bonnet O
on O
my O
head O
loosely O

and O
it O
works O
perfectly O

not O
been O
an O

I O
woudl O
have O
given O
this O

The O

  O
I O
can O
not O
live O
without O

  O
I O
have O

I O
wish O
they O
would O
last O
longer O

Very O
quick O
delivery O
, O
product O
is O
not O
as O
good O
as O
I O
expected O
. O
Not O
very O
powerful U-power
, O
although O
it O
does O
dry O
hair O
fast O
. O
I O
figured O
the O
watts O
at O
1875 O
would O
be O
as O
strong O
as O
my O
old O
conair O
. O
Would O
n't O
purchase O
again O
:( O

This O
dryer O
is O
compact U-appearance
and O
worked O
fine O
for O
the O
first O
two O
months O
. O
After O
that O
the O
motor O
started O
going O
really O
slowly O
and O
essentially O
it O
can O
only O
be O
used O
on O
the O
High O
setting O
now O
, O
which O
barely O
goes O
as O
fast O
as O
the O
Low O
setting O
used O
to O
. O
Of O
course O
, O
Amazon O
only O
allows O
refunds O
for O
the O
first O
month O
. O
A O
waste O
of O
money O
, O
since O
I O
like O
drying O
my O
hair O
on O
High O
. O
It O
has O
n't O
completely O
died O
yet O
( O
6 O
months O
later O
) O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
not O
optimistic O
. O
Also O
, O
I O
took O
this O
to O
Europe O
, O
since O
it O
's O
adaptable O
to O
both O
125 O
and O
250 O
volts O
, O
and O
it O
was O
extremely O
difficult O
to O
change O
the O
setting O
from O
one O
to O
the O
other O
. O
When O
I O
turned O
it O
on O
in O
England O
, O
after O
changing O
the O
voltage O
indicator O
, O
it O
shorted O
out O
our O
US O
/ O
UK O
plug O
adapter O
and O
did O
n't O
work O
at O
all O
. O
So O
I O
'm O
not O
convinced O
that O
it O
actually O
does O
change O
between O
voltages O
. O

Update O
... O
The O
hair O
dryer O
slowly O
died U-quality
after O
one O
year O
of O
use O
. O
Not O
surprising O
since O
it O
only O
had O
two O
settings O
: O
kinda O
powerful O
and O
very O
powerful O
. O
It O
was O
good O
for O
quickly O
drying O
my O
hair O
, O
but O
would O
leave O
my O
hair O
frizzy O
sometimes O
and O
was O
a O
pain O
for O
styling O
. O
I O
mostly O
used O
it O
when O
traveling O
. O
I O
was O
also O
never O
happy O
with O
the O
plastic O
wall O
mount O
because O
it O
cracked O
and O
the O
hair O
dryer O
sometimes O
falls O
out O
. O

This O
was O
a O
an B-quality
ok I-quality
product L-quality
. O
Stopped O
working O
after O
about O
5 O
months O
of O
use O

I O
bought O
this O
for O
my O
girlfriend O
last O
year O
for O
Christmas O
. O
A O
little O
less O
than O
a O
year O
later O
the O
hair O
dryer O
's O
motor O
has O
malfunctioned O
. O
I O
called O
up O
the O
manufacturer O
, O
since O
it O
has O
a O
one O
year O
manufacturers O
warranty O
, O
and O
was O
told O
that O
they O
would O
replace O
it O
if O
I O
paid U-price
for O
the O
item O
to O
be O
shipped O
back O
and O
paid O
a O
$ U-price
10 O
warranty O
replacement O
fee O
. O
I O
as O
the O
consumer O
should O
not O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
warranty O
of O
a O
product O
that O
failed O
to O
even O
last O
a O
year O
. O
Other O
buyers O
, O
please O
be O
aware O

this O
companies O
horrible O

. O

I O
love U-quality
the O
folding O
handle O
, O
retractable O
cord O
and O
compact O
design O
. O
However O
, O
mine O
was O
a O
rare O
anomaly O
because O
it O
overheated O
and O
the O
opening O
started O
to O
contort O
slightly O
like O
it O
was O
melting O
. O
Had O
to O
return O
, O
but O
I O
will O
buy O
another O
one O
, O
because O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
this O
was O
the O
norm O
. O

I O
love U-quality
this O
blow O
dryer O
and O
it O
arrived O

I O

This O
is O
great U-quality
blow O
dryer O
. O
  O
Heat O

  O
I O
have O
past O
shoulder O

, O
set O
it O
on O
half O
heat O
, O
dries O
within O
7 O
minutes O
and O
not O
frizzy O
! O

It O
's O
what O
I O
would O
expect O
from O
a O
25 O
dollar U-price
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
Not O
many O
extra O
, O

Best U-quality
blow O

on O
the O
market O
from O
what O
I O
can O
tell O
. O
  O
The O
first O
one O
of O
these O
died O
on O
me O
after O
5 O
years O
of O
daily O
use O
. O
  O
I O
did O
not O
hesitate O
to O
buy O
another O
one O
. O
  O
My O
thick O
hair O
is O
lustrous O
and O
bouncy O
. O

Love U-quality
this O

works B-quality
great L-quality
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O

Product O
just O
decided O
to O
stop B-quality
working L-quality
after O
a O
few O
years O
. O
Never O
dropped O
it O
and O
kept O
it O
in O
good O
condition O
. O
I O
'm O
guessing O
maybe O
the O
thing O
overheated O
? O

Great B-quality
packaging L-quality
and O
quick O
shipping O
. O
I O
love O
that O
the O
settings O
are O
not O
too O
hot O
and O
the O
low O
speed O
is O
perfectly O
low O
, O
even O
for O
a O
toddler O
. O
The O
high O
speed O
will O
do O
when O
she O
gets O
older O
, O
I O
'm O
sure O
. O

Best U-quality
hair O
dryer O
ever O
. O

Good B-quality
value L-quality
but O
crummy O
dryer O
. O
Does O
n't O
get O
very O
hot O
but O
it O
is O
n't O
too O
noisy O
... O
it O
was O
cheap O
so O
did O
n't O
have O
super O
high O
expectations O
. O

I O
really O
wanted O
to O
like U-quality
this O
( O
especially O
when O
it O
arrived O
super O
fast O
-- O
within O
24 O
hours O
of O
ordering O
) O
. O
  O
Sadly O
, O
the O
cord U-attachment
was O
short O
, O
and O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
hold O
and O
use O
without O
accidentally O
switching O
the O
buttons O
. O
  O
It O
left O
my O
hair O
feeling O
like O
straw O
. O
  O
Time O
to O
try O
another O
! O

Love U-quality
it O

First O
the O
positive O
: O
this O
hairdryer O
is O
just O
the O
right O
weight U-usability
, O
not O
so O
heavy U-usability
that O
your O
arm O
gets O
tired O
during O
blow O
drying O
and O
not O
too O
light O
either O
. O
The O
color O
of O
the O
model O
I O
got O
is O
a O
sort O
of O
shimmering O
raspberry O
and O
is O
beautiful O
. O
The O
cord O
keeper O
feature O
is O
also O
pretty O
handy O
and O
so O
far O
, O
after O
using O
this O
dryer O
every O
day O
for O
almost O
a O
week O
works O
well O
. O
it O
gets O
moderately O
warm O
and O
has O
a O
somewhat O
ok O
power O
. O
I O
definitely O
would O
n't O
call O
it O
ultra O
powerful O
. O
I O
have O
another O
hairdryer O
at O
home O
which O
is O
a O
little O
more O
powerful O
. O
It O
dries O
my O
shoulder O
length O
hair O
, O
start O
to O
finish O
in O
around O
10 O
minutes O
. O
This O
conair O
dryer O
is O
not O
hot O
enough O
or O
powerful O
enough O
to O
do O
that O
and O
has O
taken O
almost O
20 O
minutes O
everyday O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
. O
This O
hairdryer O
is O
perfectly O
ok O
if O
you O
have O
shortish O
, O
or O
fine O
hair O
and O
are O
not O
in O
a O
rush O
. O
I O
will O
use O
it O
on O
weekends O
or O
evenings O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
get O
up O
10 O
- O
15 O
minutes O
earlier O
in O
the O
morning O
to O
get O
my O
hair O
dried O
. O

great B-quality
product L-quality

Well U-quality
, O
  O
I O
purchased O
this O
item O
just O
for O
weatherizing O
my O
windows O
and O
it O
worked O
for O
that O
. O

A O
great U-quality
hairdryer O
. O

Ca O
n't O
beat O
the O
$ O
10 O
price O
! O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
new O
hair O
dryer O
, O
and O
this O
was O
one O
of O
the O
3 O
choices O
I O
had O
. O
The O
other O
one O
was O
also O
Remington O
( O
$ O
30 O
) O
, O
and O
the O
third O
was O
from O
another O
brand O
for O
around O
$ O
60 O
. O
I O
'm O
not O
a O
fan O
of O
yellow O
color O
, O
so O
this O
was O
one O
thing O
keeping O
me O
from O
getting O
this O
hair O
dryer O
( O
when O
I O
was O
looking O
at O
it O
, O
it O
cost O
around O
$ O
20 O
) O
. O
However O
, O
next O
day O
the O
price O
went O
to O
$ O
10 O
, O
and O
I O
did O
n't O
have O
to O
think O
much O
as O
the O
specifications O
were O
exactly O
as O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
. O
After O
trying O
the O
hair O
dryer O
, O
I O
can O
only O
say O
the O
best O
things O
- O
it O
works B-quality
perfectly L-quality
! O

First O
one O
shot O
out O
sparks O
and O
died O
after O
about O
two O
years O
of O
usage O
, O
not O
a O
bad O
run O
but O
a O
frightening O
end O
.. O
I O
loved U-quality
the O
size O
so O
had O
purchased O
a O
second O
back O
up O
soon O
after O
buying O
the O
original O
. O
Put O
the O
backup O
in O
service O
about O
six O
months O
ago O
and O
the O
blower O
on O
that O
one O
started O
sounding O
odd O
recently O
, O
Today O
it O
made O
a O
loud O
noise O
and O
a O
piece O
fell O
off O
inside O
. O
I O
'm O
about O
to O
shop O
for O
another O
brand O
.. O

Bought O
this O
for O
my O

It O
does O
n't O
have O
a O
guard O
like O
my O
Conair O
does O
to O
keep O
the O
hair O
from O
being O
sucked O
in O
the O
back O
of O
it O
( O
most O
women O
know O
what O
I O
mean O
) O
but O
it O
is O
well O
worth O
the O

dryer O
that O
often O
, O
so O
I O
admit O
that O
I O
'm O
not O
the O
target O
market O
. O
But O
my O
wife O
has O
very O
thick O
long O
hair O
and O
uses O
a O
blow O
dryer O
every O
time O
she O
washes O
her O
hair O
. O
I O
've O
kept O
a O
close O
eye O
on O
her O
hair O
since O
she O
started O
using O
this O
dryer O
and O
I O
ca O
n't O
detect O
any O
difference O
either O
. O
So O
I O
asked O
her O
directly O
, O
would O
you O
pay O
$ O
130 O
for O
this O
? O
No O
, O
she O
would O
n't O
. O
She O
said O
that O
it O
's O
not O
much O
different O
than O
her O
$ O
40 O
dryer O
. O
I O
like O
the O
fact O
that O
there O
are O
two O
independent O
controls O
: O
temp O
and O
air O
speed O
. O
That O
's O
nice O
. O
I O
also O
like O
the O
fact O
that O
you O
can O
override O
the O
heat O
and O
blast O
cold O
air O
on O
demand O
. O
That O
's O
a O
great O
touch O
. O
But O
as O
far O
as O
the O
moisturizing O
and O
conditioning O
aspects O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
detect O
them O
at O
all O
. O
I O
'm O
not O
typically O
such O
a O
skeptic O
, O
but O
when O
a O
product O
costs O
substantially O
more O
than O
the O
everyday O
version O
that O
I O
've O
been O
using O
for O
years O
, O
I O
need O
to O
somehow O
be O
convinced O
and O
wowed O
that O
the O
product O
is O
really O
worth O
paying O
so O
much O
more O
. O
Unfortunately O
, O
I O
was O
n't O
wowed O
by O
this O
dryer O
. O

Although O
I O
'm O
wary O
that O
the O
dryer O
may O
go O
out O
in O
the O
next O
8 O
- O
10 O
months O
or O
start O
to O
develop O
a O
strange O
scent O
( O
per O
previous O
reviews O
here O
and O
on O
other O
sites O
) O
, O
I O
am O
for O
the O
most O
part O
happy U-quality
with O
my O
purchase O
ESPECIALLY O
for O
the O
price O
of O
$ O
20 O
for O
a O
hair O
dryer O
that O
is O
still O
being O
sold O
in O
Ulta O
and O
other O
stores O
for O
up O
to O
$ O
55 O
. O
The O
dryer O
does O
have O
side O
buttons O
, O
which O
for O
many O
people O
was O
an O
issue O
, O
but O
the O
dryer O
I O
had O
prior O
had O
the O
same O
feature O
and O
it O
does O
n't O
get O
in O
my O
way O
now O
as O
it O
did O
n't O
then O
. O
The O
hair O
dryer O
is O
light O
/ O
medium O
weight O
. O
The O
swivel O
cord O
has O
n't O
been O
an O
issue O
for O
me O
either O
. O
This O
is O
after O
1 O
use O
but O
I O
believe O
it O
is O
going O
to O
work O
out O
wonderfully.(Also O
note O
: O
make O
sure O
you O
dry O
your O
hair O
1 O
- O
2 O
inches O
away O
from O
the O
hair O
itself O
or O
else O
this O
or O
ANY O
dryer O
will O
burn O
out O
quicker O
than O
it O
normally O
would O
! O
) O

I O
was O
definitely O
skeptical O
of O
the O
claims O
of O
this O
dryer O
's O
nanoe O
technology O
. O
But O
surprisingly O
, O
my O
hair O
feels O
smoother O
and O
more O
conditioned O
than O
normal O
( O
as O
if O
I O
used O
extra O
conditioner O
or O
just O
done O
a O
treatment O
) O
. O
The O
dryer O
dries O
quickly U-dryingspeed
with O
strong O
blast O
without O
being O
too O
noisy O
. O
It O
looks O
sleek O
and O
, O
despite O
the O
size O
, O
does O
n't O
feel O
overly O
heavy O
. O
The O
weight O
is O
well O
balanced O
. O
The O
cold O
blast O
feature O
works O
as O
expected O
. O
The O
issues O
I O
had O
was O
with O
the O
sliding O
button O
controls O
which O
can O
be O
a O
little O
stiff O
. O
Also O
, O
I O
have O
straight O
, O
moderately O
thick O
hair O
and O
the O
' O
conditioning O
' O
effect O
sometimes O
flatten O
my O
hair O
. O
Hair O
can O
feel O
too O
soft O
that O
there O
's O
not O
enough O
' O
lift O
' O
and O
bounce O
. O
This O
is O
great O
when O
hair O
is O
brittle O
and O
frizzy O
. O
Not O
so O
great O
on O
humid O
days O
. O
Curly O
hair O
may O
not O
have O
this O
issue O
. O
So O
far O
, O
the O
biggest O
drawback O
is O
definitely O
the O
price O
. O

Good U-quality
for O
basic O
hair O
dying O
needs O
. O
Not O
for O
styling O
so O
much O
. O
But O
for O
the O
price U-price
I O
say O
two O
thumbs O
up O

Gets O
rid O
of O
the O
frizzies O
. O
  O
Perfect U-quality
! O

This O
hair O
dryer O
is B-quality
okay L-quality
. O
Bonnet O
is O
comfortable O
however O
the O
air O
hose O
is O
too O
short O
so O
you O
almost O
need O
to O
hold O
it O
on O
your O
lap O
when O
using O
it O
. O
Also O
hose O
and O
or O
bonnet O
do O
not O
fit O
back O
into O
side O
of O
dryer O
as O
it O
would O
appear O
. O
A O
bit O
concerned O
that O
I O
can O
only O
use O
the O
dryer O
on O
low O
setting O
because O
it O
seems O
to O
get O
too O
hot O
. O

Searched O
high O
and O
low O
for O
a O
good B-quality
quality L-quality
, O
  O
stylish O
and O
affordable O
hair O
dryer O
. O
This O
is O
perfect O
.... O
I've O
had O
it O
a O
while O
now O
( O
over O
a O
year O
) O
and O
I O
am O
still O
happy O
to O
have O
found O
this O
. O
  O
I O
really O
love O
the O
folding O
handle O
and O
retracting O
cable O
with O
the O
push O
of O
a O
button O
- O
allows O
me O
to O
pack O
it O
away O
nice O
and O
easily O
. O
  O
Everything O
else O
works O
as O
described O
. O

Had O
no O
idea O
this O
hair O
dryer O
had O
a O
retractable O
cord O
! O
! O
I O
was O
very O
excited O
to O
see O
that O
. O
Works B-quality
great L-quality
, O
but O
it O
makes O
our O
apartment O
fuse O
blow O
every O
time O
I O
use O
it O
more O
than O
10 O
- O
15 O
minutes O
( O
might O
just O
be O
our O
place O
but O
we O
live O
in O
a O
townhome O
) O
. O

I O
gave O
my O
daughter O
, O
a O
hair O
stylist O
, O
this O
Panasonic O
hair O
dryer O
to O
try O
out O
. O
  O
She O
liked O
it O
so O
much O
that O
she O
took O
it O
to O
work O
and O
replaced O
her O
other O
dryer O
with O
this O
one O
. O
  O
She O
told O
me O
that O
no O
matter O
what O
hair O
type O
she O
worked O
on O
, O
this O
hair O
dryer O
made O
the O
client O
's O
hair O
look O
fuller O
, O
and O
silky O
. O
  O
Maybe O
it O
's O
the O
nanoe O
technology O
that O
makes O
the O
difference O
. O
  O
She O
also O
liked O
the O
extra O
long O
cord O
( O
9 O
ft O
) O
. O
  O
The O
only O
negative O
thing O
was O
that O
it O
's O
a O
little O
on O
the O
heavy U-usability
side O
for O
home O
use O
, O
although O
professional O
hair O
dryers O
tend O
to O
be O
that O
way O
. O
  O
Imported O
from O
Thailand O
. O

Works B-quality
great L-quality
, O
light O
weight O
, O
easy O
to O
handle O
. O
  O
Just O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
.. O

The O
wife O
says O
to O
give O
this O
dryer O
5 O
stars O
. O
She O
really O
likes U-quality
it O
! O

My O
other O
Conair O

was O
starting O
to O
turn O
itself O
off O
( O
shorting O
out O

) O
during O
use O
so O
I O
hunted O
Amazon O

for O
a O
good O
one O
with O
Prime O

This O
one O
came O
up O
with O
the O
most O
reviews O
in O
this O
price O
range O
. O
I O
know O
I O
should O
n't O
but O
I O
wash O
and O
dry O
my O
hair O
every O
day O
. O
I O
needed O
something O
reliable O
but O
under O
$ O
30.The O
first O
thing O
that O
bothered O
me O
was O
that O
I O
received O
an O
obvious O
return O
which O
does O
n't O
bode O
well O

I O
've O
tried O
this O

a O
couple O
days O
so O
the O

's O
still O
out O
but O
right O
away O
here O

Also O

I O
first O
used O
this O

at O
a O
hotel O

It O
is O
definitely O
one O
of O
the O
best O
hairdryers O
I O
have O
ever O
owned O
. O
It O
is O
small U-appearance

compact U-appearance

folds O
nicely O

It O
also O
has O
a O
retractable O

which O
is O
a O
huge O
bonus O
. O
As O
far O
as O
drying O
goes O
, O
this O

did O
a O
great O
job O

my O

I O
have O
thick O

coarse O

The O

this O

shaved O
at O

five O
minutes O
off O
my O
normal O
drying O
time O

It O
is O
also O
surprisingly O
quiet O
( O
as O
quiet O

a O

can O
be O
) O
, O
even O
on O
the O

Great U-quality
hair O
dryer O

I O
like O
that O
it O
has O
a O
cool O
blowing O

in O
the O

time O
I O
can O
dry O
my O
hair O
without O
heat O
. O
Works O
fine O
for O
me O
. O
The O
handle O
is O
a O
little O
big O
and O
awkward O
to O
hold O
when O
I O
switch O
it O
to O
my O
left O
hand O
but O
if O
I O
hold O
it O
up O
at O
the O
top O
it O
's O
okay O
. O
The O
pros O
outweigh O
the O
cons O
for O
me O
! O

This O
is O
a O
great U-quality
hair O
dryer O
! O
I O
watched O
the O
utube O
video O
of O
the O
woman O
with O
naturally O
curly O
hair O
and O
how O
she O
used O
this O
particular O
dryer O
because O
I O
have O
permed O
hair O
and O
need O
a O
diffuser O
and O
medium O
air O
pressure O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
but O
still O
keep O
the O
curls O
. O
My O
previous O
Sassoon O
hair O
dryer O
did O
a O
great O
job O
of O
drying O
as O
well O
as O
maintaining O
my O
slowly O
diminishing O
old O
perm O
curls O
but O
with O
a O
little O
scrunching O
with O
mousse O
and O
my O
old O
, O
non O
ion O
ceramic O
dryer O
, O
my O
curls O
still O
looked O
good O
. O
With O
my O
purchase O
of O
the O
Remington O
AC2015 O
  O
pearl O
, O
ionic O
dryer O
additions O
, O
I O
looked O
forward O
to O
the O
same O
old O
but O
better O
..... O
My O
hair O
is O
much O
more O
shiny O
and O
less O
frizzy O
, O
yes O
, O
but O
I O
do O
have O
to O
work O
with O
scrunching O
/ O
spray O
to O
get O
those O
curls O
that O
I O
had O
when O
drying O
with O
my O
old O
non O
- O
pearl O
ceramic O
, O
etc O
. O
hairdryer O
. O
I O
think O
the O
ceramic O
or O
pearl O
or O
ionic O
features O
of O
this O
dryer O
are O
wonderful O
but O
, O
for O
someone O
like O
me O
with O
a O
loose O
perm O
of O
about O
10 O
months O
, O
the O
dryer O
makes O
my O
hair O
just O
too O
smooth O
. O
Am O
certain O
this O
model O
would O
be O
perfect O
for O
all O
those O
ladies O
with O
gorgeous O
, O
thick O
hair O
who O
want O
the O
smooth O
look O
at O
a O
very O
very O
good O
price O
. O
Diffuser O
is O
included O
which O
did O
entice O
me O
to O
purchase O
this O
hair O
dryer O
as O
I O
do O
need O
to O
use O
a O
diffuser O
. O
BTW O
, O
reviewers O
have O
said O
dryer O
could O
be O
lighter O
in O
weight O
but O
it O
's O
perfectly O
OK O
with O
me O
. O
I O
felt O
my O
old O
dryer O
was O
OK O
regarding O
weight O
and O
feel O
this O
one O
is O
, O
as O
well O
. O
Not O
noisy O
at O
all O
, O
despite O
what O
some O
have O
said O
. O
I O
use O
it O
on O
medium O
airflow O
and O
medium O
heat O
and O
I O
'm O
very O
happy O
- O
not O
loud O
and O
I O
could O
definitely O
use O
the O
dryer O
for O
as O
long O
as O
it O
took O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
if O
I O
had O
long O
hair O
w/o O
freaking O
out O
because O
of O
its O
noise O
. O

Best U-quality
hair O
dryer O
ever O
. O
It O
is O
very O
strong O
and O
dries O
your O

, O
it O
also O
gives O
a O
volume O
since O
it O
is O
1600 O
Watt O
, O
the O
money O
you O
pay O
for O
it O
definitely O
worth O
it O
. O

My O
last O
hair O
dryer O
was O
an O
Andis O
and O
I O
bought O
an O
Andis O
again O
because O
I O
was O
so O
impressed O
with O
their O

We O

so O
I O

were O
accurate O
and O
the O
cool O
shot O

worked O
fine O
. O
Left O
my O
hair O
looking O
full O
with O
a O
nice O
shine O
. O
It O
felt O
well O
balanced O
in O
the O

was O
easy O
to O
hold O

work O
with O

This O
is O

've O
ever O
owned O
. O
  O
My O
5 O
year O
old O

caught O
fire O
. O
After O
a O
few O
quick O
looks O
around O
my O
ruraltown O
for O
  O
any O

  O
( O

I O
just O
went O

with O
little O
consideration O

in O
5 O
minutes O
I O
just O
clicked O
  O
the O
buy O

forgot O
about O
it O

  O
When O

I O
used O
it O
, O
it O
was O
a O
force O
! O
  O
My O
hair O
dryed O
  O
practically O
instantly O
and O
with O

  O
It O

many O

  O
Not O

all O
are O
for O

  O
Ca O

Just O
pushed O

all O
until O

  O
I O

  O
I O

why O
this O

works O
better O
in O

.... O
  O

Do O

With O
Amazon O
you O
can O

It O
works O
great O
, O
is O
a O
little O
bit O
heavy O
but O
has O
good O
power O
, O
it O
heated O
very O
well O
. O
I O
am O
happy U-quality
with O
my O
purchase O

I O
've O
had O
my O
hair O
dryer O
, O
a O
Conair O
mini O
, O
for O
ages O
-- O
more O
than O
10 O
years O
. O
  O
The O
Conair O
has O
only O
two O
setting U-attachment
( O
high O
and O
low O
) O
and O
did O
not O
come O
with O
any O
accessories O
. O
  O
So O
going O
from O
the O
Conair O
to O
the O
Panasonic O
Nanoe O
was O
like O
upgrading O
from O
a O
basic O
to O
a O
state O
- O
of O
-the O
- O
art O
hair O
dryer O
. O
The O
Panasonic O
Nanoe O
comes O
with O
a O
quick O
- O
dry O
nozzle O
, O
a O
set O
nozzle O
and O
a O
diffuser O
. O
It O
boasts O
3 O
temperatures O
settings O
-- O
hot O
, O
warm O
and O
cool O
, O
and O
a O
choice O
of O
strong O
( O
high O
) O
or O
gentle O
( O
low O
) O
airflow O
. O
  O
What O
makes O
this O
hair O
dryer O
special O
is O
that O
it O
produces O
nanoe O
or O
invisible O
water O
particles O
that O
cling O
to O
your O
hair O
as O
you O
dry O
it O
. O
I O
have O
thick O
hair O
that O
reaches O
to O
my O
shoulders O
and O
when O
I O
used O
the O
Panasonic O
, O
I O
had O
the O
impression O
that O
strands O
of O
hair O
were O
separated O
. O
It O
boosted O
my O
hair O
's O
natural O
volume O
and O
gave O
it O
more O
movement O
. O
And O
my O
hair O
felt O
softer O
too O
after O
I O
used O
the O
Panasonic O
with O
the O
quick O
- O
dry O
nozzle O
and O
the O
diffuser O
. O
  O
My O
sister O
who O
has O
long O
fine O
hair O
also O
agreed O
that O
this O
dryer O
seemed O
to O
give O
her O
hair O
more O
volume O
too O
. O
Since O
I O
've O
been O
handling O
a O
mini O
dryer O
for O
years O
, O
it O
took O
a O
bit O
of O
time O
to O
get O
used O
to O
the O
full O
- O
sized O
Panasonic O
. O
At O
first O
it O
felt O
heavy O
, O
especially O
when O
I O
attached O
the O
diffuser O
to O
it O
, O
and O
therefore O
was O
somewhat O
awkward O
to O
manage O
. O
  O
However O
, O
I O
'm O
getting O
used O
to O
its O
weight O
and O
size O
and O
therefore O
doing O
a O
better O
job O
at O
styling O
my O
hair O
with O
it O
. O
  O
The O
Panasonic O
Nanoe O
does O
emit O
a O
smell O
, O
but O
according O
to O
the O
operating O
instructions O
booklet O
, O
it O
is O
normal O
and O
harmless O
. O
I'm O
glad O
I O
got O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
I O
like O
having O
the O
different O
temperature O
settings O
, O
especially O
the O
cool O
one O
because O
I O
want O
to O
avoid O
heat O
damage O
. O
  O
With O
my O
old O
dryer O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
have O
any O
other O
choice O
but O
hot O
. O
  O
After O
using O
an O
attachment O
with O
the O
hot O
setting O
, O
it O
may O
be O
warm O
to O
the O
touch O
so O
handle O
with O
care O
if O
you O
need O
to O
switch O
nozzles O
. O
  O
This O
is O
a O
great O
hair O
dryer O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
quite O
understand O
the O
fine O
details O
behind O
the O
Nanoe O
technology O
, O
but O
these O
invisible O
particles O
certainly O
make O
my O
hair O
look O
good O
. O

luv U-quality
it O
. O

I O
have O
had O
this O
for O
about O
a O
year O
now O
and O
I O
like U-quality

This O

the O

This O

is O
just O
alright O
. O
I O
have O
fine O
wavy O
hair O
, O
but O
a O
lot O
of O
it O
, O
and O
needed O
a O
hair O
dryer O
with O
a O
diffuser O
. O
After O
looking O
through O
reviews O
I O
decided O
to O
purchase O
this O
one O
over O
some O
cheaper U-price
models O
or O
buying O
the O
same O
Vidal O
Sassoon O
model O
I O
've O
owned O
for O
many O
years O
. O
My O
first O
impression O
was O
that O
I O
was O
shocked O
by O
how O
heavy O
it O
was O
, O
because O
it O
's O
ceramic O
. O
It O
can O
be O
sort O
of O
awkward O
to O
use O
before O
you O
get O
used O
to O
it O
. O
Secondly O
, O
the O
difference O
between O
the O
warm O
to O
the O
hot O
setting O
is O
pretty O
big O
. O
The O
warm O
on O
mine O
has O
barely O
more O
heat O
than O
the O
cool O
setting O
and O
the O
hot O
setting O
is O
too O
hot O
to O
use O
for O
more O
than O
a O
minute O
or O
two O
. O
The O
hot O
also O
makes O
my O
hair O
super O
frizzy O
, O
but O
that O
's O
fixed O
by O
blasting O
it O
on O
the O
cool O
setting O
after O
the O
heat O
. O
But O
I O
do O
worry O
that O
it O
damages O
my O
hair O
. O
I O
would O
use O
the O
warm O
setting O
if O
it O
did O
n't O
take O
so O
long O
. O
This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
kept O
at O
my O
boyfriend O
's O
and O
I O
only O
use O
it O
to O
dry O
the O
roots O
of O
my O
hair O
with O
the O
diffuser O
to O
give O
them O
lift O
, O
so O
it O
does O
n't O
see O
much O
use O
. O
Because O
I O
do O
n't O
use O
it O
often O
I O
can O
get O
over O
the O
negatives O
of O
the O
dryer O
and O
it O
is O
alright O
for O
me O
. O
If O
I O
had O
to O
use O
it O
every O
day O
or O
dried O
more O
than O
the O
roots O
of O
my O
hair O
I O
would O
return O
it O
. O

This O
is O
awesome U-quality
I O
really O
love U-quality
it O
;) O

years O
. O

First O
used O

love U-quality
the O
retractable O

. O

I O
bought O
this O

my O
wife O
because O
she O
borrowed O
one O
like O
this O
while O

this O

An O
excellent U-quality

The O
retractable O

coarse O
hair O
( O
4c O
) O
, O
medium O
length O
. O
This O
dryer O
beat O
my O
old O
Conair O
dryer O
hands O
down O
- O
it O
takes O
about O
30 O
% O
less O
time O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
. O
The O
design O
is O
perfect O
- O
comb O
attachments O
slide O
in O
and O
stays O
in O
place O
during O
the O
entire O
drying O
process O
( O
my O
old O
dryer O
's O
comb O
would O
always O
pop O
off O
at O
least O
twice O
and O
I O
've O
broken O
two O
comb O
attachments O
in O

many O
months O
) O
. O
I O

like O
the O
width O
of O
this O
dryer O
. O
It O
does O
get O
very O
hot O
so O
use O
a O
high O
smoke O
point O
oil O
like O
coconut O
to O
protect O
your O
hair O
while O

The O
amount O
of O
air O
blowing O
out O
was O
just O
perfect O
, O
and O
using O
the O

enabled O
me O
to O
center O
in O

LOVE.This O

my O
unbiased O
opinion O
. O

Ok O
so O
i O
have O
thick O
coarse O
hair O
and O
i O
was O
looking O
for O
something O
that O
can O
tame O
this O
head O
of O
mine O
. O
First O
let O
me O
start O
by O
saying O
I O
do O
like O
the O
retractable O
cord U-attachment
. O
Must O
have O
now O
. O
I O
like O
that O
five O
settings O
this O
offers O
, O
( O
hot O
, O
warm O
, O
cool O
, O
low O
, O
and O
high O
) O
i O
do O
wish O
there O
was O
a O
medium O
  O
but O
its O
not O
bad O
. O
My O
only O
thing O
is O
i O
can O
not O
use O
either O
of O
the O
attachments O
and O
i O
know O
that O
because O
of O
my O
hair O
, O
however O
there O
is O
always O
at O
least O
one O
attachment O
i O
can O
use O
, O
not O
this O
time O
. O
It O
gives O
you O
recommendations O
based O
on O
your O
hair O
what O
settings O
to O
use O
. O
Overall O
its O
not O
a O
bad O
dryer O
. O
Has O
many O
nice O
features O
just O
wish O
it O
came O
with O
more O
or O
different O
or O
even O
other O
attachment O
options O
. O

My O
hairdresser O
uses O
this O
blow O
dryer O
and O
recommended U-quality
it O
to O
me O
when O
I O
told O
him O
I O
did O
not O
feel O
mine O
was O
powerful O
enough O
. O
This O
dries O
my O
hair O
in O
a O
fraction O
of O
the O
time O
as O
it O
used O
to O
take O
me O
. O
I O
love O
the O
adjustable O
settings O
for O
heat O
and O
for O
power O
, O
and O
the O
Ionic O
blast O
button O
for O
cold O
shots O
is O
great O
, O
too O
. O

Wow O
! O
  O
First O
and O
foremost O
, O
if O
you O
have O
long O
hair O
this O
is O
the O
Hair O
Dryer O
for O
you O
! O
  O
I O
have O
long O
hair O
and O
constantly O
fight O
with O
the O
air O
intake O
valve O
on O
my O
other O
hair O
dryers O
as O
they O
suck O
up O
my O
hair O
and O
it O
gets O
tangled O
up O
inside O
! O
  O
The O
Rimini O
by O
XTAVA O
  O
has O
mesh O
like O
metal O
over O
the O
air O
intake O
valve O
and O
can O
not O
suck O
my O
hair O
into O
it O
. O
Secondly O
, O
it O
is O
powerful U-power
which O
is O
probably O
why O
it O
says O
professional O
in O
the O
name O
and O
oh O
SO O
quiet O
compared O
to O
all O
the O
other O
hair O
dryers O
I O
have O
used O
. O
  O
Third O
, O
it O
is O
light O
and O
the O
handle O
makes O
it O
so O
easy O
to O
use O
and O
to O
reach O
the O
different O
control O
buttons O
while O
you O
are O
still O
drying O
. O
  O
Love O
that O
it O
has O
a O
cold O
shot O
button O
to O
help O
set O
my O
hair O
. O
  O
It O
comes O
with O
a O
control O
nozzle O
that O
fits O
very O
well O
and O
is O
easy O
to O
get O
off O
and O
on O
to O
precisely O
aim O
the O
air O
right O
where O
you O
want O
it O
. O
All O
in O
all O
I O
will O
tell O
you O
this O
is O
the O
best O
hair O
dryer O
that O
I O
have O
ever O
owned O
and O
it O
is O
aesthetically O
pretty O
too O
! O
  O
I O
wo O
n't O
get O
into O
all O
the O
specs O
because O
you O
can O
read O
them O
above O
but O
it O
does O
have O
3 O
heat O
settings O
and O
yes O
, O
I O
use O
them O
all O
during O
one O
drying O
and O
it O
has O
2 O
speed O
settings O
plus O
the O
cold O
shot O
button O
. O
  O
It O
usually O
takes O
about O
20 O
minutes O
to O
completely O
dry O
my O
hair O
and O
with O
this O
one O
it O
took O
about O
12 O
minutes O
. O
  O
I O
did O
receive O
this O
to O
try O
in O
exchange O
for O
my O
honest O
review O
and O
I O
will O
honestly O
tell O
you O
that O
this O
hair O
dryer O
is O
awesome O
! O

Love U-quality
the O
retractable O

the O

quickly O
dries O
my O
hair O
. O

Dryer O
does O
not O
work O
good O
at O
all O
! O
The O
high O
setting O
is O
more O
like O
using O
the O
low O

No O

! O
I O
have O
another O
Revlon O
Travel O
version O
I O
bought O
at O
Walmart O
for O
12 O
dollars O
and O
works O
so O
much O
better O
than O
this O
. O
Very O
disappointed O

waste O

If O

the O

this O

Agonizingly O

I O
have O
nin O
type O
of O
complaint O
, O
I O
am O
satisfied O
recommend O
this O
seller O
and O
product O

Very O
light U-usability
dryer O
, O
and O
has O
a O
nice O
grip O
and O
feel O
to O
the O
handle O
. O
  O
I O
have O
very O
long O
hair O
and O
it O
dried O
my O
hair O
very O
fast O
with O
very O
little O
frizz O
. O
  O
I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
dryer O
. O
  O
I O
love O
it O
! O

Just O
like O
the O
ones O
in O
hotel O
. O

Folds O
up O
perfectly U-quality
, O
good B-temperature
heat L-temperature
and O
power U-power
. O

Works B-quality
well L-quality
but O
you O
need O
a O
lot O
of O
space O
to O
store O
it O
. O
  O
It O
's O
like O
a O
giant O
robotic O
arm O
. O

Good U-quality
little U-appearance
dryer O
. O
  O
Cord O
running O
from O
wall O
to O
unit O
little O
too O
short O
. O

Small U-appearance
and O
convenient U-usability
, O
however O
heat O
seems O
low O
and O
hairdryer O
is O
rather O
loud O
. O

I O
am O
so O
happy U-quality
with O
this O
dryer O
! O
It O
's O
not O
too O
loud U-noisy
, O
like O
the O
design O
, O
and O
easy O
to O
pack O
. O
The O
only O
thing O
that O
would O
make O
it O
a O
perfect O
dryer O
would O
be O
if O
it O
had O
a O
medium O
setting O
. O
I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
the O
Andis O
dryer O
. O

Awesome U-quality
hair O
dryer O

GREAT U-quality
dryer O
for O
the O
price O
... O
nice U-quality
features O
... O
the O
light O
may O
be O
just O
a O
bit O
too O
bright O
, O
but O
if O
you O
need O
a O
nightlight O
, O
its O
' O
great O
. O

Love U-quality
it O
! O
Dries O
hair O
fast O
without O
tangles O
! O

I O
love U-quality
this O
hairdryer O
because O
it O
's O
small O
, O
and O
lightweight O
, O
yet O
quite O
powerful O
, O
both O
in O
heat O
and O
flow O
. O
  O
The O
switch O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
use O
, O
and O
I O
prefer O
a O
small O
white O
hairdryer O
to O
be O
accidentally O
seen O
on O
the O
bathroom O
counter O
, O
instead O
of O
a O
huge O
heavy O
clunky O
black O
and O
chrome O
model O
that O
does O
n't O
fit O
in O
a O
drawer O
when O
I O
need O
to O
tidy O
up O
. O
  O
This O
one O
is O
also O
small O
enough O
for O
travel O
. O

This O
is O
a O
nice B-appearance
looking L-appearance
hair O
dryer O
that O
works O
fast O
. O
My O
hair O
usually O
frizzes O
out O
when O
I O
blow O
dry O
it O
, O
but O
not O
with O
this O
. O
My O
hair O
did O
not O
feel O
dried O
out O
at O
all O
after O
using O
this O
. O
The O
blow O
dryer O
has O
hot O
, O
warm O
and O
cool O
settings O
with O
a O
cool O
blast O
button O
. O
The O
back O
opens O
easily O
, O
so O
that O
any O
dust O
buildup O
can O
be O
removed O
. O
The O
weight O
is O
a O
bit O
heavy O
, O
but O
the O
design O
makes O
it O
nice O
to O
hold O
. O
I O
took O
off O
one O
star O
because O
the O
diffuser O
did O
not O
do O
a O
great O
job O
on O
my O
wimpy O
curls O
, O
but O
the O
other O
attachments O
worked O
out O
well O
for O
me O
. O
The O
color O
is O
nice O
, O
but O
if O
it O
came O
in O
green O
, O
that O
would O
be O
even O
better O
. O
The O
best O
blow O
dryer O
I O
have O
used O
so O
far O
. O

Good U-quality
item O

Amazing U-quality
design O
! O
Good O
power U-power
, O
comfortable O
to O
use O
! O

Our O
old O
hair O
dryer O
has O
seen O
better O
days O
, O
so O
my O
niece O
picked O
this O
one O
because O
pink O
is O
her O
favorite U-quality
color U-appearance
. O
Revlon O
is O
a O
name O
that O
's O
been O
involved O
with O
hair O
, O
so O
I O
said O
why O
not O
. O
The O
dryer O
seems O
to O
dry O
hair O
well O
, O
and O
my O
niece O
likes O
the O
color O
, O
so O
it O
's O
a O
win O
- O
win O
! O

Admittedly O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
ton O
of O
hair O
, O
and O
while O
this O
is O
a O
really O
nice U-quality
blow O
dryer O
, O
if O
you O
're O
a O
guy O
with O
short O
hair O
, O
it O
's O
pretty O
extravagant O
. O
My O
wife O
and O
daughter O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
noticed O
a O
huge O
difference O
. O
My O
daughter O
is O
n't O
a O
huge O
fan O
of O
getting O
her O
hair O
dryed O
, O
and O
happily O
, O
this O
dryer O
reduces O
the O
torture O
time O
exponentially O
. O
I O
want O
to O
say O
the O
difference O
is O
in O
the O
diffuser O
, O
but O
there O
's O
more O
going O
on O
here O
. O
It O
is O
n't O
quite O
magical O
, O
but O
it O
's O
close O
. O
The O
magical O
part O
is O
probably O
with O
my O
wife O
's O
naturally O
curly O
hair O
. O
During O
the O
winter O
months O
, O
there O
's O
been O
some O
investment O
in O
products O
that O
control O
frizz O
, O
and O
I O
've O
been O
able O
to O
casually O
tell O
a O
difference O
between O
products O
. O
With O
this O
hair O
dryer O
, O
though O
, O
you O
'd O
swear O
some O
really O
expensive O
salon O
- O
grade O
stuff O
was O
used O
. O
The O
results O
are O
pretty O
surprising O
, O
and O
seem O
to O
last O
. O
I O
'd O
almost O
go O
as O
far O
as O
saying O
that O
this O
could O
save O
money O
, O
by O
reducing O
( O
or O
eliminating O
) O
the O
need O
for O
control O
products O
. O
At O
first O
, O
I O
was O
positive O
there O
was O
no O
way O
this O
hair O
dryer O
would O
be O
worth O
the O
money O
, O
but O
seeing O
how O
well O
it O
works O
with O
everyone O
in O
the O
family O
, O
I O
'd O
totally O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
with O
curly O
hair O
, O
or O
who O
ca O
n't O
tolerate O
much O
time O
under O
the O
dryer O
. O

We O
liked O
the O
convenience U-usability
so O
well O
that O
we O
bought O
one O
for O
the O
guest O
bathroom O
too O
. O

I O
first O
tried O
this O
hairdryer O
while O
staying O
at O
a O
Marriott O
Resort O
. O
  O
I O
loved U-quality
it O
so O
much O
that O
I O
purchased O
3 O
of O
them O
. O
  O
It O
can O
be O
set O
to O
blow O
at O
  O
the O
highest O
power O
with O
the O
heat O
at O
a O
lower O
setting O
-- O
something O
I O
found O
to O
be O
perfect O
for O
me O
. O

Best U-quality
dryer O
out O
there O
! O
use O
it O
daily O

So O
, O
I O
got O
this O
in O
hopes O
that O
it O
would O
inspire O
me O
to O
completely O
blow O
out O
my O
hair O
. O
  O
Looks B-appearance
great L-appearance
when O
the O
hairdresser O
does O
it O
but O
I O
get O
bored O
about O
halfway O
through O
. O
  O
The O
jury O
is O
still O
out- O
three O
neat O
attachments O
that O
I O
have O
never O
in O
my O
life O
used O
and O
more O
options O
than O
I O
know O
what O
to O
do O
with- O
cool O
, O
warm O
hot O
and O
then O
high O
and O
low O
, O
and O
finally O
a O
cold O
burst O
.... O
I'm O
used O
to O
just O
on O
or O
off!it O
is O
a O
little O
top O
heavy O
so O
not O
the O
most O
comfortable O
. O
  O
But O
so O
far O
so O
good O
. O

the O

and O
it O
's O
beautiful!!!this O
model O
is O
a O
little O
bit O
heavier U-usability
than O
the O
Babyliss O
TT O
tourmaline O
titanium O
( O
the O
white O
one O
) O
, O
but O
it O
does O
dry O
the O
hair O
in O
HALF O
the O
time O
! O
! O
! O
I O
have O
long O
hair O
around O
the O
middle O
of O
my O
back O
and O
I O
dried O
it O
completely O
in O
4m25s O
. O
With O
the O
Babyliss O
TT O
it O
would O
take O
about O
8 O
- O
9 O
minutes O
. O
Do O
this O
is O
completely O
worth O
it O
! O
! O
! O
! O

I O
like O
that O
the O
speed U-dryingspeed
of O
the O
blower O
is O
separate O
from O
the O
heat O
selection O
. O

love U-quality
my O
dryer O

I O
tested O
this O
hair O
dryer O
against O
two O
older O
models O
we O
have O
. O
One O
was O
a O
Conair O
with O
ceramics O
in O
the O
wind O
tunnel O
and O
ionizer O
. O
The O
other O
was O
an O
older O
BayBliss O
hair O
dryer O
, O
also O
with O
ceramics O
but O
no O
advertized O
ionizing O
properties O
. O
I O
did O
n't O
use O
a O
towel O
at O
all O
for O
the O
tests O
because O
I O
figured O
, O
if O
it O
works B-quality
as I-quality
advertized L-quality
, O
the O
Panasonic O
should O
dry O
out O
my O
skin O
less O
well O
too O
. O
It O
seems O
to O
work O
. O
All O
three O
are O
very B-quality
good L-quality
hair O
dryers O
. O
I O
think O
the O
Panasonic O
did O
the O
best O
job O
of O
not O
fizzing O
up O
my O
hair O
and O
leaving O
it O
feeling O
very O
nice O
. O
HOWEVER O
, O
it O
stinks O
! O
It O
smelled O
like O
I O
was O
blowing O
melted O
plastic O
all O
around O
the O
room O
. O
That O
is O
not O
the O
case O
when O
I O
use O
either O
the O
Conair O
or O
the O
BayBliss O
. O
Additionally O
, O
while O
both O
the O
others O
are O
premium O
models O
, O
neither O
cost O
more O
than O
$ O
50.I'm O
going O
to O
let O
the O
Panasonic O
air O
out O
for O
a O
month O
or O
so O
outdoors O
in O
the O
sun O
. O
Maybe O
some O
of O
the O
plastic O
stink O
will O
outgas O
and O
it O
will O
be O
a O
great O
hair O
dryer O
. O
Many O
people O
are O
n't O
as O
sensitive O
as O
I O
am O
to O
these O
plastic O
odors O
. O
If O
you O
love O
that O
new O
car O
smell O
, O
especially O
the O
smell O
of O
mostly O
plastic O
interiors O
after O
they O
have O
baked O
in O
the O
sun O
with O
the O
windows O
up O
, O
you O
'll O
love O
the O
smell O
of O
the O
Panasonic O
. O
I O
ca O
n't O
stand O
the O
smell O
of O
Fabreze O
or O
Bounce O
but O
maybe O
you O
think O
they O
're O
wonderful O
. O
If O
so O
, O
you O
'll O
think O
this O
dryer O
is O
to O
die O
for O
. O
I O
think O
they O
have O
the O
makings O
of O
a O
very O
good O
product O
. O
That O
nanoe O
technology O
seems O
to O
work O
. O
However O
, O
I O
'm O
concerned O
that O
each O
of O
those O
tiny O
little O
water O
droplets O
is O
surrounded O
by O
plastic O
particles O
, O
making O
it O
all O
the O
easier O
to O
find O
its O
way O
to O
my O
lungs O
. O
Hopefully O
, O
airing O
out O
will O
do O
the O
trick O
but O
I O
would O
still O
recommend O
a O
redesign O
to O
keep O
the O
hot O
air O
away O
from O
plastic O
parts O
. O
Addendum O
: O
I O
initially O
gave O
the O
product O
5 O
stars O
but O
upon O
reflection O
I O
have O
decided O
there O
is O
no O
excuse O
for O
putting O
out O
a O
product O
that O
runs O
hot O
air O
directly O
past O
plastic O
when O
companies O
have O
been O
making O
hair O
dryers O
with O
metal O
or O
ceramic O
coated O
nozzles O
for O
years O
. O
Yes O
, O
recycling O
water O
vapor O
is O
a O
great O
idea O
, O
but O
do O
n't O
forget O
to O
use O
the O
best O
of O
older O
technology O
as O
well O
. O
Plus O
a O
hair O
dryer O
this O
expensive O
should O
have O
a O
dual O
voltage O
switch O
. O
Update O
: O
Because O
of O
the O
smell O
, O
I O
gave O
the O
hair O

About O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
in O
and O
it O
's O
no O
longer O
working O
. O
Not O
an O
awful O
timeline O
but O
disappointing O
for O
the O
price O
. O

so O
far O
so O
good O

Exclent O
product O
, O
just O
two O
minutes O
tondy O
my O
hair O
without O
damage O

this O
blow O
dryer O
is O
good O
at O
first O
but O
it O
's O
quite O
tricky O
. O
The O
blow O
dryer O
begins O
getting O
very O
smokey O
.. O
Something O
about O
the O
smell O
of O
the O
blow O
dryer O
does O
n't O
seem O
right O
. O
I O
wish O
I O
listened O
to O
the O
reviews O
because O
the O
blow O
dryer O
died O
after O
one O
month O
and O
a O
day O
. O
A O
lot O
of O
smoke O
and O
fire O
flames O
came O
out O
of O
the O
blow O
dryer O
. O
Very O
scary O
. O
Do O
not O
but O
this O
blow O
dryer O
it O
may O
be O
okay O
at O
first O
but O
once O
you O
start O
smelling O
the O
burnt O
smell O
tuh O
better O
think O
twice O
when O
the O
return O
days O
are O
up O
. O
Waste O
of O
money O
! O
Do O
not O
buy O
this O
item O
. O
Going O
to O
stick O
to O
the O
cheap O
blow O
dryers O
. O
This O
was O
expensive O
for O
no O
reason O
perhaps O
maybe O
the O
watts O
? O
( O
1900 O
) O
only O
good O
thing O
about O
this O
blow O
dryer O
it O
speeds O
up O
your O
drying O
time O
a+ O
for O
that O
. O

Works O
well O

I O
always O
thought O
a O
blow O
dryer O
was O
a O
blow O
dryer O
and O
they O
all O
did O
the O
same O
thing O
. O
  O
Boy O
was O
I O
wrong O
about O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
It O
is O
not O
the O
same O
as O
all O
the O
others O
. O
  O
I O
have O
straight O
, O
thick O
hair O
and O
have O
a O
hard O
time O
getting O
volume O
due O
to O
the O
weight O
of O
my O
hair O
making O
it O
lay O
flat O
. O
  O
I O
do O
blow O
dry O
my O
hair O
to O
give O
it O
some O
volume O
but O
it O
usually O
does O
n't O
last O
long O
. O
  O
But O
with O
the O
Panasonic O
hair O
dryer O
, O
I O
get O
so O
much O
volume O
! O
It O
is O
amazing O
! O
  O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
is O
due O
to O
the O
moisture O
being O
put O
back O
into O
the O
hair O
but O
my O
hair O
looks O
great O
and O
others O
have O
told O
me O
the O
same O
thing O
. O
  O
My O
hair O
also O
seems O
to O
hold O
the O
volume O
almost O
all O
day O
long O
which O
is O
unusual O
for O
my O
hair O
. O
At O
first O
the O
dryer O
took O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
getting O
used O
to O
as O
it O
is O
a O
bit O
bulky O
, O
but O
it O
is O
light O
weight O
. O
  O
After O
a O
few O
days O
I O
got O
the O
hang O
of O
it O
and O
now O
I O
am O
getting O
the O
most O
out O
of O
the O
dryer O
. O
  O
Several O
heat O
setting O
make O
blow O
drying O
easy O
to O
get O
the O
results O
that O
you O
want O
. O
  O
Love O
it O
! O

Good O
! O

bulky O
and O
too O
noisy O
.. O

Amazing O

LOVE O
this O
hair O
dryer O
! O
It O
is O
excellent O
for O
drying O
curly O
hair O
, O
which O
needs O
intense O
heat O
in O
one O
area O
. O
Light O
weight O
and O
not O
overly O
bulky O
, O
this O
hair O
dryer O
has O
a O
nice O
handle O
that O
is O
easy O
to O
grip O
and O
use O
when O
you O
have O
to O
dry O
hair O
for O
awhile O
. O
Curly O
hair O
sure O
can O
take O
time O
to O
dry O
and O
this O
one O
does O
not O
make O
your O
arm O
or O
grip O
ache O
, O
due O
to O
the O
long O
use O
. O
I O
recommend O
for O
anyone O
who O
wants O
a O
great O
, O
affordable O
lighter O
dryer O
that O
has O
concentrated O
heat O
! O

I O
have O
to O
say O
, O
this O
dryer O
is O
amazing O
! O
I O
have O
long O
, O
thick O
, O
naturally O
curly O
hair O
, O
and O
I O
use O
a O
hair O
dryer O
a O
few O
times O
a O
week O
with O
a O
round O
ceramic O
brush O
to O
straighten O
it O
. O
I O
previously O
had O
a O
$ O
150 O
professional O
grade O
dryer O
( O
5 O
years O
, O
and O
it O
finally O
died O
) O
, O
and O
I O
did O
some O
research O
prior O
to O
buying O
a O
new O
one O
to O
see O
if O
I O
could O
save O
that O
expense O
. O
I O
bought O
this O
dryer O
and O
I O
was O
shocked O
that O
it O
actually O
worked O
BETTER O
than O
my O
$ O
150 O
dryer O
! O
My O
hair O
is O
softer O
, O
the O
blow O
out O
lasts O
longer O
, O
and O
it O
dried O
faster O
then O
my O
old O
dryer O
. O
Must O
buy O
! O
If O
it O
works O
on O
my O
difficult O
to O
straighten O
hair O
, O
it O
will O
definitely O
work O
on O
anyones O
! O

I O
m O
amazed O
at O
the O
negative O
reviews O
. O
I O
have O
had O
this O
dryer O
for O
about O
3 O
years O
and O
it O
is O
my O
favorite O
. O
Recently O
, O
the O
retracable O
cord O
has O
nt O
worked O
well O
, O
I O
tried O
to O
open O
it O
to O
fix O
it O
, O
then O
I O
broke O
off O
another O
part O
. O
Now O
, O
I O
use O
this O
dryer O
1 O
- O
2x O
/ O
day O
. O
I O
paid O
under O
$ O
20 O
at O
Walmart O
, O
so O
I O
sure O
got O
my O
moneys O
worth O
. O
I O
ordered O
a O
conair O
here O
on O
Amazon O
that O
I O
will O
be O
returning O
and O
purchasing O
this O
one O
AGAIN.It O
is O
VERY O
powerful O
, O
I O
love O
the O
retracting O
cord O
and O
fold O
up O
handle O
. O

Works O
great O
. O
I O
replaced O
my O
Sharper O
Image O
ion O
dryer O
after O
10 O
years O
with O
this O
model O
. O
It O
works O
great O
and O
has O
the O
same O
specs O
as O
my O
other O
model O
. O
Only O
at O
a O
fraction O
of O
the O
price O
! O
Highly O
recommend O
. O

So O
far O
, O
the O
hair O
dryer O
has O
worked O
great O
. O
I O
gave O
it O
only O
four O
stars O
because O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
move O
the O
slide O
controls O
for O
the O
heat O
setting O
and O
for O
the O
blower O
setting O
, O
which O
are O
side O
by O
side O
. O
So O
, O
I O
just O
leave O
the O
controls O
set O
where O
I O
want O
and O
plug O
and O
unplug O
the O
dryer O
so O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
change O
the O
controls O
after O
I O
plug O
it O
in O
. O
If O
I O
remember O
, O
I O
will O
write O
another O
review O
in O
one O
year O
, O
if O
it O
lasts O
that O
long O
! O

Does O
a O
good O
job O
for O
the O
price O
. O
I O
like O
the O
diffuser O
. O

Just O
received O
it O
; O
yesterday O
; O
delivered O
on O
time O
, O
no O
problem O
. O
  O
It O
's O
so O
cute O
and O
improbable O
, O
like O
a O
Barbie O
- O
doll O
toy O
hairdryer O
in O
very O
pink O
plastic O
, O
just O
like O
its O
picture O
online O
in O
its O
box O
, O
complete O
with O
miniature O
pink O
plastic O
diffuser O
& O
concentrator O
. O
But O
it O
works O
as O
well O
as O
a O
larger O
hairdryer O
, O
certainly O
far O
, O
far O
better O
than O
a O
hotel O
wall O
dryer O
, O
and O
better O
than O
some O
full O
- O
sized O
ones O
, O
too O
. O
And O
it O
is O
extremely O
light O
, O
not O
tiring O
on O
the O
arms O
. O
The O
diffuser O
successfully O
brought O
out O
waves O
in O
my O
hair O
; O
the O
concentrator O
straightened O
my O
bangs O
. O
  O
I O
bought O
it O
to O
fit O
in O
my O
carry O
- O
on O
luggage O
, O
which O
it O
does O
nicely O
. O
What O
's O
not O
to O
like O
? O

I O
have O
had O
a O
hair O
dryer O
for O
years O
when O
it O
gave O
out O
. O
I O
have O
always O
used O
Con O
Air O
products O
and O
have O
been O
very O
happy O
with O
them O
. O
This O
hair O
dryer O
does O
NOT O
disappoint O
. O
  O
Great O
product O
has O
several O
sets O
to O
choose O
from O
and O
a O
cool O
button O
which O
is O
really O
neat O
feature O
I O
never O
had O
that O
before O
. O
It O
has O
high O
power O
but O
not O
overwhelming O
for O
you O
or O
your O
hair O
. O
Love O
this O
product O
and O
love O
Conair O
! O

Excellent O
product O
..... O

Like O
many O
people O
, O
I O
have O
been O
buying O
the O
very O
cheap O
hairdryers O
sold O
at O
consumer O
retail O
stores O
like O
KMart O
and O
Walmart O
. O
I O
assumed O
they O
were O
good O
enough O
but O
they O
never O
last O
very O
long O
. O
I O
finally O
decided O
to O
get O
a O
pro O
model O
. O
This O
hairdryer O
is O
what O
my O
hair O
stylist O
has O
so O
I O
decided O
to O
try O
it O
. O
I O
am O
sorry O
I O
waited O
so O
long O
to O
treat O
myself O
to O
such O
a O
nice O
experience O
. O
The O
quality O
of O
the O
air O
flow O
, O
the O
excellent O
sound O
and O
the O
overall O
feel O
is O
well O
worth O
the O
cost O
. O
I O
hope O
it O
will O
last O
many O
years O
. O
I O
do O
wish O
the O
diffuser O
had O
come O
with O
it O
. O
However O
I O
have O
one O
on O
order O
. O
Also O
I O
took O
off O
a O
star O
because O
I O
would O
like O
high O
heat O
on O
low O
fan O
to O
be O
just O
a O
little O
hotter O
. O

Light O
weight O
and O
efficient O
. O
  O
Very O
easy O
to O
use O
. O
  O
Just O
what O
I O
wanted O
for O
travel O
, O
when O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
take O
my O
big O
heavy O
dryer O
. O

Good O
solid O
unit O
. O
  O
Feels O
super O
well O
constructed O
. O
  O
I O
am O
an O
electrical O
engineer O
and O
appreciate O
the O
solid O
heavy O
motor O
. O
  O
This O
likely O
means O
it O
will O
last O
. O
  O
It O
moves O
a O
bunch O
of O
air O
. O
  O
It O
heats O
quickly O
and O
strongly O
without O
odor O
. O
  O
Does O
a O
terrific O
job O
on O
hair O
. O
  O
Noise O
level O
is O
quite O
low O
for O
the O
amount O
of O
air O
its O
moving O
. O
  O
The O
surface O
finish O
remains O
excellent O
after O
6 O
months O
of O
heavy O

  O
My O
wife O
loves O
it O
. O
  O
The O
buttons O
are O
placed O
such O
that O
neither O
one O
of O
us O
inadvertently O
changes O
the O
settings O
during O
use O

  O
Neither O
of O
use O
uses O
the O
attachments O
so O
no O
help O
there O
. O
While O
I O
stress O
the O
solid O
feel O
of O
the O
unit O
as O
a O
good O
thing O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
feel O
it O
is O
too O
heavy O
and O
neither O
does O
my O
wife O
. O
  O
I O
guess O
it O
depends O
on O
your O
expectations O
. O
  O
It O
will O
probably O
strike O
some O
as O
too O
heavy O
. O
  O
Not O
us O
. O

Excellent O
product O
for O
such O
a O
great O
price O

Hearts O
well O

folds O
even O
better O

UPDATE O
... O
   O
After O
using O
it O
maybe O
once O
a O
month O
( O
4 O
- O
5 O
times O
since O
purchase O
) O
the O
retractable O
cord O
no O
longer O
works O
. O
Very O
surprised O
because O
it O
seemed O
like O
a O
pretty O
good O
product O
. O
Still O
works O
decently O
well O
but O
that O
sucks O
! O

It O
is O
the O
best O

Super O
Deal O
. O
  O
Super O
Price O
. O
  O
I O
bought O
this O
on O
Amazon O
after O
reading O
reviews O
. O
  O
It O
works O
great O
. O
  O
I O
have O
no O
complaints O
whatsoever O
. O

Switch O
is O
hard O
to O
turn O
on O
/ O
off O
. O

I O
got O
a O
pro O
- O
versa O
instead O
of O
jerdon O
, O
amazon O
says O
pro O
- O
versa O
makes O
jerdon O
, O
no O
speeds O
or O
heat O
settings O
, O
just O
on O
and O
off O
button O
, O
unfortunately O
its O
already O
  O
on O
wall O
, O
did O
not O
notice O
til O
after O
, O
heck O
of O
a O
time O
putting O
it O
up O
also O
, O
very O
difficult O
, O
will O
not O
buy O
again O

Fine O
product O

The O
on O
off O
switch O
is O
broken O
. O
The O
only O
way O
to O
turn O
it O
on O
is O
by O
pressing O
white O
button O
on O
plug O
and O
turn O
it O
off O
by O
unplugging O
. O
  O
Not O
what O
I O
normally O
expect O
from O
an O
Amazon O
or O
Revlon O
product O
. O

The O
retracting O
cable O
feature O
stopped O
working O
on O
me O
after O
a O
year O
. O
The O
dryer O
still O
works O
great O
after O
every O
day O
use O
. O

Boughtt O
in O
July O
2013 O
.... O
now O
the O
hot O
setting O
goes O
from O
hot O
to O
cold O
all O
while O
in O
the O
HOT O
setting O
..... O

Easliy O
installed O
and O
works O
well O
..... O

works O
great O

When O
it O
works O
, O
it O
a O
lightweight O
and O
powerful O
hair O
dryer O
. O
However O
, O
it O
started O
to O
make O
weird O
noises O
and O
squeaky O
sounds O
after O
1 O
year O
and O
three O
months O
. O
Other O
hair O
dryers O
I O
used O
usually O
last O
more O
than O
2.5 O
years O
! O

This O
is O
a O
really O
good O
hair O
dryer O
. O
Most O
other O
models O
either O
have O
low O
airflow O
or O
are O
very O
loud O
and O
hurt O
my O
ears O
. O
This O
one O
is O
hot O
, O
has O
high O
airflow O
and O
the O
sound O
is O
soft O
and O
easy O
on O
my O
sensitive O
ears O
. O

Great O
product O
and O
price O
. O
Strong O
airflow O
and O
nice O
setting O
options O
. O
Get O
's O
my O
very O
long O
hair O
dry O
fast O
. O
Replaced O
older O
model O
that O
I O
had O
had O
for O
over O
5 O
years O
. O
Hope O
this O
one O
last O
as O
long O

This O
is O
lightweight O
and O
powerful O
. O
  O
I O
bought O
three O
of O
them O
so O
that O
I O
could O
use O
two O
as O
gifts O
. O
  O
I O
love O
it O
. O

Dries O
my O
hair O
very O
quickly O
, O
the O
different O
heat O
settings O
are O
wonderful O
! O
It O
works O
perfectly O
. O

Really O
good O
blow O
dryer O
my O
first O
1 O
finally O
just O
burnt O
out O
after O
4 O
years O
, O
and O
I O
refuse O
to O
use O
a O
different O
blow O
dryer O
besides O
this O
1 O
... O
So O
I O
'm O
onto O
my O
second O
1 O
but O
hey O
after O
4 O
years O
its O
about O
that O
time O
! O

Worst O
blow O
dryer O
I O
have O
ever O
purchased O
. O
  O
The O
attachments O
do O
not O
slide O
on O
well O
, O
it O
does O
not O
dry O
my O
hair O
well O
, O
and O
the O
bristles O
on O
the O
brush O
are O
n't O
stiff O
enough O
. O
  O
Unfortunately O
I O
missed O
my O
window O
to O
return O
the O
item O
. O
I O
'll O
have O
to O
buy O
another O
brand O
and O
will O
just O
keep O
this O
one O
in O
the O
garage O
if O
I O
ever O
need O
to O
blow O
something O
dry O
. O
  O
At O
least O
it O
was O
n't O
very O
expensive O
. O

T3 O
makes O
the O
best O
hair O
dryers O
. O
This O
is O
my O
third O
T3 O
dryer O
... O
the O
first O
I O
had O
for O
4yrs O
it O
only O
broke O
after O
being O
dropped O
for O
the O
tenth O
time O
, O
the O
second O
I O
had O
for O
2yrs O
it O
shorted O
out O
on O
vacation O
in O
Cuba O
( O
no O
fault O
of O
the O
dryers O
just O
my O
own O
stupidity O
, O
they O
are O
made O
well O
& O
to O
last O
) O
and O
this O
third O
T3 O
I O
've O
had O
for O
1yr O
. O
I O
have O
long O
, O
thick O
, O
corse O
, O
frizz O
prone O
hair O
& O
used O
to O
burn O
out O
other O
hair O
dryers O
in O
only O
a O
few O
uses O
whereas O
these O
T3 O
dryers O
dry O
it O
super O
fast O
with O
no O
frizz O
& O
it O
looks O
shiny O
after O
and O
they O
last O
forever O
. O
The O
concentrated O
nozzle O
is O
great O
for O
smooth O
looks O
and O
I O
love O
the O
diffuser O
for O
beachy O
waves O
. O
Invest O
in O
this O
dryer O
and O
you O
wo O
n't O
be O
sorry O
, O
just O
do O
n't O
take O
it O
on O
vacation O
& O
it O
will O
last O
for O
years O
and O
years O
. O

mom O
loves O
it O
and O
it O
works O
so O
I O
guess O
it O
's O
great O
. O

Do O
n't O
waste O
your O
money O
. O
I O
bought O
this O
for O
my O
14 O
yr O
old O
daughter O
for O
Christmas O
. O
She O
was O
very O
disappointed O
& O
so O
was O
I O
! O
It O
has O
only O
been O
used O
or O
attempted O
to O
use O
just O
once O
. O
After O
5 O
minutes O
of O
frustration O
my O
daughter O
gave O
up O
trying O
to O
dry O
her O
hair O
saying O
that O
it O
just O
does O
n't O
get O
hard O
or O
blow O
hardly O
any O
air O
. O
  O
We O
're O
keeping O
it O
to O
blow O
dry O
our O
dog O
, O
a O
small O
pekingese O
. O
Other O
than O
that O
, O
it O
's O
useless O
. O
  O
Again O
, O
save O
your O
money O
& O
skip O
this O
product O

Very O
high O
powered O
drying O
with O
3 O
heat O
settings O
, O
and O
3 O
power O
settings O
. O
  O
Really O
like O
the O
way O
it O
streamlines O
the O
air O
. O
  O
Have O
not O
tried O
the O
diffuser O
yet O
but O
I O
am O
sure O
it O
works O
well O
. O
  O
Got O
it O
to O
replace O
a O
20 O
year O
old O
dryer O
that O
was O
on O
its O
last O
leg O
. O
  O
Only O
one O
coil O
was O
working O
. O
  O
Dries O
my O
hair O
in O
about O
a O
third O
of O
the O
time O
. O
  O
Would O
recommend O
to O
a O
friend O
. O

It O
is O
hard O
to O
find O
a O
pistol O
style O
hair O
dryer O
these O
day O
. O
I O
assume O
that O
majority O
went O
less O
bulky O
shape O
because O
it O
look O
nicer O
. O
My O
first O
priority O
is O
quiet O
operations O
and O
this O
pistol O
shape O
produce O
quieter O
air O
flows O
. O

I O
like O
the O
blow O
dryer O
. O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
going O
to O
be O
a O
compact O
size O
but O
nope O
its O
a O
big O
one O
. O
I O
love O
the O
color O
and O
its O
very O
light O
weight O

Just O
got O
the O
Remington O
last O
week O
, O
ca O
nt O
be O
more O
happy O
with O
it O
. O
The O
three O
temperatures O
on O
it O
are O
just O
right O
I O
am O
excited O
to O
say O
that O
  O
there O
is O
an O
actual O
difference O
between O
hot O
and O
warm O
air O
. O
Unlike O
most O
other O
hair O
dryers O
this O
one O
does O
not O
damage O
or O
overheat O
  O
my O
hair O
. O
  O
After O
I O
'm O
done O
using O
it O
my O
hair O
feels O
soft O
and O
does O
n't O
feel O
tangled O
. O
Another O
great O
thing O
about O
it O
is O
the O
amount O
if O
air O
this O
little O
guy O
pushes O
out O
. O
I O
can O
dry O
my O
hair O
on O
a O
cool O
setting O
withing O
5 O
minutes O
no O
problem O
, O
and O
if O
I O
use O
warm O
air O
it O
takes O
me O
about O
3 O
minutes O
. O
This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
pretty O
light O
weight O
so O
styling O
my O
hair O
easy O
and O
takes O
little O
time O
. O
Love O
this O
model O
especially O
with O
the O
cost O
of O
it O
. O
It O
's O
a O
GREAT O
BUY O
. O
If O
you O
are O
in O
the O
market O
for O
a O
good O
hair O
dryer O
, O
  O
and O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
reasonable O
price O
this O
is O
it O
. O
  O
worth O
every O
penny O
. O

what O
an O
ingenious O
idea O
! O
! O
! O
  O
great O
hair O
dryer O
! O

This O
dryer O
is O
amazing O

Purchased O
in O
February O
2014 O
and O
quit O
working O
in O
November O
2014 O
. O
  O
I O
should O
have O
heeded O
the O
other O
negative O
reviews O
. O
  O
And O
if O
Amazon O
were O
brick O
and O
mortar O
or O
had O
a O
phone O
number O
where O
I O
could O
contact O
them O
, O
then O
possibly O
we O
could O
have O
at O
least O
discussed O
, O
and/or O
they O
could O
have O
offered O
to O
replace O
the O
dryer O
with O
a O
working O
one O
. O
  O
It O
only O
worked O
for O
nine O
months O
; O
come O
on O
.... O

It O
takes O
some O
precision O
switching O
fr O
hot O
to O
cool O
& O
vise O
- O
versa O
, O
otherwise O
it O
's O
great O
& O
I O
can O
mount O
on O
the O
wall O
folded O
in O
half O
w O
/ O
no O
cord O
. O

I O
have O
always O
hated O
blow O
drying O
my O
hair O
, O
but O
this O
dryer O
makes O
it O
easier O
due O
to O
the O
handle O
being O
so O
thin O
. O
I O
usually O
use O
it O
on O
low O
settings O
and O
it O
works O
great O
. O
I O
love O
this O
hair O
dyer O
. O

Perfect O
size O
for O
gym O

It O
's O
the O
best O
hair O
dryer O
ever O
! O
Love O
it O
soooooo O
much O
. O
After O
using O
it O
, O
my O
hair O
becomes O
more O
shining O
and O
healthy O
. O
Definitely O
recommended O
for O
everyone O
! O

Be O
careful O
that O
you O
are O
selecting O
what O
you O
want O
. O
  O
I O
did O
n't O
read O
the O
description O
closely O
and O
thought O
it O
was O
the O
kind O
of O
dryer O
I O
was O
replacing O
that O
wired O
into O
the O
wall O
. O
  O
This O
one O
plugs O
in O
to O
an O
outlet O
and O
it O
has O
been O
a O
challenge O
to O
mount O
since O
the O
footprint O
of O
the O
base O
is O
smaller O
than O
the O
one O
I O
had O
previously O
. O
  O
My O
fault O
, O
not O
theirs O
, O
but O
the O
image O
looks O
exactly O
like O
what O
I O
had O
. O
  O
We O
eventully O
bought O
a O
picture O
frame O
, O
put O
scrapbook O
paper O
in O
it O
and O
bolted O
the O
dryer O
mounting O
to O
the O
frame O
and O
the O
frame O
to O
the O
wall O
to O
cover O
the O
previous O
dryer O
's O
footprint O
. O
  O
A O
bit O
of O
a O
challenge O
, O
but O
the O
result O
looks O
OK O
. O

This O
hair O
dryer O
does O
a O
wonderful O
job O
. O
  O
My O
hair O
comes O
out O
shiny O
and O
, O
with O
the O

that O
is O
included O
, O
I O
can O
maintain O
the O
curls O
and O
waves O
that O
are O
natural O
to O
my O
hair O
. O
  O
The O
nozzle O
can O
be O
set O
for O
precision O
when O
drying O
and O
there O
is O
a O
cool O
shot O
button O
in O
case O
the O
air O
feels O
too O
hot O
. O
  O
Three O
temperature O
settings O
make O
this O
dryer O
versatile O
and O
useful O
for O
wet O
or O
damp O
hair O
. O
  O
There O
is O
also O
a O
quick O
- O
dry O
nozzle O
attachment O
that O
disperses O
air O
throughout O
the O
head O
and O
makes O
drying O
very O
quick O
. O
  O
I O
would O
only O
recommend O
this O
if O
you O
are O
in O
a O
  O
rush O
because O
I O
found O
my O
hair O
duller O
looking O
when O
I O
used O
this O
attachment O
. O
  O
However O
, O
there O
are O
days O
when O
a O
quick O
dry O
comes O
in O
very O
handy O
. O
  O
The O
hair O
dryer O
's O
description O
says O
that O
it O
utilizes O
ions O
in O
the O
air O
to O
maintain O
moisture O
in O
your O
hair O
. O
  O
Whatever O
method O
it O
uses O
, O
it O
really O
works O
and O
is O
the O
nicest O
dryer O
I O
've O
ever O
had O
. O

It O
did O
not O
fir O
my O
hair O
dryer O
. O

Hair O
dryer O
is O
very O
suitable O
for O
my O
fine O
, O
short O
and O
not O
very O
thick O
hair O
. O
I O
used O
it O
on O
the O
lowest O
setting O
and O
it O
felt O
just O
right O
: O
gentle O
and O
not O
extremely O
hot O
. O
I O
also O
liked O
its O
comb O
attachment O
: O
it O
helped O
me O
dry O
hair O
faster O
. O
Comparing O
this O
dryer O
to O
my O
older O
Philips O
( O
I O
moved O
so O
I O
had O
to O
leave O
it O
in O
another O
country O
) O
, O
I O
must O
note O
that O
this O
dryer O
provides O
weaker O
blow O
. O
I O
think O
it O
is O
because O
of O
much O
bigger O
output O
vent O
. O
Minus O
1 O
star O
because O
there O
is O
no O
ceramic O
heating O
element O

just O

about O
4 O

6 O
hours O

my O

I O
hate O
hair O
dryers O
though O
because O
they O
make O
my O
hair O
brittle O
and O
dry O
. O
This O

I O
'm O
glad O
to O
buy O
this O
dryer O

It O
's O

enough O
to O
dry O

hair O
in O
a O
few O
minutes O
. O

I O
am O
not O
one O
to O
buy O
an O
expensive O
hair O
dryer O
, O
but O
this O
Panasonic O

worth O
every O

surprisingly O
light O

notice O
before O

quietly O
, O
none O
of O
the O
loud O

  O
As O
I O
run O
my O
fingers O

with O
my O
lower O

For O

not O
so O
hot O
as O
to O

you O
-- O
but O
is O
very O

the O
high O
velocity O
of O
air O
it O
outputs O

This O
is O

an O

I O
absolutely O

Its O
construction O
makes O
it O
easy O
to O
handle O
regardless O
of O
which O
portion O
of O
my O
head O
I O
am O
drying O
. O
It O
also O
does O
a O
beautiful O
job O
of O
drying O
and O
subduing O
the O
texture O
of O
my O
fine O
, O
course O
4C O
hair O

I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
use O
high O

get O
the O

that O
I O
am O
loving O

loving O

Not O
powerful O
enough O
and O
not O
a O
good O
value O
for O
the O
mney O
. O

I O
have O
always O
loved O
Conair O
products O
and O
used O
them O
for O
years O
. O
I O
had O
an O
old O
Conair O
hair O
dryer O
since O
early O
2000 O
's O
and O
it O
finally O
took O
a O
dive O
. O
What O
I O
loved O
about O
my O
old O
dryer O
was O
how O
lightweight O
and O
powerful O
it O
was O
. O
I O
searched O
on O
Amazon O
for O
the O
same O
and/or O
similar O
style O
and O
came O
across O
this O
. O
The O
Conair O
1875 O
Watt O
Tourmaline O
Ceramic O
hair O
dryer O
is O
as O
good O
or O
better O
than O
the O
older O
version O
, O
which O
had O
the O
same O
wattage O
. O
It O
is O
lightweight O
, O
powerful O
, O
and O
so O
comfortable O
to O
use O
. O
The O
switches O
were O
an O
important O
part O
for O
me O
. O
I O
love O
the O
slide O
switches O
because O
you O
can O
grab O
it O
by O
the O
handle O
and O
not O
accidentally O
turn O
it O
off O
while O
you O
're O
using O
it O
. O
I O
have O
very O
long O
and O
thick O
hair O
and O
this O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
! O
If O
you O
're O
the O
type O
of O
person O
who O
does O
n't O
want O
sore O
arms O
when O
drying O
your O
hair O
, O
this O
is O
perfect O
for O
you O
! O

Good O
, O
work O
well O

I O
had O
used O
it O
once O
in O
a O
hotel O
. O
  O
I O
like O
it O
getting O
my O
hair O
dry O
as O
faster O
as O
my O
old O
one O
, O
and O
a O
big O
plus O
is O
it O
did O
n't O
sound O
loudly O
as O
my O
old O
one O
. O
  O
Yes O
, O
it O
's O
just O

that O
it O
hangs O
on O
the O
wall O
-- O
right O
where O
you O
need O
it O
. O

Not O
al O
all O
what O
I O
expected O
. O
Low O
air O
output O
. O

This O
dryer O
replaced O
my O
dryer O
of O
4 O
years O
and O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
power O
. O
I O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone O
! O

Does O
the O
job O
perfectly O
and O
fitted O
my O
hairdryer O
with O
no O
issues O
. O

This O
is O
completely O
adorable O
and O
comes O
in O
a O
zebra O
striped O
bag O
. O
  O
What O
's O
not O
to O
love O
? O
  O
Oh O

, O
great O
job O
at O
drying O
my O
hair O
as O
well O
! O

Works O
well O
and O
not O
too O
noisy O
. O

This O
item O
is O
exactly O
what O
I O
replaced O
. O
Thank O
you O

I O
was O
replacing O
this O
unit O
with O
another O
Sunbeam O
wall O
mount O
that O
my O
wife O
had O
for O
nearly O
10 O
years O
. O
When O
this O
arrived O
first O
the O
hi O
- O
low O
setting O
did O
n’t O
work O
. O
Also O
it O
is O
n’t O
hard O
wired O
so O
you O
have O
a O
cord O
dangling O
off O
the O
wall O
. O
That O
was O
my O
fault O
I O
did O
n’t O
realize O
it O
when O
I O
ordered O
it O
. O
So O
I O
returned O
it O
with O
no O
hassle O
and O
ordered O
the O
wall O
mount O
hard O
wire O
unit O
with O
three O
settings O
and O
no O
cord O
to O
tangle O
. O
A O
happy O
wife O
is O
a O
happy O
LIFE O
. O

I O
have O
had O
this O
for O
less O
than O
a O
month O
. O
I O
love O
it O
. O
But O
after O
the O
2nd O
time O
I O
used O
it O
, O
it O
started O
sending O
BLUE O
SPARKS O
out O
! O
It O
is O
the O
best O
hair O
dryer O
ever O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
afraid O
to O
use O
it O
because O
it O
might O
explode O
or O
set O
my O
hair O
on O
fire O
. O
I O
know O
there O
is O
a O
warranty O
on O
it O
. O
I O
have O
just O
emailed O
Remington O
, O
but O
have O
not O
heard O
back O
yet O
. O
I O
would O
have O
given O
this O
5 O
stars O
if O
it O
was O
n't O
SPARKING O
IN O
MY O
HAND O
! O
Hopefully O
they O
will O
send O
me O
new O
one O
. O

Received O
on O
time O
and O
as O
descried O
. O

absolutely O
Love O
It O
! O

A O
great O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
Excellent O
features O
, O
and O
very O
attractive O
. O

Fits O
great O
! O
Works O
great O
! O

so O
far O
no O
problems O
with O
it O
just O
a O
bit O
heavier O
but O
nothing O
else O
... O

This O
is O
a O
good O
little O
hair O
dryer O
. O
The O
only O
problem O
is O
the O
noise O
it O
produces O
. O
It O
sounds O
like O
a O
jet O
engine O
in O
the O
high O
mode O
. O

best O
dryer O
a O
gir O
could O
ask O
for O
.. O
this O
is O
perfect O
for O
my O
natural O
hair O

Works O
great O
. O

It O
makes O
a O
lot O
of O
noise O
, O
but O
it O
dries O
my O
whole O
hair O
in O
less O
than O
5 O
min O
. O

Space O
saver O
. O
Works O
great O

does O
its O
job O
. O
love U-quality
the O
cool U-temperature
sitting O
and O
the O
feel O
of O
it O
. O

Works B-quality
as I-quality
expected L-quality
... O
great U-quality
. O
  O
The O
individual O
heat U-temperature
/ O
fan O
speed O
controls O
are O
a O
very O
nice O
feature O
. O

this O
is O
a O
nice U-quality
dryer O
but O
I O
saw O
NO O
change O
in O
the O
time O
it O
took O
to O
dry O
or O
the O
way O
my O
hair O
felt O
and O
looked O
after O
use O
. O
Bottom O
line O
... O
Not O
worth O
the O
$ U-price
$ O
$ O

Love U-quality
this O
dryer O
. O
Best O
I O
've O
ever O
owned O
! O
Love O
how O
it O
is O
so O
quiet O
as O
well O
. O
Even O
my O
son O
said O
it O
's O
the O
best O
. O

Cute U-appearance
but O
cheaply U-price
made O
. O

Although O
I O
bought O
this O
for O
travel U-scenario
, O
I O
like O
it O
more O
then O
my O
regular O
sized O
dryer O
. O
Its O
pink O
but O
appears O
purple O
in O
the O
picture O
, O
that O
s O
the O
only O
reason O
I O
gave O
it O
a O
4 O
instead O
of O
a O
5 O
. O

Worked B-quality
fine L-quality
for O
me O

My B-quality
favorite L-quality
hair O
dryer O
over O
the O
yrs O
. O
Great O
for O
traveling O
as O
still O
find O
the O
occasional O
lodging O
without O
dryers O
. O

Good B-quality
buy L-quality

Best U-quality
that O
i O
have O
ever O
owned O
. O

Love U-quality
it O

I O
really O
do O
n't O
notice O
a O
difference O
in O
thus O
dryer O
and O
other O
dryers O
. O
My O
hair O
still O
gets O
very O
frizzy O
whIle O
drying O
and O
hard O
to O
manage O
. O
  O
then O
if O
it O
's O
humid O
out O
stays O
frizzy O
. O
My O
hair O
does O
n't O
look O
healthy O
when O
I O
use O
this O
. O
It O
takes O
me O
a O
long O
time O
to O
blow O
dry O
my O
medium O
thick O
  O
19inch O
hair O
. O
Again O
, O
  O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
all O
dryers O
would O
be O
the O
same O
for O
me O
but O
I O
mostly O
let O
it O
air O
dry O
than O
use O
this O
. O

Not O
what O
I O
expected O
. O
The O
dryer O
is O
poorly O
made O
. O
  O
The O
nozzle O
flies O
off O
about O
3 O
- O
4 O
times O
while O
I O
'm O
drying O
my O
hair O
. O
  O
It O
's O
very O
annoying U-quality
! O
  O
I O
will O
most O
likely O
return O
. O

its B-quality
okay L-quality
but O
with O
only O
2 O
heat U-temperature
control O
is O
not O
good O

So O
far O
so B-quality
good L-quality
! O

It O
's O
fairly O
compact U-appearance
and O
not O
very O
noisy O
. O
I O
would O
have O
liked O
a O
bit O
more O
air O
volume O
, O
but O
it O
's O
ok O
in O
that O
respect O
. O
The O
night O
light O
was O
too O
bright O
so O
I O
disabled O
it O
. O
If O
it O
lasts O
as O
long O
as O
my O
previous O
Andis O
, O
which O
was O
18 O
years O
, O
I O
'll O
be O
well O
satisfied O
. O

Works B-quality
perfectly L-quality
. O
Strong U-airflow
and O
compact U-appearance

Replacing O
earlier O
unit O
, O
same O
model O
. O
Found O
only O
on O
Amazon O
:) O

Excellent U-quality
, O
powerful O
motor O
and O
it O
leaves O
my O
hair O
very O
shiny O

Love U-quality
it O
- O
not O
an O
overly O
strong O
blow O
dryer O
which O
I O
like O
because O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
thick O
hair O
. O
  O
It O
's O
nice O
and O
light O
so O
my O
arm O
does O
n't O
get O
tired O
. O
  O
No O
frizz O
either O
. O

I O
love U-quality
it O
.... O

Makes O
my O
hair O
so O
smooth O
with O
no O
frizz O
! O

Good O
size U-appearance
, O
good O
power U-power
. O

I O
used O
this O
hairdryer O
for O
the O
first O
time O
at O
a O
resort O
that O
we O
were O
staying O
at O
and O
just O
loved O
it O
. O
  O
I O
loved O
the O
idea O
of O
the O
retractable O
cord O
and O
folding O
head O
, O
  O
it O
just O
seemed O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
so O
much O
easier O
and O
better O
that O
what O
I O
had O
used O
previously O
. O
  O
Before O
I O
left O
the O
resort O
I O
went O
to O
my O
computer O
and O
looked O
it O
up O
and O
was O
amazed O
at O
how O
reasonably O
priced O
it O
was O
and O
ordered O
one O
right O
then O
. O
  O
I O
highly O
recommend U-quality
this O
dryer O
! O

Excellent U-quality
..... O

very B-quality
bad L-quality
hair O
dryer O
, O
it O
stopped O
working O
soon O
. O

Good B-quality
quality L-quality

Good U-quality

I O
like U-quality
this O
hair O
dryer O
, O
it O
's O
worth O
the O
price U-price
. O
Thank B-quality
you L-quality

Excellent O
! O
Finally O
my O
hair O
is O
like O
at O
the O
hairdresser O
hahaha O

I O
liked O
this O
dryer O
a O
lot O
, O
and O
it O
was O
a O
great O
dryer O
for O
the O
price O
. O
  O
However O
, O
a O
month O
after O
the O
warranty O
expired O
it O
started O
shooting O
out O
green O
sparks O
and O
losing O
heat O
. O
  O
Probably O
wo O
n't O
bother O
with O
this O
brand O
again O
, O
as O
I O
see O
the O
same O
thing O
has O
happended O
to O
other O
users O
. O

Awesome- O
worked O
just O
like O
it O
said O
it O
would O
! O

This O
inexpensive O
blow O
dryer O
works O
great O
! O
I O
'm O
an O
African O
American O
woman O
and O
my O
hair O
is O
n't O
straight O
. O
This O
gets O
it O
there O
. O
My O
daughter O
has O
curly O
hair O
and O
this O
does O
the O
job O
on O
hers O
as O
well O
. O
I O

my O
Andis O
30975 O
/ O
HD-10L O
1600W O
Quiet O
Hangup O
Hair O
Dryer O
with O
Night O
Light O
. O
  O
That O
dryer O
broke O
after O
a O
year O
of O
use O
and O
had O
a O
disgusting O
bright O
green O
nightlight O
. O
  O
This O
Sunbeam O
is O
wonderful O
! O
  O
It O
is O
very O
powerful O
and O
super O
compact O
on O
my O
wall O
. O
  O
The O
only O
complaint O
I O
have O
is O
that O
the O
on O
/ O
off O
button O
are O
not O
on O
the O
handle O
but O
on O
the O
hanger O
. O
  O
I O
prefer O
it O
to O
be O
on O
the O
handle O
but O
that O
is O
just O
a O
personal O
preference O
. O

Light O
and O
very O
quiet O
. O

Dries O
my O
thick O
hair O
quickly O
and O
makes O
it O
really O
smooth O
! O
Awesome O
! O

Works O
great O
. O

strong O
wind O

Works O
Great O
! O

I O
NEEDED O
A O
GOOD O
BLOW O
DRYER O
BECAUSE O
I'M O
GOING O
NATURAL O
AND O
THIS O
IS O
WHAT O
I O
NEEDED O
TO O
KEEP O
MY O
HAIR O
HEALTHY.THE O
QUALITY O
IS O
NICE O
AND O
THE O
PRICE O
IS O
NICER O
. O

I O
spent O
more O
money O
on O
this O
dryer O
than O
I O
have O
any O
other O
before O
. O
Was O
it O
worth O
the O
price O
? O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
so O
. O
It O
is O
a O
decent O
dryer O
.... O
super O
fast O
drying O
... O
so O
if O
you O
have O
thick O
hair O
, O
you O
'll O
love O
it O
. O
My O
problem O
is O
I O
have O
thin O
, O
fine O
hair O
and O
I O
'd O
prefer O
a O
lower O
setting O
. O
I O
can O
use O
the O
Scalp O
setting O
but O
even O
that O
is O
a O
bit O
powerful O
. O
I O
like O
a O
lower O
setting O
to O
style O
my O
hair O
better O
. O
This O
just O
blows O
it O
in O
all O
directions O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
see O
that O
much O
difference O
to O
be O
honest O
in O
the O
end O
result O
as O
I O
get O
with O
any O
other O
dryer O
. O
I O
wo O
n't O
send O
it O
back O
... O
does O
the O
job O
but O
I O
still O
like O
my O
old O
dryer O
best O
which O
is O
no O
longer O
made O
. O

Its O
a O
hair O
dryer O
! O
Works O
fine O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
hair O
dryer O
after O
researching O
for O
more O
than O
probably O
20 O
hours O
to O
figure O
out O
which O
one O
would O
fit O
my O
needs O
, O
etc O
. O
It O
has O
been O
well O
worth O
it O
! O
My O
hair O
dries O
more O
quickly O
and O
I O
'm O
getting O
awesome O
results O
with O
my O
round O
brush O
like O
I O
usually O
get O
at O
the O
salon O
. O
I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
this O
product O
. O
Even O
though O
I O
would O
recommend O
this O

, O
I O
am O
highly O
disappointed O
to O
find O
out O
that O
buying O
through O
Amazon O
and O
a O
3rd O
party O
I O
am O
not O
covered O
by O
the O

because O
neither O
of O
the O

resellers O
of O
the O

I O
found O
this O
out O

I O
was O
completing O
the O
warranty O
form O
that O
has O

Had O
I O
known O
this O

have O
gone O

one O
of O
the O
authorized O

sites O
and O
paid O
$ O
2 O
more O
to O
have O
a O
1 O
year O

I O
am O

This O
hair O
dryer O
functions O
properly O
and O
is O
light O
enough O
to O
maneuver O
, O
but O
the O
buttons O
are O
a O
challenge O
( O
and O
I O
'm O
a O
middle O
- O
aged O
person O
) O
. O
You O
need O
to O
slide O
them O
up O
to O
manipulate O
the O
heat O
level O
and O
another O
parallel O
set O
of O
sliding O
buttons O
to O
turn O
it O
on O
. O
It O
's O
a O
struggle O
every O
day O
. O

Bought O
this O
so O
that O
my O
9 O
year O
old O
could O
begin O
drying O
her O
own O
hair O
. O
  O
She O
liked O
the O
bag O
that O
it O
came O
with O
and O
she O
has O
no O
problem O
holding O
it O
... O
the O
full O
size O
driers O
are O
a O
bit O
heavy O
for O
her O
. O
  O
If O
I O
dry O
her O
hair O
I O
still O
prefer O
the O
beastier O
full O
size O
.... O
its O
faster O

Perfect O

I O
could O
kick O
myself O
for O
throwing O
away O
my O
old O
bonnet O
hair O
dryer O
twenty O
years O
ago O
. O
  O
It O
worked O
fine O
but O
blow O
dryers O
were O
more O
efficient O
. O
  O
I O
bet O
that O
if O
I O
still O
had O
it O
, O
I O
could O
plug O
it O
in O
and O
it O
would O
work O
much O
better O
than O
this O
model O
. O
  O
This O
model O
is O
such O
poor O
quality O
I O
'm O
shocked O
that O
someone O
would O
even O
sell O
it O
! O
  O
The O
unit O
is O
ok O
( O
after O
3 O
uses O
) O
but O
the O
bonnet O
is O
so O
cheap O
that O
the O
plastic O
connector O
pulled O
away O
from O
the O
bonnet O
on O
the O
second O
use O
. O
  O
I O
suspect O
that O
the O
glue O
they O
use O
is O
not O
heat O
resistant O
and O
it O
melted O
, O
because O
it O
started O
to O
emit O
a O
chemical O
smell O
right O
before O
the O
plastic O
ring O
fell O
out O
of O
the O
bonnet O
. O
  O
Do O
yourself O
a O
favor O
and O
spend O
the O
extra O
money O
for O
a O
reputable O
manufacturer O
. O

It O
's O
a O
nice O
hair O
dryer O
. O
Dries O
hair O
good O
. O
Has O
different O
options O
to O
chose O
wether O
you O
want O
to O
dry O
it O
with O
cold O
, O
warm O
or O
hot O
air O
. O
During O
my O
life O
I O
had O
different O
kind O
of O
hair O
dryers O
, O
and O
this O
one O
is O
as O
good O
as O
my O
other O
ones O
. O
Did O
not O
really O
noticed O
the O
difference O
. O
But O
it O
does O
what O
any O
hair O
drier O
suppose O
to O
do O
. O
And O
yes O
, O
it O
's O
made O
in O
Thailand O
. O

The O
only O
negative O
reviews O
I O
read O
about O
this O
( O
and O
all O
other O
dryers O
) O
is O
that O
some O
die O
too O
early O
. O
Hopefully O
this O
one O
will O
not O
suffer O
from O
early O
death O
syndrome O
. O
It O
is O
ideal O
for O
bathrooms O
with O
limited O
counter O
space O
. O
We O
are O
extremely O
please O
with O
the O
design O
and O
the O
white O
night O
light O
is O
a O
nice O
feature O
and O
not O
too O
bright O
as O
was O
mentioned O
in O
reviews O
of O
alternative O
models O
. O
Chose O
this O
one O
after O
analyzing O
reviews O
of O
all O
models O
. O
It O
is O
a O
little O
more O
expensive O
but O
well O
worth O
it O
. O

Works O
well O
. O
Lite O
weight O
for O
travel O
or O
home O
. O

Very O
lightweight O
but O
powerful O
. O
My O
hair O
gets O
dried O
very O
quickly O
. O

Really O
nice O

. O
  O
Saw O
this O
first O

a O
prominent O
New O

good O
enough O
for O
them O
... O
' O
  O
We O

Not O

i O
had O
my O
last O
dryer O
for O
5 O
years O
and O
it O
only O
broke O
because O
i O
dropped O
it O
twice O
really O
hard O
on O
tile O
floors O
. O
It O
still O
worked O
but O
i O
could O
hear O
it O
was O
not O
doing O
well O
so O
I O
purchased O
another O
one O

If O
you O

a O
diffuser O

Bio O
Ionic O
Universal O
Diffuser O

I O
am O
very O
surprised O
to O
be O
writing O
a O
raving O
review O
about O
a O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
I O
never O
really O
gave O
much O
thought O
to O
my O
hair O
dryer O
and O
the O
potential O
damage O
it O
could O
do O
to O
my O
hair O
. O
  O
My O
last O
dryer O
( O
it O
was O
either O
a O
Clairol O
or O
Revlon O
- O
I O
threw O
it O
out O
after O
it O
starting O
throwing O
sparks O
) O
left O
my O
hair O
extremely O
dry O
after O
approximately O
two O
years O
' O
use O
. O
  O
I O
kept O
switching O
shampoos O
and O
conditioners O
, O
thinking O
that O
my O
hair O
was O
just O
changing O
and O
I O
needed O
to O
find O
a O
new O
product O
. O
  O
Turns O
out O
all O
I O
had O
to O
do O
was O
buy O
a O
new O
hair O
dryer O
! O
  O
Before O
purchasing O
this O
dryer O
, O
I O
read O
a O
few O
online O
articles O
that O
suggested O
a O
lower O
wattage O
dryer O
for O
fine O
hair O
. O
  O
That O
is O
basically O
how O
I O
ended O
up O
with O
this O
dryer O
- O
it O
was O
the O
lowest O
wattage O
dryer O
( O
besides O
a O
travel O
dryer O
) O
for O
a O
reasonable O
price O
. O
  O
I O
have O
only O
been O
using O
it O
for O
a O
few O
weeks O
now O
and O
the O
difference O
in O
the O
feel O
of O
my O
hair O
has O
been O
unbelievable O
- O
extremely O
soft O
! O
  O
In O
addition O
, O
the O
dryer O
is O
surprisingly O
quiet O
and O
dries O
my O
full O
head O
of O
hair O
in O
less O
time O
than O
my O
prior O
dryer O
. O
  O
Overall O
, O
I O
recommend O
this O
product O
. O

Excellent O
! O
will O
surely O
buy O
again O
. O
Does O
the O
job O
right O
. O

Light O
weight O
, O
not O
too O
noisy O
and O
plenty O
of O
airflow O
. O
Not O
sure O
it O
will O
last O
a O
long O
time O
, O
but O
well O
worth O
the O
cost O
. O
Bought O
two O
of O
them O
. O
Update O
since O
reviewing O
this O
, O
both O
units O
have O
failed O
in O
the O
same O
way O
, O
power O
switch O
stops O
working O
. O
Too O
bad O
, O
these O
are O
cheap O
, O
light O
weight O
, O
not O
too O
noisy O
and O
good O
airflow O
. O

great O
buy O
! O

It O
dries O
my O
hair O
so O
quick O
leaving O
is O
so O
smooth O
, O
LOVE O
IT O
! O
! O
! O

A O
good O
buy O
for O
the O
money O
. O

nunca O
recibi O
el O
producto O

me O
gustaria O
que O
me O
repusieran O
el O

Perfect O
for O
anyone O
. O
I O
use O
two O
of O
these O
in O
a O
rental O
condo O
with O
zero O
problems O
. O

Good O
hair O
dryer O
but O
kinda O
heavy O

Wonderful O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
I O
bought O
this O
one O
for O
my O
camper O
and O
after O
using O
it O
I O
put O
my O
more O
expensive O
one O
in O
the O
camper O
and O
brought O
this O
one O
in O
the O
house O
. O
It O
dries O
my O
long O
hair O
much O
faster O
and O
somehow O
leaves O
it O
less O
frizzy O
. O
  O
I O
was O
skeptical O
of O
the O
ionic O
feature O
but O
after O
using O
it O
I O
will O
not O
use O
anything O
else O
. O
  O
I O
love O
it O
! O

More O
money O
makes O
for O
a O
better O
upgrade O
. O

This O
is O
the O
only O
diffuser O
of O
this O
variety O
I O
've O
ever O
found O
that O
has O
short O
fingers O
. O
  O
Normally O
the O
fingers O
are O
so O
long O
that O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
get O
the O
heat O
close O
enough O
to O
my O
hair O
to O
not O
take O
forever O
to O
dry O
. O
  O
( O
I O
hated O
those O
long O
fingers O
when O
I O
had O
long O
hair O
, O
and O
I O
still O
hate O
them O
now O
that O
I O
have O
short O
[ O
not O
even O
to O
my O
chin O
] O
hair O
! O
) O
  O
This O
diffuser O
does O
blow O
hair O
around O
a O
bit O
more O
than O
a O
traditional O
diffuser O
( O
for O
example O
, O
the O
old O
school O
ones O
w/ O
the O
black O
foam O
- O
like O
material O
) O
, O
but O
this O
does O
n't O
bother O
me O
since O
my O
curls O
are O
uneven O
in O
texture O
and O
lend O
themselves O
to O
a O
beach O
- O
y O
, O
messy O
type O
of O
look O
. O
  O
Might O
cause O
frizz O
for O
tight O
curls O
, O
though O
. O

This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
the O
best O
anywhere O
. O
This O
is O
my O
second O
purchase O
due O
to O
one O
of O
my O
granddaughters O
breaking O
the O
previous O
one O
. O
Will O
order O
again O
in O
the O
future O
if O
need O
be O
. O

It O
is O
a O
good O
product O
if O
you O
're O
using O
small O
or O
medium O
rollers O
. O
  O
The O
bonnet O
is O
too O
small O
for O
Large O
or O
Jumbo O
rollers O
so O
I O
only O
used O
once O
and O
packed O
it O
in O
my O
closet O
for O
whenever O
I O
decide O
to O
cut O
my O
hair O
shorter O
and O
can O
use O
smaller O
rollers O
. O
  O
It O
only O
came O
with O
one O
attachment O
, O
not O
two O
like O
the O
picture O
shows O
. O
  O
I O
like O
how O
you O
can O
store O
the O
hose O
, O
bonnet O
, O
and O
power O
cord O
inside O
the O
case O
. O

Was O
easy O
to O
install O
( O
instructions O
made O
installation O
seem O
more O
complicated O
that O
it O
was O
) O
and O
works O
well O
( O
no O
louder O
than O
your O
average O
dryer O
) O
. O
  O
I O
like O
not O
having O
to O
unplug O
my O
dryer O
, O
wrap O
the O
cord O
up O
, O
and O
place O
it O
in O
a O
drawer O
. O
  O
What O
can O
I O
say O
, O
a O
minute O
saved O
is O
a O
minute O
earned O
, O
and O
I O
reclaimed O
much O
needed O
drawer O
space O
by O
replacing O
my O
old O
, O
bulky O
, O
heavyweight O
dryer O
with O
this O
wall O
mounted O
one O
. O
  O
I O
only O
wish O
I O
had O
purchased O
it O
earlier O
. O
  O
It O
is O
also O
very O
lightweight O
so O
my O
arm O
does O
n't O
get O
tired O
when O
I O
'm O
drying O
my O
hair O
. O

awesome O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O

It O
's O
really O
safe O
, O
and O
convenient O
. O
I O
could O
curl O
my O
hair O
or O
just O
dry O
it O
. O

great O

I O
love O
it O
. O
  O
It O
's O
perfect O
. O
  O
It O
actually O
works O
and O
does O
what O
it O
says O
it O
will O
. O
  O
Accurate O
temps O
and O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
temps O
. O
  O
Very O
adjustable O
. O
  O
Only O
slight O
downside O
is O
it O
requires O
a O
strong O
hand O
to O
screw O
in O
stuff O
when O
setting O
up O
otherwise O
it O
's O
wobbly O
. O

I O
found O
the O
Conair O
1875 O
Watt O
Tourmaline O
Ceramic O
Hair O
Dryer O
very O
hard O
to O
turn O
on O
, O
choose O
my O
heat O
selection O
and O
choose O
the O
intensity O
of O
the O
blower O
. O
  O
I O
think O
Conair O
should O
have O
made O
the O
ridges O
on O
the O
two O
selectors O
more O
pronounced O
. O
  O
I O
also O
found O
the O
low O
setting O
far O
too O
powerful O
to O
comfortably O
style O
my O
bangs O
. O
  O
What O
I O
do O
like O
, O
compared O
to O
other O
hair O
dryer O
makes O
is O
that O
the O
cold O
air O
button O
was O
extremely O
user O
friendly O
. O
  O
The O
dryer O
itself O
works O
just O
fine O
and O
is O
comfortable O
to O
hold O
. O

small O
, O
light O
, O
powerful O
, O
good O
amount O
of O
heat O
. O

Would O
like O
it O
to O
have O
more O
power O
but O
love O
that O
it O
is O
more O
quite O
than O
most O
! O
  O
This O
hair O
dryer O
works O
well O
and O
I O
always O
use O
it O
on O
high O
as O
anything O
lower O
is O
not O
very O
strong O
at O
all O
. O
  O
Its O
a O
great O
price O
for O
the O
quality O
. O
I O
bought O
it O
to O
replace O
one O
that O
was O
screaming O
loud O
and O
it O
is O
so O
much O
more O
quiet O
than O
my O
old O
one O
! O
I O
appreciate O
that O
it O
will O
not O
make O
me O
loose O
my O
hearing O
while O
helping O
me O
have O
a O
good O
hair O
day O
! O

Used O
this O
for O
year O
, O
still O
awesome O
! O

does O
good O

strong O
powerful O
air O
flow O
, O
dries O
hair O
quickly O
, O
nice O
compact O
size O
, O
lightweight O
. O
  O
Wish O
it O
had O
a O
better O
button O
for O
controlling O
the O
' O
shot O
of O
cool O
' O
setting O
. O

I O
've O
used O
this O
little O
guy O
daily O
for O
the O
past O
3 O
months O
and O
I O
got O
ta O
say O
I O
love O
it!My O
only O
problem O
with O
it O
is O
how O
bulky O
the O
plug O
is O
. O
I O
mean O
, O
seriously O
, O
if O
you O
want O
it O
to O
be O
a O
PORTABLE O
dryer O
, O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
end O
of O
the O
cord O
be O
almost O
as O
big O
as O
the O
handle O
. O
In O
terms O
of O
performance O
, O
however O
, O
I O
can O
not O
complain O
. O

Great O
hair O
dryer O
, O
just O
leaving O
a O
quick O
review O
to O
state O
that O
, O
like O
others O
have O
stated O
, O
the O
matte O
rubber O
covering O
on O
my O
dryer O
is O
all O
peeling O
off O
on O
the O
handle O
( O
and O
taking O
the O
words O
with O
it O
... O
) O
. O
This O
does O
n't O
affect O
the O
usability O
of O
the O
dryer O
, O
but O
it O
's O
ugly O
and O
I O
have O
to O
memorize O
all O
of O
the O
settings O
before O
they O
disappear O
. O
It O
took O
about O
a O
week O
of O
everyday O
use O
before O
mine O
started O
to O
peel O
. O
Otherwise O
, O
the O
dryer O
dries O
my O
hair O
in O
an O
expeditious O
manner O
, O
which O
is O
really O
all O
you O
can O
ask O
of O
a O
hair O
dryer O
. O
:) O

Very O
good O
! O
  O
Excellent O
. O
It O
works O
. O
I O
love O
it O
! O

Unfortunately O
I O
banned O
it O
wrong O
power O
connection O
for O
australia O

best O
dryer O
I O
've O
had O
in O
years O
! O

This O
has O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
best O
hairdryers O
I O
ve O
bought O
. O
The O
plum O
sparkle O
coloring O
is O
spectacular O
. O
It O
is O
a O
little O
heavy O
but O
not O
real O
noticeable O
. O
The O
only O
thing O
that O
erks O
me O
is O
where O
the O
buttons O
are O
. O
If O
you O
are O
use O
to O
holding O
it O
a O
certain O
way O
, O
you O
may O
have O
to O
change O
that O
. O
I O
miss O
having O
a O
rewindable O
cord O
too O
, O
but O
that O
s O
okay O
with O
me O
. O
It O
is O
great O
! O
My O
hairstylist O
even O
thinks O
so O
! O

I O
love O
it O
! O

Works O
great O
so O
far O
, O
heats O
up O
fast O
, O
and O
was O
a O
good O
price O
! O
No O
issues O
so O
far O
! O

GREAT O
FOR O
HOME O
USE O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O

Just O
what O
I O
wanted O
. O

Excellent O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
there O
are O
so O
many O
negative O
reviews O
, O
other O
than O
maybe O
operator O
error O
. O
This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
great O
, O
it O
dries O
my O
hair O
much O
faster O
than O
my O
other O
Revlon O
which O
is O
about O
3 O
years O
old O
and O
I O
love O
the O
different O
settings O
. O
I O
wash O
my O
hair O
every O
other O
day O
, O
so O
it O
does O
n't O
get O
daily O
use O
, O
but O
so O
far O
so O
good O
. O
The O
cord O
will O
only O
retract O
well O
if O
you O
have O
the O
handle O
extended O
, O
if O
you O
try O
to O
fold O
the O
handle O
and O
then O
retract O
it O
wo O
nt O
work O
. O
It O
is O
nice O
and O
compact O
to O
keep O
folded O
in O
my O
bathroom O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
say O
I O
am O
disappointed O
, O
but O
my O
last O
Conair O
was O
better O
. O
  O
However O
, O
it O
burnt O
out O
within O
a O
year O
, O
possibly O
because O
I O
dropped O
it O
, O
but O
this O
time O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
spend O
too O
much O
cash O
to O
replace O
it O
and O
that O
one O
is O
no O
longer O
available O
. O
  O
FYI O
-- O
The O
one O
I O
had O
and O
bought O
on O
Amazon O
was O
: O
  O
Conair O
213XP O
Infiniti O
Professional O
Tourmaline O
Ceramic O
Technology O
Ionic O
Styler O
, O
BlackI O
selected O
this O
one O
because O
I O
was O
so O
pleased O
with O
the O
last O
one O
. O
The O
color O
and O
functionality O
of O
this O
dryer O
are O
it O
's O
best O
features O
. O
  O
It O
probably O
makes O
a O
better O
travel O
dryer O
than O
anything O
. O
  O
It O
does O
n't O
allow O
you O
to O
adjust O
the O
temp O
( O
cool O
, O
warm O
, O
hot O
) O
, O
but O
it O
does O
have O
a O
cold O
shot O
button O
. O
  O
You O
can O
only O
choose O
High O
or O
Low O
speeds O
. O
  O
I O
totally O
missed O
those O
details O
in O
the O
online O
description O
that O
before O
my O
purchase O
. O
  O
I O
did O
watch O
the O
video O
and O
it O
is O
what O
sold O
me O
, O
but O
the O
video O
makes O
this O
dryer O
look O
more O
powerful O
than O
it O
really O
is O
. O
  O
Perhaps O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
thick O
hair O
like O
me O
it O
would O
perform O
more O
to O
my O
liking O
. O
In O
my O
opinion O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
is O
even O
close O
to O
salon O
performance O
. O
  O
It O
says O
it O
uses O
ion O
technology O
, O
but O
my O
last O
Conair O
that O
was O
labeled O
ionic O
worked O
so O
much O
better O
and O
dried O
my O
hair O
faster O
with O
hardly O
any O
frizz O
. O
  O
This O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
, O
It O
dries O
my O
hair O
pretty O
fast O
, O
but O
my O
hair O
is O
very O
frizzy O
after O
which O
annoys O
me O
. O
  O
I O
will O
probably O
take O
the O
plunge O
and O
buy O
a O
higher O
- O
end O
hair O
dryer O
in O
the O
future O
, O
until O
then O
, O
this O
is O
OK O
and O
will O
get O
me O
through O
! O

Blow O
dryer O
is O
awesome O
! O
  O
Works O
great O

On O
high O
heat O
dryer O
blows O
hair O
so O
hard O
you O
can O
not O
style O
the O
hair O
, O
it O
just O
frizzes O
. O
On O
medium O
heat O
the O
dryer O
does O
n't O
get O
hot O
enough O
when O
styling O
. O
It O
takes O
forever O
to O
dry O
on O
medium O
. O
In O
my O
opinion O
this O
unit O
is O
best O
as O
a O
blow O
dryer O
, O
not O
a O
styler O
. O

Excellent O
product O
. O
Light O
, O
powerful O
and O
practical O
. O

I O
had O
been O
using O
something O
similar O
for O
years O
. O
  O
It O
had O
belonged O
to O
my O
95 O
year O
old O
mother O
and O
lasted O
through O
her O
life O
and O
most O
of O
mine O
and O
one O
morning O
I O
turned O
it O
on O
and O
zilch O
, O
it O
had O
died O
. O
  O
Since O
I O
am O
pretty O
much O
housebound O
I O
wondered O
what O
to O
do O
next O
. O
  O
Good O
ole O
amazon O
came O
to O
the O
rescue O
. O
  O
It O
arrived O
much O
sooner O
than O
originally O
planned O
and O
I O
was O
delighted O
. O
  O
The O
equipment O
works O
extremely O
well O
with O
various O
speeds O
and O
protective O
gear O
for O
a O
bathroom O
switch O
. O
  O
The O
only O
fault O
I O
found O
was O
that O
there O
were O
other O
pieces O
for O
directing O
air O
flow O
that O
came O
with O
no O
explanation O
of O
how O
to O
connect O
them O
. O
  O
I O
do O
n't O
use O
them O
anyway O
but O
it O
would O
have O
been O
nice O
to O
have O
had O
some O
directions O
especially O
for O
the O
mechanically O
impaired O
like O
myself O
. O
  O
Otherwise O
a O
wonderful O
hair O
dryer O
for O
a O
cheap O
price O
. O

Great O
hair O
dryer O
, O
gets O
your O
hair O
dry O
in O
no O
time O
and O
the O
cord O
  O
gets O
store O
in O
the O
same O
dryer O
, O
my O
daughter O
loves O
it O
, O
thanks O
a O
lot O
! O
! O

good O
, O
very O
strong O
wind O

Good O
deal O

great O
value O
. O
  O
not O
a O
professional O
one O
, O
but O
great O
for O
home O
use O
. O

I O
have O
purchased O
this O
blow O
dryer O
more O
than O
once O
over O
the O
years O
and O
I O
like O
the O
way O
it O
works O

I O
love O
this O
dryer O
. O
Keeps O
countertop O
de O
- O
cluttered O
and O
right O
at O
hands O
reach O
. O
I O
Was O
used O
to O
more O
air O
pressure O
but O
have O
adjusted O
to O
it O
. O
My O
sister O
also O
bought O
one O
and O
loves O
it O
. O

This O
item O
works O
well O
. O
Although O
the O
medium O
and O
high O
settings O
seem O
to O
be O
the O
same O
. O
But O
it O
did O
n't O
really O
bother O
my O
because O
i O
was O
trying O
not O
to O
use O
it O
on O
such O
a O
high O
setting O
anyway O
to O
prevent O
damage O
.. O
my O
only O
complaint O
is O
that O
i O
wanted O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
using O
the O
cool O
button O
, O
i O
found O
that O
pressing O
it O
made O
my O
hand O
hurt O
, O
it O
was O
n't O
easy O
to O
hold O
down O
, O
felt O
like O
i O
was O
getting O
a O
cramp O
. O
And O
depending O
on O
what O
product O
you O
have O
in O
my O
your O
hair O
the O
whole O
dryer O
might O
slide O
from O
your O
hand O
. O
Other O
that O
that O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
good O
product O
, O
it O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
, O
and O
does O
n't O
feel O
wimpy O
in O
the O
hand O
.. O
if O
you O
have O
curly O
or O
corse O
hair O
then O
you O
wo O
n't O
find O
the O
brush O
attachment O
helpful O
. O

I O
like O
it O
. O
Not O
to O
noisy O
. O
Not O
to O
heavy O
. O

Love O
it O
so O
far O
. O
Very O
strong O
blowing O
unlike O
some O
of O
the O
other O
dryers O
I O
've O
owned O
. O

Dryer O
itself O
works O
fine O
, O
but O
The O
on O
off O
and O
temperature O
switches O
are O
poorly O
designed O
and O
hard O
to O
use O
. O
  O
If O
my O
hands O
are O
wet O
or O
have O
hair O
products O
on O
them O
I O
ca O
n't O
adjust O
them O
at O
all O
. O

The O
cord O
does O
not O
retract O
very O
well O
. O

I O
have O
a O
few O
of O
these O
for O
different O
rooms O
. O
Works O
well O
and O
cord O
retractor O
makes O
cleaning O
easy O
. O

Good O
product O
for O
it O
's O
price O
. O

I O
think O
I O
should O
give O
this O
hairdryer O
a O
five O
star O
cuz O
for O
the O
price O
and O
the O
size O
, O
it O
's O
definitely O
a O
satisfactory O
for O
me O
. O
Would O
be O
perfect O
if O
it O
could O
bent O
but O
what O
the O
heck O
. O
It O
does O
the O
job O
really O
good O
with O
1200W. O
The O
nozzle O
of O
course O
helps O
a O
lot O
. O
I O
got O
the O
older O
blue O
Conair O
travel O
hairdryer O
, O
ca O
n't O

Powerful O

Great O
Buy O

just O
ok O

I O
am O
not O
a O
salon O
styilst O
, O
just O
someone O
who O
likes O
to O
dry O
her O
hair O
at O
home O
at O
anytime O
, O
even O
at O
midnight O
if O
it O
is O
when O
the O
time O
is O
available O
. O
I O
used O
to O
go O
to O
a O
beaty O
salon O
to O
have O
my O
hair O
dry O
. O
It O
took O
usually O
45 O
- O
50 O
minutes O
for O
my O
stylist O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
, O
which O
is O
just O
not O
long O
, O
thick O
and O
wavy O
: O
I O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
it O
, O
too O
( O
my O
stylist O
used O
to O
joke O
saying O
I O
had O
to O
heads O
in O
one O
, O
but O
sometimes O
another O
stylist O
would O
come O
to O
give O
her O
a O
hand O
... O
imagine O
to O
people O
pulling O
at O
your O
hair O
at O
the O
same O
time O
... O
it O
felt O
as O
if O
they O
were O
trying O
to O
split O
my O
head O
in O
two O
, O
sometimes O
! O
) O
. O
My O
stylist O
is O
great O
, O
and O
became O
my O
great O
friend O
, O
but O
no O
matter O
how O
well O
she O
treated O
my O
hair O
, O
and O
how O
many O
conditioners O
, O
etc O
. O
I O
used O
, O
my O
hair O
got O
scorched O
enough O
that O
a O
some O
of O
it O
was O
always O
breaking O
in O
half O
, O
the O
natural O
waviness O
lost O
in O
an O
ugly O
way O
( O
the O
half O
of O
the O
hair O
closest O
to O
the O
roots O
, O
the O
other O
half O
wavy O
still O
... O
When O
I O
had O
my O
hair O
wet O
, O
it O
looked O
weird).One O
day O
I O
decided O
to O
get O
myself O
a O
blowdryer O
, O
and O
got O
the O
FHI O
2000 O
. O
Which O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
great O
, O
and O
while O
drying O
my O
hair O
with O
difficulty O
at O
first O
, O
because O
of O
my O
lack O
of O
practice O
, O
I O
managed O
. O
Seating O
in O
front O
of O
a O
mirror O
, O
I O
would O
bravely O
spent O
1 O
hour O
drying O
my O
hair O
. O
It O
was O
worth O
it O
! O
My O
hair O
changed O
a O
lot O
, O
and O
the O
huge O
amounts O
of O
money O
I O
used O
to O
spend O
at O
the O
beaty O
salon O
were O
no O
longer O
necessary O
. O
Once O
I O
encountered O
my O
former O
stylist O
in O
the O
supermarket O
, O
and O
she O
thought O
I O
was O
visiting O
another O
beauty O
salon O
, O
she O
did O
n't O
believe O
me O
when O
I O
told O
her O
it O
was O
me O
( O
she O
did O
nt O
tell O
me O
, O
but O
from O
her O
face O
I O
could O
tell O
she O
did O
nt O
believe O
me).After O
a O
bit O
more O
than O
3 O
years O
, O
my O
FHi O
dryer O
fell O
to O
the O
floor O
and O
the O
little O
fan O
inside O
broke O
. O
I O
strongly O
advise O
you O
not O
to O
attempt O
repair O
with O
any O
other O
generic O
piece O
of O
whatever O
that O
is O
not O
original O
or O
not O
from O
the O
FHI O
repair O
service O
( O
if O
they O
have O
any O
, O
I O
do O
nt O
know O
, O
because O
I O
live O
in O
the O
Caribbean O
) O
. O
I O
did O
that O
, O
and O
regretted O
it O
a O
lot O
, O
since O
the O
repaired O
dryer O
damaged O
my O
hair O
. O
I O
had O
to O
condition O
it O
lots O
and O
lots O
afterwards O
, O
but O
I O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
my O
hair O
to O
outgrow O
the O
damage O
( O
grrr!).Then O
I O
decided O
to O
get O
myself O
a O
nice O
, O
professional O

drier O

fast O

, O
I O
can O
not O
stop O
myself O
from O
congratulating O
me O
for O
my O
accurate O
decision O

My O

tried O
it O
( O
she O
has O
wavy O

think O
hair O

immediately O

it O

frizzy O
after O

Not O

better O

  O
Someone O

and O
dries O
really O
quickly O

nicely O

love O
the O

It O
's O
really O
light O

very O
quiet O

dispenses O
a O
small O
burst O
of O
cool O
air O
from O
above O
the O
nuzzle O
, O
which O
is O
unexpectedly O
brilliant O
. O
It O

it O
does O

take O
too O
much O
space O
in O
my O

fine O

It O
was O
a O
nice O
hair O
dryer O
, O
came O
highly O
recommended O
by O
several O
sites O
. O
Unfortunately O
, O
it O
only O
lasted O
about O
10 O
uses O
before O
the O
power O
began O
to O
surge O
and O
there O
was O
a O
distinct O
ozone O
odor O
coming O
from O
it O
. O
For O
safety O
I O
shut O
it O
off O
immediately O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
use O
a O
hair O
dryer O
that O
often O
, O
so O
I O
had O
already O
had O
it O
past O
the O
time O
I O
could O
return O
it O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
mine O
was O
a O
dud O
or O
not O
or O
if O
it O
perhaps O
was O
damaged O
some O
way O
in O
shipping O
, O
but O
I O
hesitate O
to O
buy O
the O
same O
model O
. O
It O
was O
to O
replace O
a O
dryer O
that O
had O
lasted O
me O
over O
10 O
years O
, O
so O
I O
am O
very O
disappointed O
. O

This O
hairdryer O
makes O
my O
hair O
look O
fabulous O
! O
I O
did O
n't O
think O
that O
it O
would O
make O
much O
difference O
, O
but O
it O
did O
! O
! O

best O
hair O
dryer O
ever O
! O
! O
! O
! O
i O
did O
nt O
care O
that O
much O
abt O
a O
hair O
dryer O
so O
most O
of O
time O
my O
hair O
was O
fuzzy O
. O
this O
hair O
dryer O
really O
works O
with O
its O
function O
choices O
. O

So O
far O
so O
good O
! O
  O
The O
dryer O
is O
very O
lightweight O
, O
which O
I O
love O
. O
  O
Love O
the O
pink O
too O
! O
  O
The O
price O
was O
right O
as O
well O
--- O
all O
around O
a O
good O
purchase O
! O

as O
advertised O

Has O
no O
power O
. O
  O
Thought O
I O
would O
spend O
more O
and O
get O
a O
dryer O
that O
was O
better O
but O
it O
was O
not O
worth O
it O
. O
Makes O
a O
horrible O
whine O
sound O
when O
I O
use O
it O
and O
takes O
a O
long O
time O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O

Used O
this O
at O
one O
of O
top O
brand O

Hotel O
, O
Like O
it O
very O

Excellent B-quality

So O
hot U-temperature
I O
could O
n’t O
use O
it O
except O
to O
thaw O
ice O
in O
my O
freezer O
. O

this O
dryer O
did O
not O
blow O
with O
much O
power U-power
, O
I O
returned B-quality
it L-quality
. O

I O
'm O
sorry O
that O
I O
have O
rate O
this O
product O
3 B-quality
stars L-quality
without O
trying O
it O
out O
but O
I O
would O
like O
to O
share O
what O
happened O
with O
this O
item O
. O
I O
received O
this O
package O
today O
and O
was O
really O
excited O
about O
it O
. O
When O
I O
opened O
the O
box O
I O
saw O
at O
least O
4 O
small O
bugs O
crawling O
around O
in O
it O
. O
This O
was O
enough O
to O
make O
me O
immediately O
close O
the O
box O
and O
bring O
it O
outside O
my O
house O
. O
As O
for O
the O
product O
, O
it O
looks O
great O
and O
as O
pictured O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
get O
a O
chance O
to O
try O
it O
because O
I O
am O
sending O
it O
back O
to O
Amazon O
tomorrow O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
believe O
that O
this O
pest O
issue O
would O
be O
from O
the O
product O
so O
I O
think O
it O
must O
have O
happened O
in O
the O
warehouse O
/ O
packaging O
stage O
. O
I O
'm O
disappointed O
that O
I O
did O
n't O
get O
a O
chance O
to O
try O
this O
blowdryer O
but O
I O
will O
not O
be O
ordering O
another O
one O
for O
fear O
of O
the O
same O
thing O
happening O
again O
. O

Works B-quality
well L-quality
but O
both O
of O
us O
frequently O
turn O
of O
the O
hair O
dryer O
by O
accident O
because O
of O
knob O
placement O
.. O

First O
  O
Introduced O
to O
this O

be O

it O
is O
. O
  O
One O
has O
lasted O
5 O

The O

I O
purchased O
in O
June O
has O
burned O
up O

has O
to O
be O
replaced O

It O
was O
great U-quality
while O
it O
was O
working O
and O
wife O
loved U-quality
it O
but O
surely O
it O
should O
have O
lasted O
more O
than O
3 O
1/2 O
months O
. O

This O
brand O
was O
recommended U-quality
by O
my O
hair O
stylist O
. O
  O
It O
is O
perfect U-quality
to O
straighten O
hair O
; O
however O
, O
for O
soft O
curly O
hair O
such O
as O
mine O
, O
the O
heat O
is O
too O
strong O
even O
at O
low O
level O
. O
  O
I O
have O
to O
use O
the O
old O
hair O
drying O
when O
diffusing O
my O
hair O
. O
  O
My O
daughters O
, O
who O
happened O
to O
have O
mixed O
hair O
, O
love O
this O
hair O
drying O
because O
it O
straightens O
it O
fast O
and O
without O
drying O
it O
. O

this O
dryer O
was O

I O

If O

really O
coarse O
hair O
be O
careful O
with O

they O

a O

The O
down O
sides O
are O
the O
large O

it O
being O

heavy O
and O
needs O
both O
hands O
to O
maneuver O
. O
The O
other O
odd O
thing O
is O
that O
when O
using O
the O

a O
small O
clump O
of O
hair O
gets O
pulled O
up O
to O
the O

At O

turned B-appearance
pink L-appearance
within O
about O
2 O
weeks O
of O
using O
it O

I O
loved U-quality
it O

after O
8 O
months O

The O
blow O
dryer O
is O
awesome U-quality
however O
the O

fall O
off O
when O
trying O
to O

. O
We O
had O
to O
bond O
the O
comb B-attachment

to O
the O
unit O
n O

great U-quality
for B-price
the I-price
price L-price

i B-expectation
needed L-expectation
a O
slightly O
more O
powerful U-power

for O
my O
thick O

but O
no O
complaints O

again O

Very B-usability
light L-usability
& O
dries O
hair O
quickly U-dryingspeed
without O
frizz U-noisy
. O

Within O
nine O
months O
of O
purchase O
this O
hair O
dryer O
stopped B-quality
working L-quality
- O
overheats U-temperature
within O
minutes O
. O
  O
I O
do O
n't O
even O
dry O
my O
hair O
but O
a O
few O
times O
a O
month O
so O
this O
is O
not B-quality
the I-quality
best I-quality
purchase L-quality
. O

Nice B-quality
one L-quality
..... O

Quiet U-noisy
and O
fairly B-usability
light L-usability
. O
dries B-quality
nicely L-quality
without B-quality
scorching L-quality
. O
The O
pink B-appearance
hue L-appearance
on O
the O
buttons U-appearance
and O
filter B-attachment
housing L-attachment
was O
a B-quality
surprise L-quality
, O
as O
it O
did O
n't O
really O
show O
up O
in O
the O
photo O
, O
but O
, O
hey O
, O
it O
's O
just O
a O
hair O
dryer O
. O

I O
have O
long O
hair O
, O
and O
for B-price
the I-price
price L-price
, O
it O
does B-quality
a I-quality
good I-quality
job L-quality
. O
The O
only O
drawback U-quality
is O
that O
I O
feel B-comfort
the I-comfort
vibration L-comfort
more O
so O
than O
from O
other O
hair O
dryers O
. O
Worth U-quality
what O
it B-price
cost L-price
though O
. O

Perfect U-quality
. O

This O
is O
worth B-price
the I-price
money L-price
. O
  O
Do O
n't O
waste O
your O
money U-price
on O
the O
cheap U-price
ones O
, O
spend O
a O
little O
extra O
and O
get O
one O
like O
this O
that O
is O
good U-quality
for O
your O
hair O
. O

Does O
n't O
get O
very B-temperature
hot L-temperature
, O
take B-dryingspeed
longer L-dryingspeed
to O
dry O
hair O

Easy B-usability
mounting L-usability
but O
very B-power
little I-power
power L-power
. O
I O
recommend U-quality
you O
get O
one O
that O
has O
1800 B-power
or I-power
more I-power
watts L-power
. O

I O
loved U-quality
this O
dryer O
. O
It O
is O
super B-usability
light L-usability
, O
small U-appearance
and O
super B-power
powerful L-power
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O
It O
is O
very B-airflow
strong L-airflow
and O
drys O
very B-dryingspeed
fast L-dryingspeed
. O
excellent B-quality
product L-quality
, O
I O
completely B-quality
recommend L-quality
. O

My O
wife O

a O
big B-quality

nearly O

down L-quality
the O

3 O
times O
already O
. O

Powerful U-power
, O
well B-appearance

the I-price
money L-price

My O
Elchim O
from O
the O
90s O
finally O
died O
and O
it O
was O
like O
a O
death O
in O
the O
family O
. O
  O
My O
hair O
, O
while O
I O
used O
a O
temporary O
hair O
dryer O
was O
atrocious O
with O
frizz O
and O
stray O
hairs O
everywhere O
. O
  O
This O
Elchim O
showed O
up O
and O
it O
was O
like B-quality
a I-quality
miracle L-quality
. O
  O
The O
hair O
dryer O
is O
just O
amazing U-quality
. O
  O
I O
read O
some O
of O
the O
reviews O
and O
there O
was O
a O
burning B-quality
smell L-quality
for O
the O
1st O
and O
maybe O
2nd O
time O
I O
used O
it O
, O
but O
never O
again O
. O
  O
It O
leaves O
your O
hair O
silky O
smooth!Oh O
and O
regarding O
the O
heaviness U-usability
... O
don't O
judge O
a O
book O
by O
its O
cover U-appearance
. O
  O
It O
is O
heavy U-usability
until O
you O
use O
it O
. O
  O
Then O
magically O
the O
weight U-usability
is O
distributed O
nicely U-quality
. O
  O
Do O
n't O
ask O
me O
how O
... O
some O
kudos O
go O
to O
the O
designers O
! O

Do B-quality
n't I-quality
believe L-quality
the O
High B-dryingspeed
- I-dryingspeed
velocity L-dryingspeed
airflow U-airflow
statement O
- O
this O
hair O
dryer O
only O
had O
a O
low B-dryingspeed
& I-dryingspeed
medium I-dryingspeed
setting L-dryingspeed
. O
  O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
what O
people O
would O
call O
a O
thick O
head O
of O
hair O
and O
it O
took B-dryingspeed
a I-dryingspeed
long I-dryingspeed
time L-dryingspeed
for O
me O
to O
dry O
what O
I O
have O
. O
  O
The O
hair B-attachment
brush L-attachment
was O
flimsy O
and O
the O
bristles U-attachment
were O
mangled U-quality
when O
I O
received O
it O
. O
  O
Another O
thing O
I O
did B-quality
n't I-quality
like L-quality
was O
that O
it O
is O
quite B-usability
heavy L-usability
and O
the O
handle U-attachment
is O
long U-appearance
so O
it O
makes O
it O
seem O
even B-usability
heavier L-usability
when O
you O
are O
holding O
it O
. O
  O
I O
ended O
up O
returning O
it O
since O
it O
was O
pretty B-quality
useless L-quality
to O
to O
. O

Hair O
dryer O
blew B-quality
up L-quality
the O
third O
time O
I O
used O
it O
! O

I O
liked U-quality
it O
when O
it B-quality
worked L-quality
, O
but O
now O
it O
does O
n't O
have O
very B-power
much I-power
power L-power
. O

Very B-quality
disappointment L-quality
. O
I O
should U-expectation
have O
read O
the O
reviewer O
before O
I O
brought O
this O
dryer O
. O
Because O
of O
the B-price
price L-price
it O
caught O
my O
attention O
. O
but O
it B-quality
does I-quality
n't L-quality
dry O
the O
back O
of O
the O
hair O
. O
Terrible B-quality
designing L-quality
! O
! O
  O
That O
all O
I O
have O
to O
say O
. O

with O
one O
arm O
cut O
off O
due O
to O
and O
accident O
it O
does B-quality
the I-quality
job L-quality

This O
little U-appearance
dryer O
is O
my O
favorite U-quality
. O

Had O
a O
hard O

. O
Yes O

great L-quality
.. O
donated O
it O
to O
my O

this O
software B-attachment
bonnet L-attachment
puts O
the O
heat U-temperature
in O
all O
the O
right O
areas O
of O
your O
head O
. O
Light B-usability

Good U-quality

such O
a O
great B-quality
quality I-quality
product L-quality
for O
a B-price
great I-price

. O
I O
was O
in O
the O
market O
for O
a O
new O

could B-price
n't I-price

to O
spend O
an O

and O
a O
leg O
on O
a O
fancy O
blow O

I O
did O
a O

came O
across O
this O

was O
worried O
that O
for B-price
the I-price

the O

would O
n't O
be O
as O
described O

it O
has O
3 O
different O
heat B-temperature
settings L-temperature
and O
two O
different B-dryingspeed
levels L-dryingspeed

dryer O
is O
still O
going B-quality

If O
you O

in O
the O
market O
for O
a O
new O

have O
had O
this O

for O
almost O

  O
If O
I O

nearly O
caught O
my O

fire L-quality
. O
  O
It O
was O
like O
a O
torch U-quality

  O
This O

so O
hazardous U-quality
! O

I O

blow O
dryer O
and O
be O
able O
to O

of O
research O
for O
a O
good B-quality
quality L-quality
inexpensive U-price
blow O
dryer O
with O
enough O
settings U-attachment
. O
Especially O
because O
I O
have O
fine O
hair O
, O
a O
blow O
dryer O
that O
does O
n't O
get O
extremely B-temperature
hot L-temperature
was O
a O
priority O
. O
I O
absolutely O
love U-quality

everything O
that O

a O
good O
amount O
of O

Very B-quality
nice L-quality

. O

I O
absolutely B-quality

. O
It O
looks O
like O
I O
came O
out O
of O
salon O
everytime O
. O

Works B-quality
great L-quality
! O

This O
dries O
my O
hair O
faster U-dryingspeed
that O
bigger U-appearance
, O
more O
powerful U-power
models O
. O
I O
love O
travel U-scenario
blow O
dryers O
because O
they O
are O
easy B-usability
to I-usability
lift L-usability
and O
they O
usually O
come O
in O
1600 B-power
w L-power
or O
less O
. O
Bigger U-appearance
dryers O
are O
heavy U-usability
and O
blow O
my O
hair O
everywhere O
. O
This O
has O
a O
surprising O
amount O
of O
power U-power
and O
is O
very O
compact U-appearance
. O
I O
would O
give O
it O
a O
five O
except O
that O
the O
switch U-usability
is O
not O
easy B-usability
to I-usability
turn L-usability
on O
and O
off O
with O
one O
hand O
and O
it O
's O
noisier U-noisy
than O
I O
anticipated O
. O

Love U-quality
this O
dryer O
! O

styling O
hair O
in O
style O

I O
just O
got O
this O
last O
week O
. O
I O
think O
's O
great O
. O
The O
cord O
length O
is O
perfect O
. O

Excellent O
dryer O
. O

Gets O
extremely O
hot O
- O
I O
have O
burned O
my O
hand O
on O
both O
the O
metal O
grate O
as O
well O
as O
the O
plastic O
body O
. O
After O
use O
I O
have O
to O
keep O
on O
the O
counter O
because O
it O
is O
too O
hot O
to O
put O
away O
. O
It O
has O
melted O
2 O
different O
combs O
and O
now O
starts O
to O
smoke O
during O
use O
. O
My O
hair O
requires O
high O
heat O
to O
dry O
completely O
and O
not O
be O
frizzy O
, O
but O
this O
is O
unsafe O
and O
ridiculous O
. O
As O
soon O
as O
my O
new O
model O
arrives O
( O
not O
this O
brand O
) O
this O
is O
going O
in O
the O
trash O
! O

I O
found O
everything O
goes O
well O
except O
the O
plug O
. O
Why O
the O
left O
and O
right O
is O
opposite O
and O
I O
have O
to O
put O
the O
plug O
upside O
down O
for O
charging O
! O
! O
! O
Another O
flaw O
is O
the O
big O
noise O
. O

Perfect O

I O
really O
like O
this O
hairdryer O
. O
I O
have O
n't O
had O
it O
very O
long O
. O
But O
it O
's O
working O
well O
for O
me O
. O

Got O
tho O
on O
super O
sale O
. O
Love O
it O
! O
Cuts O
my O
drying O
time O
in O
half O

Reckon O
I O
have O
had O
this O
about O
a O
year O

5 O
days O
a O
week O

does O
nt O
overheat O
, O
is O
nt O
to O
big O
, O
came O
quick O
, O
did O
nt O
cost O
much O
. O
Get O
you O
one O
, O
you O
will O
like O
it O
. O

The O
styling O
tip O
does O
not O
stay O
on O
, O
keeps O
falling O
off O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
blow O
drying O
and O
then O
it O
's O

Nice O

Great O

my O
clients O

power O

Great O
deal O
... O
N O
it O
's O
super O
cute O
... O
   O
Update O
: O
7 O
- O
8?months O
later O
it O
only O
blows O
cold O
air O
. O
I O
would O
n't O
recommend O
this O
drier O
for O
the O
price O
they O
are O
selling O
it O
now O
. O
It O
's O
rubbish O

Like O
this O
as O
well O
as O
the O
one O
I O
had O
before O
. O

Very O
quiet O
. O
Bought O
this O
to O
replace O
my O
girlfriend O
's O
stupid O
loud O
blow O
dryer O
that O
woke O
me O
up O
every O
morning O
. O
This O
thing O
is O
much O
easier O
on O
the O
ears O
. O

this O
is O
a O
good O
dryer O
with O
nice O
attachments O
... O
very O
light O
and O
powerful O
. O
The O
only O
drawback O
is O
the O
switches O
. O
If O
your O
hand O
has O
any O
mousse O
or O
oil O
on O
them O
, O
forget O
turning O
this O
on O
without O
a O
struggle O
. O
The O
switches O
have O
no O
grip O
nor O
heavy O
grooves O
on O
them O
that O
make O
turning O
on O
/ O
off O
easy O
. O
But O
, O
overall O
good O
. O

Live O
this O
hairdryer O

Perfect O
for O
travel O
. O

thanks O

I O
've O
had O
this O
blow O
dryer O
for O
just O
over O
a O
year O
, O
and O
it O
finally O
started O
smoking O
and O
sparking O
so O
bad O
, O
I O
believe O
it O
would O
have O
caught O
on O
fire O
if O
I O
did O
n't O
turn O
it O
off O
. O
  O
For O
the O
last O
6months O
, O
if O
not O
longer O
, O
  O
I O
've O
noticed O
that O
when O
I O
1st O
turn O
it O
on O
it O
smells O
really O
hot O
and O
the O
air O
flow O
is O
very O
low O
. O
  O
But O
after O
fiddling O
with O
the O
heat O
controls O
and O
the O
cool O
button O
it O
will O
gradually O
begin O
to O
blow O
at O
the O
normal O
flow O
. O
  O
I O
've O
used O
cheaper O
blow O
dryers O
in O
the O
past O
that O
I O
get O
a O
minimum O
of O
3 O
- O
5 O
yrs O
out O
of O
! O
! O
! O
! O
  O
I'ts O
the O
weekend O
and O
Andis O
is O
closed O
, O
but O
I O
'll O
attempt O
to O
contact O
them O
to O
see O
if O
there O
is O
anything O
that O
they O
are O
willing O
to O
do O
, O
refund O
/ O
repair O
or O
even O
replace O
this O
unit O
. O
  O
Please O
note O
that O
on O
their O
website O
over O
half O
of O
their O
blow O
dryers O
seem O
to O
be O
discontinued O
, O
hmm O
wonder O
why O
. O
I O
'll O
update O
my O
review O
once O
I O
hear O
, O
or O
do O
n't O
hear O
back O
from O
this O
company O
. O

So O
handy O
, O
works O
great O
, O
frees O
up O
counter O
top O
space O
in O
my O
small O
bathroom O
. O

After O
using O
the O
same O
blowdryer O
for O
probably O
8 O
- O
10years O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
upgrade O
to O
a O
new O
one O
. O
I O
have O
very O
thick O
( O
* O
VERY O
THICK O
! O
* O
) O
moderately O
wavy O
shoulder O
length O
hair O
. O
Due O
to O
my O
hair O
thickness O
, O
drying O
times O
were O
typically O
30 O
- O
45minutes O
. O
I O
wish O
I O
was O
joking O
. O
This O
dryer O
dries O
completely O
in O
under O
15 O
minutes O
( O
about O
10 O
- O
12minutes O
more O
precisely O
) O
. O
I O
am O
so O
thrilled O
with O
this O
dryer O
! O
! O
Ca O
n't O
say O
enough O
good O
things O
about O
it O
! O
I O
like O
the O
texture O
of O
the O
dryer O
itself O
, O
love O
the O
speed O
of O
drying O
and O
the O
cord O
is O
long O
enough O
to O
actually O
be O
able O
to O
use O
it O
! O
SCORE O
! O

Works O
great O
. O
  O
Just O
wish O
it O
had O
a O
medium O
setting O
. O

I O
blowdry O
my O
hair O
at O
least O
3 O
times O
a O
week O
and O
I O
was O
using O
a O
really O
, O
really O
old O
, O
cheap O
, O
bulky O
one O
to O
get O
the O
job O
done O
. O
This O
dryer O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
a O
lot O
better O
! O
It O
's O
smaller O
, O
lighter O
, O
more O
ergonomic O
if O
you O
will O
, O
and O
dries O
my O
long O
, O
thick O
hair O
( O
not O
always O
a O
good O
thing O
! O
) O
reasonably O
quick O
! O
Great O
purchase O
, O
as O
long O
as O
it O
lasts O
as O
long O
as O
my O
old O
ones O
did O
:) O

Love O
this O
, O
keeps O
my O
curls O
nice O
and O
not O
frizzes O
out O
. O

Bonnet O
is O
too O
small O

This O
is O
a O
really O
nice O
hair O
dryer O
from O
Remington O
. O
The O
handle O
and O
controls O
  O
are O
very O
ergonomic O
, O
and O
the O
head O
is O
well O
balanced O
so O
that O
it O
does O
n't O
get O
to O
be O
a O
chore O
handling O
it O
. O
The O
heat O
settings O
are O
what O
you O
'd O
expect O
, O
and O
the O
dryer O
does O
a O
good O
job O
of O
getting O
your O
hair O
dry O
fast O
without O
too O
much O
static O
buildup O
. O
What O
I O
really O
like O
about O
this O
dryer O
is O
the O
generous O
cord O
length O
and O
the O
ability O
to O
hand O
the O
dryer O
from O
a O
hook O
. O
The O
attachments O
fit O
well O
, O
but O
the O
diffuser O
attachment O
comes O
in O
the O
handiest O
as O
always O
. O

Great O
blowdryer O
. O
it O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
. O
the O
only O
thing O
i O
dislike O
is O
how O
it O
is O
not O
compatible O
with O
universal O
comb O
attachments O
. O
also O
as O
i O
blowdry O
my O
hair O
the O
attachment O
keeps O
falling O
off O

Amazing O
amount O
of O
air O
that O
comes O
out O
of O
it O
! O
My O
wife O
and O
I O
love U-quality
it O
... O
My O
waiting O
time O
to O
go O
out O
is O
cut O
in O
more O
than O
half O
! O
! O
Highly O
recommended U-quality
. O
Feels O
solid O
like O
you O
are O
getting O
your O
money O
's O
worth O
. O
Has O
a O
nice O
long O
cord U-attachment
too O
.. O

So O
far O
, O
an O
excellent U-quality
hair O
dryer O
. O
Not O
too O
noisy U-noisy
. O
Good O
controls O
. O
The O
handle U-attachment
is O
well O
contoured O
. O
My O
only O
nit O
is O
that O
the O
little O
plastic O
attachment O
that O
directs O
the O
stream O
of O
warm O
or O
hot O

pops O
off O
a O
little O

easily O

This O
item O
it O
's O
been O
working O
perfectly O
fine O
, O
I O
'm O
glad O
i O
ordered O
! O
! O

It O
is O
so O
hard O
to O
find O
a O
small U-appearance
blowdryer O
. O
I O
'm O
very O
happy U-quality
with O
this O
! O

Perfect U-quality

Great U-quality
dryer O
. O

looks O
exactly O
as O
in O
photo O
. O
light O
weight O
and O
works O
like O
a O
charm O
. O
would O
definitely O
recommend U-quality

Small U-appearance
and O
strong O
. O
  O
Great U-quality
dryer O
for O
travel U-scenario
. O
  O
Also O
has O
dual O
voltage O
. O
  O
Glad O
I O
bought O
it O
! O

Not O
as O
good O
as O
the O
original O
Conair O
1875 O
. O
Makeovers O
and O
upgrades O
do O
n't O
always O
yield O
the O
best O
results O
. O
For O
instance O
, O
this O
1875 O
replica O
. O
Lacks O
the O
basic O
functions O
a O
blow O
dryer O
should O
have O
, O
such O
as O
temperature O
adjustment O
. O
There O
is O
only O
a O
setting O
for O
high O
and O
low O
fan O
speed O
. O
Also O
, O
in O
order O
to O
use O
the O
air O
only O
feature O
with O
no O
heat O
, O
the O
cooling O
button O
has O
to O
be O
pressed O
and O
held O
down O
to O
use O
this O
basic O
function O
. O
This O
causes O
a O
person O
's O
fingers O
to O
get O
tired O
, O
holding O
a O
button O
over O
using O
a O
sliding O
switch O
. O
Then O
there O
is O
the O
retracted O
cord O
that O
is O
missing O
. O
That O
was O
probably O
the O
most O
valuable O
feature O
for O
the O
original O
Conair O
1875 O
. O
Made O
the O
dryer O
much O
more O
portable O
. O
Even O
useful O
when O
not O
traveling O
. O
Now O
the O
new O
1875 O
has O
its O
cord O
sprawled O
all O
over O
the O
bathroom O
counter O
. O
The O
original O
is O
much O
better O
. O
This O
is O
slightly O
smaller O
with O
about O
10 O
watts O
more O
power O
and O
a O
directional O
air O
controller O
, O
but O
overall O
not O
worth O
the O
investment O
. O

Seems O
to O
be O
working B-quality
well L-quality
, O
was O
easy B-usability
to I-usability
mount L-usability
on O
the O
wall O
. O

This O
is O
the O
2nd O
time O
I O
bought O
this O
little U-appearance
hair O
dryer O
because O
I O
like U-quality
it O
so O
much O
. O
My O
first O
one O
finally O
bit O
the O
dust O
after O
about O
3 O
years O
. O
It O
's O
very O
small U-appearance
and O
lightweight O
-- O
a O
plus O
for O
the O
suitcase O
, O
but O
still O
powerful U-power
enough O
to O
blow O
dry O
my O
hair O
fast O
. O
I O
have O
short O
hair O
, O
and O
this O
sweet O
little O
dryer O
is O
all O
I O
need O
to O
dry O
and O
style O
my O
hair O
-- O
no O
need O
for O
a O
comb O
or O
brush O
. O
It O
's O
no O
frills O
-- O
only O
2 O
speeds O
-- O
high O
and O
low O
. O
But O
it O
does O
exactly O
what O
I O
need O
it O
to O
, O
and O
it O
does O
it O
fast O
! O

No B-quality
complaints L-quality

not B-quality
good L-quality

I O
have O
just O
used O
it O
once O
, O
but O
it O
worked B-quality
great L-quality
. O
Dried O
my O
hair O
in O
about O
15 O
minutes O
. O

Compact U-appearance
yet O
powerful U-power
. O
Easy B-usability
to I-usability
pack L-usability
and O
travel U-scenario
with O
. O
Excellent O
value O
for O
the O
price O
. O
Much O
better O
blow O
dryers O
are O
available O
, O
but O
for O
the O
price O
this O
more O
than O
satisfied O
my O
needs O
. O

Powerful U-power
, O
lots O
of O
fan O
settings O
, O
cold O
air O
button O
, O
and O
best O
of O
all O
, O
a O
retractable O
cord O
! O
I O
like O
the O
folding O
handle O
for O
traveling U-scenario
, O
too O
. O
Great B-quality
product L-quality
. O
I O
can O
blow O
my O
hair O
dry O
and O
blow O
out O
of O
here O
for O
a O
quick O
appointment O
! O

So O
far O
, O
so B-quality
good L-quality
... O

The O
cold O
button O
stuck O
on O
the O
2nd O
use O
. O
  O
Now O
have O
to O
have O
it O
replaced O
. O
  O
Just O
annoying O
to O
have O
to O
deal O
with O
this O
. O

It O
broke O
the O
third O
time O
I O
used O
it O
piece O
of O
crap O

Very O
powerful U-power
. O
Dries O
my O
hair O
quickly U-dryingspeed
. O

The O
ends O
are O
pink U-appearance
. O
Not O
what O
I O
expected O

This O
is O
a O
very O
nice U-quality
hair O
blow O
dryer O
. O
  O
The O
color U-appearance
is O
a O
lovely O
medium O
shade O
of O
pink O
that O
is O
in O
a O
matte O
tone O
versus O
a O
plastic O
looking O
shiny O
one O
. O
  O
The O
dryer O
comes O
with O
a O
diffuser O
which O
works O
well O
for O
my O
curly O
hair O
. O
  O
It O
has O
an O
unusual O
type O
of O
soft O
touch O
finish O
. O
  O
It O
does O
n't O
feel O
slippery O
at O
all O
. O
  O
It O
fits O
well O
in O
the O
hand O
and O
the O
finish O
seems O
to O
be O
it O
fit O
a O
little O
more O
snug O
that O
others O
I O
have O
had O
before O
. O
The O
air O
filter O
is O
removable O
and O
be O
sure O
to O
clean O
it O
about O
once O
a O
week O
. O
  O
I O
destroyed O
a O
blow O
dryer O
by O
not O
cleaning O
the O
filter O
- O
it O
overheats O
the O
motor O
and O
kills O
it O
pretty O
quickly O
. O
  O
Along O
with O
the O
diffuser O
, O
there O
is O
a O
very O
narrow O
concentrator O
attachment O
which O
works O
really O
well O
if O
you O
need O
to O
put O
heat O
on O
a O
precise O
spot O
. O
  O
There O
are O
three O
heat U-temperature
settings O
and O
two O
speeds U-dryingspeed
. O
  O
There O
is O
also O
a O
cool O
shot O
button O
for O
getting O
the O
air O
cool O
quickly O
as O
you O
are O
styling O
. O
The O
interesting O
thing O
about O
this O
blow O
dryer O
( O
apart O
from O
the O
finish O
) O
is O
that O
it O
is O
much O
quieter U-noisy
than O
others O
I O
have O
had O
. O
  O
My O
first O
thought O
was O
that O
it O
meant O
that O
it O
was O
n't O
as O
powerful O
but O
that O
is O
not O
the O
case O
. O
  O
It O
works O
well O
and O
is O
not O
as O
loud O
. O

Product O
is O
just O
as O
described O
. O
Super O
fast O
delivery O

It O
's O
a O
good U-quality
hair O
dryer O
for B-price
the I-price
price L-price
. O
  O
I O
do O
find O
that O
it O
smells O
like O
it O
's O
burning O
on O
High O
/ O
Hot O
. O
I O
use O
it O
on O
warm O
and O
low O
so O
it O
's O
just O
fine O
for O
my O
needs O
. O
I O
tried O
a O
SalonSalon O
hair O
dryer O
at O
a O
friends O
house O
which O
was O
fabulous O
- O
turns O
out O
it O
costs U-price
$ B-price
169 L-price
! O
  O
Way O
out O
of O
my O
budget O
. O
This O
one O
will O
probably O
last O
a O
year O
and O
then O
I O
'll O
probably O
buy O
another O
Sassoon O
tourmaline O
ceramic O
- O
helps O
keep O
the O
fly O
aways O
from O
flying O
away O
! O

This O
is O
a O
great U-quality
hair O
dryer O
with O
loads O
of O
power U-power
. O
  O
It O
feels O
like O
a O
salon O
dryer O
. O

The O
diffuser O
made O
my O
curly O
hair O
really O
frizzy O
and O
messy O
. O

Cute U-appearance
and O
stylish O

Not O
as O
hot O
and O
powerful U-power
as O
I O
expected O
and O
somehow O
it O
does O
not O
deliver O
any O
kind O
of O
expected O
shining O
usually O
produced O
by O
professional O
ceramic O
dryers O
... O

This O
product O
arrived O
in O
an O
open O
box O
. O
The O
cord U-attachment
was O
pushed O
into O
the O
box O
. O
Looked O
as O
if O
it O
had O
been O
returned O
. O
But O
it O
arrived O
quickly O
and O
it O
works O
. O
Small U-appearance
easy O
to O
travel U-scenario
with O
. O

Not O
a O
bad O
dryer O
! O
Yes O
, O
heavy U-usability
, O
but O
sleek O
as O
can O
be O
and O
does O
n't O
burn O
my O
hair O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
one O
to O
write O
reviews O
but O
I O
thought O
I O
'd O
do O
it O
for O
this O
product O
. O
I O
have O
fine O
, O
curly O
hair O
but O
LOTS O
of O
it O
. O
It O
was O
taking O
me O
a O
good O
25 O
minutes O
to O
blow O
dry O
my O
hair O
every O
other O
day O
and O
I O
was O
getting O
tired O
of O
it O
. O
I O
felt O
like O
I O
'd O
tried O
about O
every O
hair O
dryer O
( O
affordable O
) O
in O
the O
store O
. O
I O
decided O
I O
'd O
try O
an O
expensive U-price
salon O
one O
to O
see O
if O
that O
'd O
do O
the O
trick O
. O
So O
I O
splurged O
and O
bought O
the O
Buttercup O
Dry O
Bar O
hair O
dryer O
. O
It O
worked B-quality
well L-quality
but O
only O
cut O
my O
drying O
time O
down O
about O
5 O
minutes O
and O
in O
all O
honesty O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
think O
it O
was O
worth O
the O
$ O
200 O
. O
I O
came O
across O
the O
John O
Frieda O
hair O
dryer O
and O
read O
some O
good O
reviews O
so O
decided O
I O
'd O
give O
it O
a O
shot O
, O
plus O
it O
was O
much O
more O
affordable O
than O
the O
Dry O
Bar O
. O
Well O
, O
I O
loved O
it O
! O
It O
only O
took O
me O
11 O
minutes O
to O
blow O
dry O
this O
mane O
of O
mine O
plus O
it O
gave O
it O
extra O
shine O
and O
my O
ends O
do O
n't O
look O
so O
dry O
. O
It O
also O
straightened O
out O
my O
hair O
better O
than O
any O
other O
hair O
dryer O
I O
've O
had O
which O
cut O
down O
my O
flat O
iron O
time O
, O
as O
well O
. O
The O
only O
cons O
are O
that O
the O
buttons O
are O
placed O
in O
an O
odd O
location O
and O
it O
has O
a O
weird O
hum O
but O
you O
get O
used O
to O
that O
real O
quick O
, O
so O
it O
did O
n't O
really O
bother O
me O
all O
that O
much O
. O
But O
I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
this O
product O
! O

I O
am O
giving O
this O
hair O
dryer O
5 B-quality
stars L-quality
for O
being O
so O
amazingly O

I O
've O
had O
mine O

about O
7 O
years O
now O
and O
works O
like O
the O
day O
i O
got O
it!Just O
do O
yourself O
a O
favor O
and O
unscrew O
the O

then O
and O
clean O
the O
lint O
out O
of O
the O
filter O
( O
wire O

on O

) O

I O
bought O
this O
for O
my O
girl O
to O
keep O
her O
from O
buying O
another O
Walmart O
bargain O
. O
I O
can O
tell O
it O
's O
quieter U-noisy
than O
most O
and O
she O
says O
it O
dries O
her O
hair O
faster U-dryingspeed
. O
Nice O
lightweight O
unit O
, O
ergonomically O
designed O
. O
The O
cleanable O
filter O
on O
the O
back O
is O
a O
nice O
feature O
. O

Bang O
for O
the O
buck O
very O
good O
. O
Good B-quality

I O
've O
owned O
like O
3 O
or O
4 O
blow O
driers O
in O
my O
time O
. O
I O
'm O
not O
so O
good O
about O
consistently O
using O
them O
because O
I O
'm O
lazy O
. O
Well O
, O
I O
also O
know O
how O
harsh O
blow O
- O
drying O
can O
be O
on O
hair O
( O
particularly O
colored O
like O
mine O
) O
, O
so O
I O
tend O
to O
avoid O
it O
. O
But O
every O
so O
often O
( O
more O
so O
in O
the O
winter O
) O
, O
I O
find O
I O
need O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
quickly O
instead O
of O
waiting O
. O
My O
last O
hair O
dryer O
died O
in O
a O
blaze O
of O
glory O
- O
well O
, O
actually O
it O
more O
or O
less O
fizzled O
and O
refused O
to O
turn O
on O
. O
So O
when O
this O
popped O
up O
in O
my O
Vine O
selection O
, O
I O
selected O
it O
. O
This O
Remington O
hair O
dryer O
comes O
with O
attachments O
- O
one O
, O
a O

, O
that O
looks O
like O
an O
alien O
product O
( O
apparently O
used O
for O
curly O
hair O
) O
, O
and O
a O
funnel O
appendage O
that O
reminds O
me O
of O
an O
airplane O
wind O
tunnel O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
curly O
hair O
so O
I O
did O
n't O
bother O
with O
the O
diffuser O
( O
I O
really O
wish O
it O
had O
not O
been O
included O
because O
all O
it O
does O
it O
take O
up O
valuable O
drawer O
space O
) O
, O
but O
I O
did O
test O
out O
the O
Wind O
Tunnel O
( O
much O
as O
I O
like O
pretending O
it O
's O
a O
wind O
tunnel O
for O
miniature O
airplanes O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
know O
, O
what O
is O
this O
thing O
called O
really?).I O
love O
all O
the O
settings O
! O
My O
last O
hair O
dryer O
pretty O
much O
had O
hi O
- O
lo O
, O
hot O
- O
cold O
and O
that O
was O
it O
. O
This O
has O
3 O
heat O
settings O
and O
2 O
speeds O
along O
with O
a O
cold O
blast O
setting O
, O
allowing O
for O
a O
more O
controlled O
drying O
experience O
. O
I O
found O
it O
really O
dried O
my O
thick O
, O
wavy O
hair O
well O
( O
another O
reason O
why O
I O
hate O
drying O
my O
hair O
- O
it O
usually O
takes O
30 O
minutes O
for O
it O
to O
be O
all O
dry O
) O
and O
relatively O
quickly O
. O
The O
Wind O
Tunnel O
also O
helped O
to O
ensure O
nice O
, O
smooth O
, O
straight O
hair O
- O
the O
way O
I O
like O
to O
style O
my O
hair O
. O
Overall O
, O
I O
'm O
impressed O
and O
pleased O
. O
I O
wish O
that O
the O
diffuser O
had O
n't O
been O
included O
because O
I O
have O
no O
need O
for O
it O
and O
the O
space O
it O
takes O
up O
BUT O
I O
know O
that O
those O
with O
curly O
hair O
may O
appreciate O
it O
. O
UPDATE O

: O
While O
I O
still O

this O

I O

since O
received O
a O
Bio O

I O
like O
more O

The O

Cool O
Burst O
is O
far O
too O
easily O
activated O
when O
I O
am O
drying O
my O
hair O
, O
a O
problem O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
with O
the O
Bio O
Ionic O
. O
Therefore O
, O
I O
am O
taking O
away O
1 O

Great U-quality
Hairdryer O
, O
affordable O
price O
, O
delivery O
was O
quick O
, O
like O
the O
packaging O
and O
the O
extra O
hair O
drying O
tips O
you O
get O
by O
email O
. O
Wishing O
it O
had O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
power U-power
in O
the O
cool O
blast O
but O
no O
big O
deal O
. O
I O
m O
pleased O
that O
I O
bought O
this O
product O
to O
replace O
my O
old O
hairdryer O
which O
took O
20mins O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
, O
happy O
to O
say O
it O
has O
cut O
the O
timing O
of O
drying O
my O
long O
hair O
down O
to O
8minutes O
and O
leaves O
my O
hair O
smooth O
enough O
not O
to O
use O
the O
GHD O
hair O
irons O
. O
Only O
major O
downside O
is O
that O
it O
is O
quite O
noisy O
. O

I O
love U-quality
this O
hair O
dryer O
; O
the O
available O
speeds O
and O
temperatures O
are O
perfect O
and O
it O
's O
the O
most O
quiet O
hair O
dryer O
I O
've O
ever O
owned O
. O
  O
The O
only O
drawback U-quality
for O
me O
is O
the O
placement O
of O
the O
on O
- O
off O
switch O
; O
it O
's O
located O
at O
the O
very O
bottom O
of O
the O
handle O
so O
I O
have O
to O
use O
two O
hands O
to O
turn O
it O
on O
or O
off O
. O
  O
A O
better O
design O
would O
be O
to O
reverse O
the O
placement O
of O
the O
buttons O
so O
it O
could O
be O
turned O
on O
/ O
off O
easily O
with O
my O
thumb O
; O
currently O
, O
the O
speed O
/ O
temperature O
button O
is O
easily O
reached O
with O
my O
thumb O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
change O
that O
very O
often O
. O
  O
That O
is O
the O
only O
reason O
I O
did O
n't O
give O
it O
five B-quality
stars L-quality
. O
  O
Nevertheless O
, O
I O
still O
highly O
recommend O
it O
and O
would O
buy O
it O
again O
. O

This O
dryer O
is O
exactly O
what O
I O
wanted O
very O
lightweight O
and O
does O
the O
job O

This O
is O
the O
best O
dryer O
I O
have O
ever O
used O
. O
It O
is O
n't O
all O
that O
quiet O
, O
and O
though O
it O
's O
not O
really O
heavy O
, O
it O
is O
bigger O
than O
I O
'm O
used O
to O
and O
so O
still O
a O
bit O
unwieldy O
in O
my O
unpracticed O
hands O
, O
but O
it O
dries O
my O
thick O
, O
coarse O
, O
shoulder O
- O
length O
hair O
faster O
than O
any O
other O
device O
I O
have O
ever O
used O
. O
It O
also O
leaves O
my O
hair O
notably O
silkier O
and O
more O
manageable O
than O
other O
dryers O
. O
The O
Allure O
would O
seem O
to O
offer O
the O
benefits O
of O
an O
expensive O
professional O
tool O
at O
a O
surprisingly O
reasonable O
price O
. O
Hoping O
it O
holds O
up O
over O
time O
, O
and O
planning O
to O
purchase O
another O
to O
keep O
at O
my O
summer O
cottage O
. O

My O
wife O
is O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
hair O
dryer O
and O
she O
has O
very O
full O
, O
THICK O
hair O
! O

So O
far O
so O
good O

blow O
holes O
are O
only O
at O
the O
top O
would O
be O
great O
if O
they O
were O
at O
the O
sides O

Never O
had O
a O
blow O
dryer O
tangle O
my O
hair O
and O
make O
it O
limp O
. O
It O
does O
get O
your O
hair O
dry O
slowly O
. O

Good O
as O
expected O

This O
is O
my O
third O
Hot O
Tools O
bonnet O
dryer O
in O
25 O
years O
. O
I O
love O
it O
: O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O
I O
, O
too O
had O
the O
bonnet O
constantly O
unhooking O
from O
the O
hose O
but O
realized O
after O
the O
second O
dryer O
that O
the O
bonnet O
has O
a O
notch O
inside O
the O
ring O
that O
clicks O
to O
keep O
the O
connected O
to O
the O
bonnet O
. O
The O
dryer O
does O
get O
very O
but O
with O
4 O
heist O
settings O
I O
keep O
lower O
it O
after O
10 O
- O
15 O
minutes O
then O
every O
five O
. O

Nice O
quality O
, O
fairly O
quiet O
, O
nice O
looking O
and O
not O
too O
big O
. O
  O
I O
bought O
two O
. O

Very O
Much O
Worth O
It O
! O

I O
was O
hoping O
for O
a O
quieter O
blow O
dryer O
. O
This O
is O
definitely O
quieter O
than O
my O
other O
dryer O
, O
but O
still O
not O
quiet O
. O
I O
also O
read O
all O
kinds O
of O
reviews O
that O
said O
this O
dries O
your O
hair O
so O
it O
's O
smooth O
and O
silky O
. O
The O
only O
thing O
that O
makes O
my O
hair O
smooth O
and O
silky O
is O
product O
! O

Have O
had O
it O
for O
about O
4 O
years O
and O
thought O
it O
did O
a O
good O
enough O
job O
. O
  O
I O
use O
it O
on O
  O
medium O
heat O
/ O
blow O
settings O
and O
always O
clean O
the O
air O
intake O
screen O
at O
the O
first O
sign O
of O
lint O
. O
  O
However O
, O
it O
has O
recently O
been O
throwing O
out O
sparks O
and O
some O
actual O
flames O
. O
  O
At O
first O
it O
was O
a O
high O
pitched O
screeching O
noise O
, O
then O
popping O
, O
then O
sparks O
, O
now O
FLAMES O
! O
  O
It O
is O
in O
the O
trash O
and O
I O
will O
be O
looking O
for O
a O
better O
dryer O
. O
  O
Funny O
that O
my O
mother O
has O
had O
the O
same O
dryer O
for O
over O
15 O
years O
, O
but O
this O
modern O
high O
tech O
stuff O
is O
just O
mass O
produced O
junk O
! O

Best O
blow O
dryer O
i O
have O
purchased O
in O
a O
long O
time O

I O
have O
been O
using O
an O
older O
model O
Remington O
hair O
dryer O
, O
and O
, O
while O
that O
model O
has O
held O
up O
well O
with O
daily O
use O
for O
over O
3 O
years O
, O
this O
newer O
model O
is O
lighter O
weight O
and O
slightly O
smaller O
yet O
produces O
the O
same O
results O
as O
the O
old O
model O
. O
This O
Remington O
says O
that O
it O
has O
micro O
conditioners O
to O
prevent O
heat O
damage O
and O
increase O
hair O
shine O
. O
It O
also O
says O
that O
its O
ceramic O
technology O
prevents O
hair O
damage O
and O
dries O
hair O
faster O
. O
Since O
using O
the O
Remington O
hair O
dryers O
( O
daily O
) O
my O
hair O
( O
untreated O
and O
treated O
) O
do O
not O
show O
hair O
damage O
at O
all O
- O
no O
split O
ends O
, O
no O
dry O
/ O
brittle O
, O
no O
fly O
- O
away O
. O
Whether O
this O
is O
attributable O
to O
the O
dryer O
or O
my O
hair O
product O
( O
changed O
when O
I O
started O
treating O
my O
hair O
) O
, O
I O
can O
not O
say O
. O
I O
use O
shampoo O
& O
conditioners O
about O
every O
other O
day O
and O
dry O
my O
hair O
every O
day O
. O
Dry O
time O
is O
fast O
. O
The O
new O
model O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
have O
a O
faster O
dry O
, O
but O
the O
dry O
time O
is O
pretty O
quick O
nonetheless O
. O
I O
do O
not O
use O
either O
attachment O
. O
This O
dryer O
comes O
with O
a O
diffuser O
( O
Remington O
caught O
flak O
with O
the O
last O
model O
not O
including O
a O
diffuser O
) O
and O
a O
directional O
blower O
. O
Both O
are O
standard O
plastic O
. O
Overall O
, O
this O
Remington O
dryer O
works O
well O
, O
dry O
well O
, O
and O
should O
last O
a O
number O
of O
years O
if O
it O
follows O
in O
previous O
models O
' O
footsteps O
. O
Very O
happy O
with O
the O
feel O
and O
results O
. O

needs O
an O
expensive O
transformer O

I O
love O
how O
compact O
it O
is O
and O
how O
amazing O
it O
works O
! O
! O
! O

This O
is O
a O
great O
dryer O
for O
the O
price O
. O
I O
have O
n't O
noticed O
my O
strands O
being O
shiny O
or O
silky O
, O
  O
but O
the O
dryer O
dries O
quickly O
and O
is O
n't O
very O
loud O
. O
  O
I O
appreciate O
the O
different O
heat O
and O
speed O
settings O
. O
The O
barrel O
is O
longer O
than O
most O
other O
dryers O
I O
've O
used O
but O
it O
is O
n't O
hard O
to O
grip O
or O
control O
. O
It O
is O
boxed O
nicely O
and O
comes O
with O
a O
diffuser O
attachment O
. O
I O
would O
recommend O
this O
productIf O
you O
check O
out O
the O
pictures O
in O
other O
's O

you O
'll O
see O
they O
have O
had O
luck O
with O
smooth O
, O
shiny O
hair O
. O
I O
have O
not O
gotten O
a O
chance O
to O
use O
it O
that O
much O
to O
see O
results O
and O
I O
've O
been O
using O
texturing O
product O
which O
also O
is O
n't O
conducive O
to O
smooth O
or O
shiny O
hair O
. O

It O
's O
not O
that O
small O
, O
and O
quite O
heavy O
. O
It O
works O
reall O
well O
! O
But O
not O
really O
portable O
, O
or O
light O
enough O
to O
be O
a O
travel O
dryer O

Good O

order O
again O

Love O
it O

at O
the O
beginning O

  O
After O
few O
months O
of O
use O
, O
it O
gets O
over O
hot O
easily O

I O
have O
to O
stop O

it O

My O
purchase O

two O
heat O
settings O
, O
high O
and O
low O
. O
Two O
speed O
settings O
, O
high O
and O
low O
, O
and O
it O
has O
an O
on O
/ O
off O
ionic O
knob O
. O
It O
has O
an O
adjustable O
pole O
which O
is O
great O
when O
you O
have O
more O
than O
one O
person O
using O
it O
. O
It O
also O
has O
wheels O
so O
it O
is O
easy O
for O
me O
to O
roll O
it O
around O
the O
house O
. O
This O
is O
much O
better O
that O
the O
hooded O
dryer O
that O
I O
had O
to O
sit O
on O
the O
table O
and O
find O
a O
chair O
low O
enough O
so O
I O
could O
fit O
under O
the O
hood O
. O
I O
use O
my O
dryer O
on O
a O
weekly O
basis O
. O
The O
hood O
is O
very O
roomy O
and O
has O
a O
flip O
up O
front O
. O
I O
can O
dry O
my O
hair O
with O
large O
rollers O
with O
no O
problem O
. O
Now O
I O
can O
get O
the O
salon O
feel O
of O
the O
hair O
dryer O
at O
home O
. O

A O
non O
working O
product O
. O
Just O
west O
of O
time O
and O
energy O
. O
Well O
they O
refund O
my O
money O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
recommend O
this O
product O
. O

Best O
one O

This O
had O
terrible O
reviews O
but O
it O
was O
the O
only O
one O
I O
could O
find O
with O
the O
3 O
things O
I O
wanted O
: O
diffuser O
, O
retractable O
cord O
, O
and O
folding O
handle O
. O
I O
figured O
for O
the O
price O
it O
was O
with O
a O
try O
. O
I O
'm O
so O
glad O
I O
did O
because O
I O
love O
it O
! O
I O
do O
n't O
understand O
the O
negative O
reviews O
. O
It O
dries O
my O
hair O
quickly O
and O
my O
very O
curly O
hair O
looks O
great O
! O

We O
have O
just O
gotten O
rid O
of O
all O
the O
hair O
dryers O
in O
the O
house O
to O
try O
some O
new O
ones O
( O
the O
last O
ones O
should O
have O
been O
thrown O
out O
years O
ago O
) O
and O
this O
one O
works O
great O
. O
My O
wife O
and O
daughter O
have O
very O
kinky O
curl O
hair O
and O
it O
takes O
time O
to O
dry O
their O
hair O
but O
this O
product O
cuts O
that O
time O
in O
half O
which O
is O
great O
. O
Very O
strong O
firm O
hair O
dryer O
that O
feels O
high O
end O
upon O
picking O
it O
up(although O
very O
affordable O
looking O
at O
the O
price O
) O
. O
My O
daughter O
has O
taken O
over O
this O
one O
in O
her O
bathroom O
( O
she O
loves O
the O
color O
purple O
) O
so O
we O
have O
let O
her O
take O
possession O
of O
this O
one O
. O
Great O
hair O
dryer O
that O
you O
would O
expect O
to O
see O
at O
a O
high O
end O
salon O
. O

This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
one O
of O
the O
fastest O
drying O
hair O
dryers O
I O
've O
ever O
used O
. O
It O
also O
looks O
sleek O
and O
professional O
. O
I O
like O
that O
it O
comes O
with O
multiple O
attachments O
to O
give O
you O
the O
best O
blow O
dry O
you O
can O
get O
. O
I O
only O
have O
a O
few O
issues O
with O
this O
particular O
hair O
dryer O
. O
It O
blows O
really O
hard O
. O
Even O
on O
the O
slowest O
setting O
, O
the O
air O
blows O
out O
very O
forcefully O
. O
If O
I O
need O
precision O
drying O
, O
I O
have O
to O
use O
the O
diffuser O
attachment O
, O
otherwise O
my O
hair O
gets O
blown O
to O
smithereens O
. O
Another O
problem O
is O
the O
rocker O
switch O
design O
. O
When O
I O
'm O
using O
this O
, O
the O
rocker O
switch O
controls O
on O
the O
handle O
are O
very O
easy O
to O
push O
and O
I O
'm O
regularly O
having O
to O
reset O
my O
settings O
. O
After O
I O
while O
this O
gets O
very O
annoying O
. O
It O
seems O
to O
be O
lasting O
me O
pretty O
well O
. O
I O
've O
been O
using O
it O
almost O
one O
year O
and O
have O
n't O
had O
any O
trouble O
with O
its O
performance O
. O
I O
hope O
it O
lasts O
me O
a O
few O
more O
years O
. O
Overall O
, O
this O
hair O
dryer O
is O
usable O
but O
might O
cause O
some O
frustration O
. O

Absolutely O
the O
best O
hair O
dryer O
I O
've O
ever O
owned O
hands O
down O
! O
! O
! O
! O
I O
love U-quality
this O
dryer O
so O
freakin O
fast O
it O
's O
amazing O
. O
Came O
in O
less O
than O
a O
weeks O
time O
. O
Very O
pleased O
! O

So O
far O
so B-quality
good L-quality
. O

Over O
heated O
in O
2 O
minute O
! O
We O
had O
to O
return O
it O
and O
had O
to O
pay O
bubble O
rap O
to O
sent O
it O
back O
to O
Amazon O
. O
Good O
luck O
if O
you O
want O
to O
order O
this O
through O
online O
. O

Nice B-quality
quality L-quality
. O

It O
works B-quality
great L-quality
and O
I O
have O
n't O
had O
any O
issues O
at O
all O
. O

I O
only O
had O
the O
blow O
dryer O
for O
less O
than O
3 O
months O
and O
the O
heating O
element O
went O
. O

I O
purchased O
the O
dryer O
about O
9 O
month O
ago O
. O
It O
is O
alway O
stay O
at O
my O
home O
in O
one O
place O
. O
I O
occasionally O
used O
it O
and O
never O
moved O
it O
. O
Now O
it O
can O
not O
stand O
anymore O
. O
The O
plastic O
base O
and O
3 O
legs O
are O
broken O
. O
I O
called O
the O
customer O
service O
and O
they O
said O
the O
warranty O
only O
for O
60 O
days O
. O

works B-quality
great L-quality
! O
love U-quality
it O
! O

This O
thing O
is O
still O
going O
almost O
a O
year O
later O

The O
speed O
and O
heat O
settings O
are O
wonderful O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
get O
that O
gross O
feeling O
like O
it O
is O
burning O
my O
hair O
, O
or O
blowing O
it O
insanely O
, O
like O
with O
other O
blow O
driers O
. O
It O
is O
very O
convenient O
for O
storage O
. O

So O
far O
so O
good O

Nice O
quality O
. O

Works O
just O
fine O
. O
  O
No O
problems O
. O

Excellent O
  O
hair O
dryer O

This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
hair O
dryer O
you O
will O
probably O
ever O
find O
. O
It O
is O
very O
powerful O
and O
dries O
my O
hair O
quite O
quickly O
. O
Plus O
the O
folding O
design O
makes O
it O
easy O
to O
stash O
away O
. O
In O
addition O
, O
it O
's O
relatively O
small O
so O
it O
's O
not O
taking O
up O
a O
ton O
of O
room O
in O
your O
suitcase O
. O
A O
win O
all O
around O
. O

I O
love O
this O
little O
hair O
dryer O
. O
I O
have O
arthritis O
and O
the O
larger O
dryers O
are O
hard O
to O
manipulate O
. O
I O
also O
have O
short O
, O
thin O
hair O
so O
this O
little O
dryer O
makes O
it O
easier O
to O
use O
a O
roll O
brush O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O
I O
would O
n't O
recommend O
it O
for O
someone O
with O
thicker O
hair O
as O
the O
heat O
is O
not O
as O
strong O
or O
powerful O
as O
an O
1875 O
but O
it O
's O
great O
for O
me O
. O

Holy O
cow O
... O
maybe O
it O
's O
because O
my O
old O
dryer O
died O
6 O
weeks O
ago O
and O
I O
have O
n't O
blow O
dried O
since O
( O
what O
can O
I O
say O
? O
  O
It O
's O
hot O
and O
I O
'm O
too O
lazy O
to O
fancy O
up O
in O
the O
summer O
) O
but O
WOW O
this O
thing O
works O
fast O
. O
  O
It O
's O
cute O
, O
it O
's O
small O
, O
but O
it O
packs O
a O
punch O
! O

The O
dryer O
itself O
was O
really O
nice O
but O
the O
packaging O
could O
have O
been O
better O
. O

cool O
speed O
is O
perfect O
for O
my O
hair O
. O
  O
no O
frizz O
or O
dryness O

No O
warm O
setting O
! O
Ca O
n't O
use O
! O

I O
wish O
it O
was O
a O
little O
bit O
stronger O
and O
a O
little O
bit O
hotter O
but O
it O
does O
the O
trick O
.. O
I O
have O
thick O
THICK O
hair O
and O
my O
blow O
drying O
skills O
are O
subpar O
so O
In O
the O
hands O
of O
a O
skilled O
person O
i O
d O
say O
4 O
stars O
! O

It O
's O
good O
. O
I O
like O
3 O
level O
of O
heat O
. O

Great O
blow O
dryer O
, O
just O
a O
little O
more O
heavy O
than O
I O
expected O

I O
love O
my O
hot O
pink O
mini O
- O
pro O
, O
so O
lightweight O
and O
Powerful O
! O
  O
The O
super O
cute O
tote O
bag O
is O
a O
plus O
! O
  O
Perfect O
for O
travel O
but O
I O
use O
mine O
everyday O
. O
  O
I O
did O
n't O
think O
it O
would O
be O
as O
good O
as O
my O
big O
, O
clunky O
, O
heavy O
dryer O
, O
but O
this O
little O
baby O
gets O
HOT O
, O
has O
a O
lower O
setting O
also O
. O
  O
I O
have O
shoulder/ O
hand O
issues O
and O
now O
they O
do O
n't O
hurt O
when O
I O
blow O
dry O
my O
hair O
! O
  O
Love O
it O
! O
! O

Good O
hair O
dryer O
. O
It O
can O
make O
your O
hair O
more O
straight O

kinda O
heavy O
compared O
to O
other O
hair O
dryers O

Excellent B-quality

This O

a O

  O
Yesterday O
the O

stopped O
working O
and O
now O
it O
only O
blows O
cool O
air O
. O
  O
I O
thought O
since O
it O
was O
a O
Revlon O
product O
and O
it O
was O
n't O
cheap O
that O
it O
would O
last O
for O
years O
. O
  O
I O
was O
wrong O
:( O

I O
bought O
this O
for O
my O
sister O
for O
her O
to O
use O
it O
for O
college O
. O
it O
came O
really O
fast O

  O
Some O
of O
these O

seem O
to O
be O
from O
a O

mind O
rather O
than O
real O

blow O
dry O
my O
hair O
( O
with O
an O
ordinary O
dryer O
) O
. O
Now O
I O
bet O
I O
have O
cut O
down O
my O
drying O
time O
by O
at O
least O
half O
if O
not O
more O
. O
Ca O
n't O
beat O
the O
price O
for O
this O
type O
of O
technology O
! O

buttons O
interfere O
with O
handle O
. O
  O
always O
turning O
off O

From O
Ms. O
s1rude O
. O
I've O
been O
using O
an O
older O
model O
Remington O
hairdryer O
for O
years O
, O
so O
I O
was O
able O
to O
compare O
this O
model O
to O
an O
another O
model O
of O
the O
same O
brand O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
model O
number O
on O
my O
current O
hairdryer O
because O
all O
of O
the O
writing O
has O
been O
rubbed O
off O
, O
but O
it O
has O
a O
single O
switch O
to O
select O
hi O
/ O
low O
warm O
speeds O
or O
cool O
mode O
. O
The O
AC2015C O
has O
two O
switches O
, O
one O
allows O
you O
to O
select O
between O
three O
temperatures O
, O
the O
other O
between O
two O
speeds O
. O
There O
is O
a O
cool O
shot O
button O
. O
I O
have O
fine O
, O
straight O
shoulder O
length O
hair O
and O
do O
n't O
really O
use O
my O
dryer O
for O
anything O
other O
than O
drying O
, O
so O
I O
've O
never O
understood O
the O
purpose O
of O
a O
cool O
shot O
button O
. O
Were O
I O
to O
use O
this O
function O
, O
I O
prefer O
my O
existing O
drying O
because O
you O
can O
set O
it O
to O
cool O
mode O
with O
the O
switch O
, O
while O
the O
new O
model O
requires O
you O
to O
hold O
the O
button O
down O
continuously O
for O
cool O
air O
. O
The O
AC2015C O
is O
more O
than O
twice O
as O
heavy O
as O
and O
slightly O
larger O
than O
my O
existing O
dryer O
, O
which O
I O
did O
n't O
care O
for O
. O
Pros O
of O
the O
AC2015C O
are O
that O
it O
is O
a O
nice O
looking O
dryer O
, O
and O
if O
its O
anything O
like O
my O
old O
Remington O
, O
it O
will O
probably O
last O
forever O
. O
For O
now O
I O
'm O
planning O
to O
stick O
with O
old O
reliable O
; O
its O
lighter O
and O
more O
straightforward O
. O

WORKS O
GREAT O
! O
! O
JUST O
WHAT O
I O
WANTED O
! O
! O
! O

Traveling O
abroad O
? O
  O
Most O
foreign O
countries O
use O
220 O
VAC O
instead O
of O
the O
USA O
120 O
VAC O
. O
  O
This O
means O
that O
if O
you O
try O
your O
hair O
dryer O
overseas O
it O
will O
work O
for O
about O
1 O
second O
and O
fail O
. O
  O
This O
unit O
has O
a O
voltage O
selector O
switch O
so O
it O
will O
work O
no O
matter O
what O
the O
voltage O
is O
. O
  O
Folds O
to O
much O
smaller O
unit O
, O
name O
branded O
. O
  O
Remember O
to O
buy O
the O
correct O
country O
plug O
adaptor O
. O

Love O
love O
love O
it O
. O
Best O
one O
yet O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
uses O
this O
more O
than O
I O
do O
. O
  O
He O
seems O
to O
enjoy O
it O
. O

I O
use O
it O
on O
my O
curly O
air O
. O
  O
Works O
great O
! O

CONS O
: O
I O
took O
a O
star O
away O
because O
this O
is O
very O
heavy O
in O
hand O
and O
awkwardly O
balanced O
( O
and O
that O
is O
without O
adding O
the O
removable O
tip O
) O
. O
The O
PROS O
: O
It O
came O
impressively O
/ O
beautifully O
packaged O
, O
it O
looks O
beautiful O
, O
feels O
well O
made O
, O
it O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
drying O
power O
, O
and O
is O
not O
too O
loud O
. O

Awesome O
dryer O
! O
I O
was O
on O
the O
fence O
for O
a O
while O
but O
now O
I O
'm O
addicted O
. O
Leaves O
my O
fine O
, O
fizzy O
, O
dry O
hair O
soft O
and O
smooth O
and O
my O
hair O
just O
keeps O
getting O
healthier O
. O
If O
you O
are O
waiting O
, O
don't O
... O
you O
just O
have O
to O
try O
this O
once O
and O
you O
will O
be O
sold O
! O

I O
bought O
this O
hair O
blower O
cause O
I O
lost O
the O
back O
of O
my O
other O
blow O
dryer O
I O
must O
say O
this O
has O
been O
my O
favorite O
blow O
dryer O
I O
have O
really O
curly O
hair O
and O
this O
blow O
dryer O
does O
the O
job O
it O
's O
very O
hot O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
spend O
to O
much O
time O
on O
one O
piece O
of O
hair O
every O
time O
I O
do O
my O
hair O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
just O
came O
out O
the O
salon O

I O
just O
love O
it O
! O

god O
product O

Does O
not O
turn O
off O
. O

It O
stays O
true O
to O
it O
's O
name O
as O
it O
is O
indeed O
mini O
, O
and O
I O
would O
n't O
buy O
this O
if O
I O
have O
thicker O
hair O
. O

This O
was O
for O
3 O
months O
the O
Best O
investment O
yet O
for O
my O
hair O
. O
I O
have O
used O
a O
cheaper O
hair O
dryer O
forever O
, O
but O
this O
was O
worth O
every O
penny O
. O
However O
it O
broke O
and O
will O
not O
shoot O
out O
and O
warm O
it O
hot O
air O
. O
Most O
disappointing O
product O
yet O
in O
Amazon O
I O
have O
bought O
because O
it O
worked O
for O
awhile O
so O
well O
. O
I O
have O
to O
purchase O
a O
new O
hair O
dryer O
... O
unfortunately O
it O
wo O
n't O
be O
this O
one O
again O
. O
As O
a O
woman O
who O
takes O
pride O
in O
her O
hair O
I O
need O
something O
more O
reliable O
and O
safe O
. O

Great O
hair O
dryer O
! O
  O
Love O
having O
the O
hair O
dryer O
ready O
to O
use O
but O
out O
of O
the O
way O
mounted O
to O
the O
wall O
. O
  O
We O
have O
one O
in O
each O
bathroom O
! O

Love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
It O
's O
louder O
than O
I O
'm O
used O
to O
but O
my O
hair O
seems O
smoother O
. O

It O
's O
a O
good O
, O
no O
- O
nonsense O
hair O
dryer O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
rating O
it O
as O
such O
. O
  O
Three O
heat O
settings O
and O
two O
speeds O
give O
it O
great O
versatility O
to O
do O
a O
speed O
dry O
or O
more O
leisurely O
styling O
assistance O
. O
I'm O
particularly O
fond O
of O
the O
removable O
filter O
... O
this O
is O
replacing O
an O
older O
hair O
dryer O
that O
was O
very O
difficult O
to O
clean O
. O
  O
I O
'm O
less O
fond O
of O
the O
attachments O
... O
not O
that O
they O
are O
bad O
or O
anything O
, O
only O
that O
I O
've O
never O
used O
any O
kind O
of O
attachments O
for O
a O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
They O
seem O
a O
little O
loose O
though O
, O
so O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
of O
their O
ultimate O
utility O
. O
This O
does O
put O
out O
plenty O
of O
power O
, O
and O
it O
seems O
like O
a O
clean O
heat O
without O
a O
ton O
of O
noise O
. O
  O
It O
's O
not O
whisper O
- O
quiet O
, O
but O
it O
does O
seem O
a O
little O
more O
discreet O
than O
my O
old O
hair O
dryer O
. O
So O
  O
I O
do O
like O
this O
- O
it O
's O
handy O
with O
a O
decent O
amount O
of O
power O
behind O
it O
. O
  O
As O
I O
said O
, O
it O
's O
no O
- O
nonsense O
. O
  O
And O
I O
appreciate O
it O
. O

My O
wife O
loves O
this O
thing O
, O
she O
said O
It O
feels O
like O
a O
real O
saloon O
. O

LOVE U-quality
this O
hair O
dryer O
! O

Best O
dryer O
I O
have O
ever O
owned O
. O

junk O
... O
the O
diffuser O
does O
not O
fit O
on O
the O
dryer O
. O
My O
whole O
reason O
for O
purchasing O
this O
item O
! O

I O
used O
this O
blow O
dryer O
for O
4 O
years O
until O
it O
randomly O
broke O
one O
day O
but O
it O
always O
gave O
my O
hair O
a O
silky O
, O
smooth O
, O
and O
shiny O
finish O
( O
I O
have O
straight O
hair O
) O
. O
I O
would O
say O
the O
noise O
level O
is O
average O
, O
not O
too O
loud O
but O
not O
whisper O
quiet O
either O
. O
It O
has O
all O
the O
heat O
and O
speed O
settings O
you O
could O
need O
for O
a O
blow O
out O
and O
the O
retractable O
cord O
is O
the O
best O
feature O
because O
it O
prevents O
a O
dreaded O
tangled O
mess O
. O

very O
nice O
hair O
dryer O
and O
good O
price O
too O
! O

Did O
not O
work O
in O
Italy O

Gets O
the O
job O
done O
. O
Downfall O
is O
the O
bonnet O
connection O
keeps O
popping O
off O
so O
you O
must O
keep O
reattaching O
it O
. O

Good O
! O

Dryer O
works O
great O
but O
be O
careful O
with O
cord O
. O
Last O
one O
the O
cord O
worked O
free O
from O
dryer O
and O
it O
was O
shooting O
sparks O
out O
of O
cord O
. O

Quite O
  O
compact O
. O
Seems O
  O
very O
  O
sturdy O
  O
High O
  O
setting O
  O
very O
  O
strong O
  O
but O
  O
quite O
  O
loud O

It O
is O
everything O
I O
expected O
.. O

works O
great O

Shipment O
takes O
a O
bit O
long O
but O
very O
good O
product O

I O
have O
had O
alot O
of O
hair O
dryers O
over O
the O
years O
, O
i O
liked O
this O
one O
because O
it O
was O
pink O
and O
I O
could O
order O
it O
on O
Amazon O
Prime O
. O
However O
... O
the O
highest O
setting O
blows O
more O
like O
a O
medium O
/ O
low O
setting O
which O
just O
erks O
me O
. O
If O
you O
have O
thin O
hair O
you O
probably O
wo O
n't O
mind O
but O
if O
you O
have O
thicker O
hair O
like O
myself O
this O
is O
just O
pain O
annoying O
! O
` O

Bought O
as O
a O
replacement O
for O
the O
previous O
version O
of O
this O
dryer O
because O
it O
finally O
stopped O
working O
after O
more O
than O
5 O
years O
, O
but O
I O
was O
disappointed O
when O
I O
received O
it O
because O
the O
power O
cord O
is O
way O
too O
short O
and O
the O
power O
itself O
is O
not O
nearly O
as O
strong O
as O
the O
previous O
model O
. O
It O
'll O
work O
for O
now O
but O
I O
would O
definitely O
not O
buy O
it O
again O
. O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
blow O
dryer O
for O
the O
price O
, O
and O
it O
is O
more O
lightweight O
than O
my O
trusty O
Revlon O
/ O
Helen O
of O
Troy O
model O
that O
's O
still O
ticking O
even O
after O
numerous O
drops O
on O
my O
bathroom O
floor O
. O
Like O
the O
numerous O
dial O
settings O
, O
BUT O
this O
dryer O
does O
not O
that O
hot O
. O
  O
But O
maybe O
that O
's O
to O
be O
expected O
because O
this O
is O
a O
damage O
control O
blow O
dryer O
, O
and O
heat O
- O
along O
with O
chemicals O
like O
peroxide O
and O
ammonia O
- O
is O
one O
of O
your O
hair O
's O
biggest O
enemies O
. O
  O
Have O
always O
dried O
my O
hair O
on O
the O
lowest O
heat O
and O
speed O
settings O
, O
and O
the O
cool O
shot O
should O
be O
highly O
distinguishable O
from O
a O
warm O
setting O
. O
  O
On O
this O
hair O
dryer O
, O
you O
can O
barely O
tell O
them O
apart O
. O
  O
All O
heat O
settings O
feel O
relatively O
the O
same O
. O
The O
verdict O
is O
that O
, O
using O
this O
dryer O
, O
it O
took O
a O
LONGER O
time O
to O
dry O
my O
thick O
hair O
. O
  O
However O
, O
my O
hair O
did O
come O
out O
nice O
and O
shiny O
. O

Not O
use O
yet O
, O
but O
I O
like O
it O
. O

Woks O
good O

Works O
very O
well O
. O
I O
just O
wish O
it O
had O
a O
simple O
on O
- O
off O
switch O
in O
addition O
to O
a O
multi O
- O
function O
slide O
switch O
. O
Just O
a O
small O
quibble O
. O

conair O
always O
makes O
good O
products O

Great O
size O
and O
has O
adequate O
power O
... O

Small U-appearance
, O
compact U-appearance
, O
powerful U-power
! O

I O
want O
you O
to O
send O
me O
a O
new O
one O
. O
  O
After O
1.5 O
years O
of O
using O
this O
, O
it O
blew O
up O
on O
me O
. O

This O

Even O

this O
dryer O
as O
it O
comes O
highly O
recommended O
by O
professional O
stylists O
. O
  O
I O
used O
it O
twice O
, O
it O
dried O
my O
hair O
quickly O
and O
somewhat O
smooth O
using O
a O
ceramic O
ion O
brush O
. O
  O
I O
was O
pleased O
with O
the O
results O
, O
after O
all O
this O
was O
a O
big O
step O
up O
from O
the O
half O
broken O
one O
I O
purchased O
from O
Sally O
's O
years O
ago O
. O
  O
Then O
I O
visited O
my O
mother O
who O
recently O
purchased O
a O
new O
drier O
, O
the O
rusk O
w8less O
. O
  O
She O
told O
me O
I O
should O
try O
it O
. O
  O
When O
I O
used O
the O
rusk O
I O
was O
amazed O
at O
how O
fast O
it O
dried O
my O
hair O
and O
how O
  O
smooth O
and O
silky O
my O
hair O
felt O
. O
  O
I O
was O
in O
LOVE O
! O
! O
! O
It O
was O
a O
huge O
step O
up O
from O
the O
twinturbo O
. O
  O
I O
had O
to O
have O
the O
rusk O
, O
so O
I O
returned O
the O
twinturbo O
. O
  O
I O
could O
not O
be O
happier O
w O
the O

Cons O
: O
Heavy O
, O
the O
wind O
screen O
on O
the O
back O
has O
no O
cover O
, O
just O
flimsy O
screen O
. O
On O
both O
occasions O
I O
used O
the O
drier O
my O
long O
hair O
was O
sucked O
into O
the O
screen O
, O
causing O
it O
to O
tangle O
and O
burn O
. O
  O
In O
my O
opinion O
this O
is O
a O
design O
flaw O
. O
The O
hole O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
dryer O
is O
the O
circumference O
of O
my O
fist!Look O
to O
the O
rusk O
w8less O
! O
  O
It O
's O
an O
outstanding O
dryer O
! O

I O
bought O
this O
hair O
drier O
for O
my O
girlfriend O
3 O
months O
ago O
, O
expecting O
it O
to O
be O
great O
. O
The O
attachments O
do O
not O
attach O
to O
the O
drier O
! O
It O
is O
now O
useless O
to O
her O
and O
too O
late O
to O
exchange O
the O
product O
. O

The O
wire O
mesh O
over O
the O
vacuum O
in O
the O
back O
was O
n't O
even O
attached O
. O
I O
had O
to O
super O
glue O
it O
down O
so O
the O
blow O
dryer O
would O
n't O
suck O
hair O
into O
the O
back O
of O
it O
. O

It O
's O
nice O
. O
I O
thought O
the O
cool O
shot O
had O
a O
locking O
button O
, O
but O
it O
does O
n't O
. O
That O
was O
the O
main O
reason O
I O
bought O
it O
. O
It O
does O
work O
well O
and O
it O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
over O
heat O
like O
me O
other O
one O
. O

The O
fan O
speed O
is O
stable O

temperature O
selection O
is O
very O
useful O
, O
neither O
too O
cold O
nor O
too O
hot O
for O
me O
with O
short O
hair~~Highly O
reommend O
! O

The O
hair O
dryer O
itself O
is O
great O
; O
but O
the O
volumizing O
finger O
diffuser O
is O
terrible O
. O
  O
The O
fingers O
on O
the O
attachment O
are O
made O
of O
rubber O
and O
break O
off O
. O

I O
just O
really O
like O
this O
hairdryer O
. O
  O
In O
fact O
, O
I O
purchased O
this O
item O
to O
replace O
the O
exact O
same O
hairdryer O
, O
which O
I O
had O
for O
probably O
about O
five O
years O
before O
it O
finally O
fizzled O
out O
. O
  O
It O
's O
comfortable O
to O
hold O
, O
it O
dries O
my O
long O
, O
thick O
hair O
quickly O
( O
no O
easy O
feat O

, O
and O
leaves O
my O
hair O
smooth O

shiny O

  O
I O
initially O
replaced O
my O
old O
hairdryer O
with O
a O
different O
( O
more O
expensive O
) O
ionic O
hairdryer O
, O
and O
did O
n't O
get O
the O
same O

. O
  O
So O
I O
looked O
for O
an O
exact O
replacement O
on O
Amazon O

and O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O

Junk O
! O
Highly O
NOT O
RECOMENDED O
! O
It O
was O
broke O
for O
a O
week O
used O
! O

I O
'm O
on O
the O
road O
vacationing O
and O
brought O
this O
dryer O
with O
me O
. O
I O
have O
very O
long O
hair O
and O
swim O
a O
lot O
in O
chlorinated O
pools O
. O
That O
means O
a O
ton O
of O
showers O
and O
wet O
hair O
. O
This O
dryer O
works O
great O
for O
me O
; O
it O
is O
quiet O
, O
efficient O
and O
really O
dries O
my O
hair O
quickly O
. O
It O
sn't O
so O
hot O
that O
it O
burns O
my O
fine O
hair O
. O
The O
bonus O
is O
that O
I O
get O
a O
smooth O
textured O
outcome O
that O
air O
drying O
just O
does O
n't O
give O
me O
. O
On O
the O
aesthetic O
side O
I O
love O
the O
textured O
feel O
to O
this O
dryer O
's O
exterior O
. O
It O
has O
a O
silky O
matte O
finish O
that O
I O
very O
much O
enjoy O
. O
Lovely O
color O
as O
well O
. O

My O
hairdryer O
was O
noisy O
and O
past O
its O
prime O
, O
so O
I O
was O
delighted O
to O
try O
this O
new O
Remington O
dryer O
. O
It O
's O
sleek O
and O
it O
's O
quiet O
. O
It O
's O
a O
bit O
heavier O
than O
my O
old O
Conair O
, O
but O
not O
so O
heavy O
as O
to O
be O
uncomfortable O
to O
hold O
. O
In O
fact O
, O
it O
has O
a O
very O
nice O
, O
slim O
grip O
and O
I O
like O
the O
matte O
finish O
. O
My O
hair O
is O
indeed O
shinier O
, O
as O
promised O
. O
An O
unexpected O
extra O
is O
that O
it O
stays O
straighter O
, O
a O
real O
bonus O
in O
heat O
and O
humidity O
. O
I O
may O
never O
use O
the O
attachments O
( O
diffuser O
and O
focused O
stream O
) O
but O
it O
's O
nice O
to O
have O
them O
. O
I O
'm O
enjoying O
my O
new O
dryer O
and O
look O
forward O
to O
a O
long O
relationship O
. O

I O
love O
it O
this O
dryer O
is O
prefect O
for O
my O
daughters O
and O
I O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
hair O
dryer O
at O
a O
fantastic O
price O
. O
  O
It O
contains O
all O
the O
elements O
I O
have O
in O
my O
older O
and O
much O
more O
expensive O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
It O
uses O
ionic O
ceramic O
toumaline O
to O
help O
reduce O
frizz O
and O
static O
that O
occurs O
from O
blow O
drying O
your O
hair O
. O
  O
It O
has O
three O
heat O
settings O
and O
two O
blower O
speeds O
. O
  O
I O
generally O
use O
the O
medium O
heat O
and O
the O
high O
blower O
, O
but O
I O
like O
to O
have O
the O
option O
to O
do O
a O
quicker O
dry O
with O
high O
heat O
when O
needed O
. O
  O
It O
also O
includes O
the O
cool O
shot O
button O
which O
allows O
you O
to O
quickly O
cool O
the O
dryer O
down O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
drying O
and O
styling O
. O
It O
has O
an O
easily O
removable O
filter O
, O
which O
is O
a O
huge O
plus O
. O
  O
I O
once O
ruined O
a O
dryer O
because O
I O
did O
n't O
realize O
I O
needed O
to O
clean O
the O
filter O
. O
  O
Now O
I O
periodically O
take O
the O
filter O
off O
and O
blow O
the O
wrong O
way O
through O
it O
to O
clear O
dust O
that O
accumulates O
through O
time O
. O
  O
I O
do O
this O
about O
one O
a O
week O
or O
so O
and O
it O
helps O
keep O
the O
dryer O
running O
well O
and O
from O
burning O
out O
. O
  O
I O
have O
placed O
a O
towel O
hook O
next O
to O
my O
bathroom O
sink O
and O
I O
hang O
the O
dryer O
on O
it O
. O
  O
It O
keeps O
it O
off O
the O
counter O
, O
saving O
room O
and O
keeping O
it O
within O
easy O
reach O
. O
The O
dryer O
comes O
with O
both O
a O
concentrator O
for O
when O
you O
are O
styling O
your O
hair O
or O
trying O
to O
focus O
the O
drying O
effort O
as O
well O
as O
a O
diffuser O
. O
The O
latter O
is O
important O
for O
me O
as O
my O
hair O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
wave O
and O
curl O
and O
blow O
drying O
it O
without O
the O
diffuser O
turns O
it O
all O
to O
frizz O
instead O
of O
curls O
. O
I'm O
very O
pleased O
with O
this O
dryer O
and O
recommend O
it O
as O
a O
good O
and O
fairly O
inexpensive O
choice O
. O

I O
already O
have O
the O
D3190A O
, O
which O
is O
a O
LOT O
like O
this O
AC215C O
that O
I O
selected O
for O
my O
daughter O
because O
she O
likes O
this O
color O
better O
than O
the O
purple O
. O
They O
both O
have O
the O
cool O
shot O
feature O
which O
we O
love O
, O
and O
the O
cleanable O
filter O
( O
* O
VERY O
important O
feature O
to O
keep O
airflow O
going O
strong O
) O
which O
is O
key O
to O
its O
ability O
to O
dry O
hair O
quickly O
, O
you O
would O
think O
all O

dryers O
would O
have O
it!Now O

a O
head O
full O

an O

this O
is O
just O

my O
hair O
faster O
. O
But O
my O
hair O
has O
been O
getting O
split O
ends O
and O
damaged O
, O
so O
I O
love O
that O
this O
dryer O
is O
designed O
to O
protect O
against O
heat O
damage O
. O
Only O
time O
will O
tell O
if O
that O
feature O
works O
, O
but O
I O
sure O
need O
it O
. O
This O
also O
has O
the O
usual O
attachments O
that O
I O
never O
use O
but O
they O
look O
the O
same O
as O
what O
typically O
comes O
with O
a O
blow O
dryer O
. O
My O
biggest O
problem O
with O
blow O
dryers O
is O
the O
motor O
dies O
from O
not O
regularly O
cleaning O
the O
lint O
filter O
( O
which O
draws O
in O
dust O
and O
causes O
the O
motor O
to O
overheat O
) O
. O
So O
one O
great O
feature O
is O
this O
Remington O
has O
a O
removable O
filter O
for O
easy O
cleaning O
, O
and O
that O
will O
definitely O
prolong O
the O
life O
of O
the O
hair O
dryer O
if O
the O
filter O
is O
cleaned O
out O
regularly O
. O
My O
hair O
comes O
out O
smooth O
and O
nice O
with O
the O
Remington O
. O
My O
favorite O
part O
about O
the O
design O
is O
it O
's O
comfortable O
to O
hold O
, O
the O
controls O
are O
placed O
well O
for O
comfortable O
use O
and O
most O
of O
all O
it O
's O
super O
lightweight O
. O
Also O
, O
this O
dryer O
is O
not O
as O
loud O
as O
most O
others O
. O
It O
looks O
great O
in O
purple O
too O
. O
I O
do O
wish O
the O
cord O
was O
a O
little O
longer O
. O
It O
's O
long O
enough O
for O
plugging O
into O
a O
high O
outlet O
in O
a O
bathroom O
, O
but O
if O
I O
need O
to O
use O
a O
lower O
outlet O
in O
another O
room O
  O
then O
the O
cord O
is O
too O
short O
for O
me O
to O
stand O
and O
dry O
my O
hair O
( O
though O
adequate O
if O
I O
sit O
down O
) O
. O
I O
'm O
used O
to O
a O
longer O
cord O
, O
so O
others O
may O
not O
mind O
the O
cord O
length O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
taking O
one O
star O
off O
as O
I O
think O
the O
cord O
should O
be O
at O
least O
a O
foot O
longer O
. O
Overall O
, O
however O
, O
I O
definitely O
recommend O
this O
hair O
dryer O
as O
it O
has O
great O
features O
, O
works O
very O
well O
and O
is O
such O
a O
great O
value O
! O

Worked O
great O
for O
about O
6 O
months O
, O
then O
simply O
would O
no O
longer O
turn O
on O
. O

have O
n't O
gotten O
to O
use O
it O
yet O
. O
Ca O
n't O
get O
the O
elastic O
in O
the O
bonnet O
to O
open O
wide O
enough O
to O
get O
over O
the O
rollers O
. O
It O
is O
a O
painful O
attempt O
even O
without O
rollers O
. O
I O
will O
have O
to O
go O
to O
JoAnns O
and O
get O
some O
elastic O
and O
rethread O
the O
bonnet O
opening O
first O
. O
So O
when O
I O
finally O
get O
to O
use O
it O
I O
may O
review O
with O
you O
again O
. O
  O
Did O
it O
. O
Removed O
the O
elastic O
and O
it O
works O
much O
better O
. O
I O
will O
still O
put O
back O
in O
a O
much O
longer O
piece O
of O
elastic O
. O

Great O
quality O
. O

Let O
me O
start O
with O
the O
removable O
filter O
which O
allows O
you O
to O
  O
clean O
the O
dust O
out O
, O
my O
previous O
dryers O
did O
not O
have O
this O
option O
and O
the O
filter O
would O
clog O
diminishing O
the O
airflow O
and O
the O
drying O
ability O
. O
That O
is O
why O
this O
is O
such O
an O
important O
feature O
to O
me O
, O
you O
would O
think O
all O
hair O
dryers O
would O
have O
it!Now O
to O
its O
features O
: O
it O
has O
3 O
heat O
settings O
and O
2 O
power O
settings O
( O
* O
wish O
there O
were O
3 O
! O
) O
annnd O
a O
cool O
shot O
which O
Iove O
, O
Love O
, O
LOVE O
! O
I O
have O
very O
thin O
, O
fine O
hair O
and O
when O
I O
set O
my O
hair O
with O
heat O
rollers O
I O
use O
the O
cool O
shot O
feature O
to O
speed O
up O
the O
set O
and O
my O
curls O
stay O
in O
longer O
as O
the O
hair O
is O
more O
cooled O
down O
before O
I O
take O
the O
rollers O
out O
so O
the O
curls O
do O
n't O
fall O
out O
as O
quickly O
as O
they O
used O
to O
, O
my O
set O
lasts O
longer O
. O
I O
use O
the O
concentrator O
but O
have O
no O
need O
for O
the O
diffuser O
but O
if O
you O
are O
naturally O
curly O
it O
is O
a O
nice O
attachment O
to O
have O
. O
It O
has O
the O
heat O
protection O
ionic O
technology O
that O
helps O
keep O
your O
hair O
frizz O
and O
fly O
away O
free O
, O
dries O
hair O
fast O
( O
I O
have O
long O
hair O
) O
and O
does O
n't O
tangle O
it O
up O
when O
just O
doing O
a O
blow O
dry O
and O
not O
setting O
my O
curls O
. O
It O
has O
a O
2 O
year O
warranty O
and O
is O
at O
a O
GREAT O
price O
for O
what O
you O
get O
. O
I O
would O
recommend O
this O
dryer O
. O

Love O
it O
! O
Just O
did O
not O
get O
any O
papers O
to O
register O
/ O
warrantee O
on O
this O
product O
. O

It O
's O
a O
bit O
heavy O
but O
I O
LOVE O
IT O
! O
I O
have O
curly O
, O
frizzy O
hair O
and O
it O
has O
helped O
control O
it O
. O
The O
price O
it O
GREAT O
too O
. O
I O
ca O
n't O
compare O
it O
to O
a O
high O
end O
dryer O
but O
within O
this O
price O
range O
it O
's O
# O
1 O
. O

excelente O
! O
! O
! O
! O

Good O
. O

Needed O
a O
new O
dryer O
and O
have O
been O
shopping O
around O
for O
a O
while O
. O
  O
I O
've O
looked O
at O
this O
one O
online O
a O
few O
times O
but O
could O
n't O
justify O
the O
price O
. O
  O
Then O
it O
  O
went O
on O
sale O
and O
I O
jumped O
on O
it O
. O
  O
Just O
got O
it O
, O
first O
use O
. O
  O
It O
's O
not O
silver O
, O
like O
the O
one O
pictured O
, O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
buy O
it O
for O
color O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
care O
( O
mine O
is O
kind O
of O
a O
gunmetal O
black O
) O
. O
  O
Beautifully O
packaged O
, O
easy O
to O
understand O
directions/ O
switches O
( O
and O
they O
should O
be- O
I O
'm O
drying O
my O
hair O
, O
not O
launching O
a O
rocket O
into O
space O
) O
. O
  O
A O
bit O
heavier O
than O
my O
last O
dryer O
, O
but O
not O
uncomfortable O
. O
  O
I O
did O
notice O
a O
really O
mild O
chemical O
odor O
, O
but O
I O
was O
using O
the O
dryer O
on O
its O
highest O
setting O
and O
I O
'm O
guessing O
it O
had O
to O
do O
with O
the O
casing O
heating O
up O
. O
  O
The O
odor O
did O
go O
away O
and O
it O
was O
never O
overpowering O
and O
did O
n't O
make O
me O
think O
the O
dryer O
was O
going O
to O
explode O
in O
my O
hand O
or O
anything O
. O
  O
The O
dryer O
did O
NOT O
dry O
my O
thick O
, O
mid O
- O
back O
length O
hair O
in O
5 O
minutes O
( O
as O
was O
claimed O
by O
another O
reviewer O
, O
I O
think O
) O
but O
it O
did O
SIGNIFICANTLY O
decrease O
my O
drying O
time O
. O
  O
Took O
about O
22 O
minutes O
down O
from O
40 O
- O
50 O
( O
and O
would O
still O
have O
damp O
spots O
) O
, O
and O
that O
was O
with O
a O
little O
extra O
time O
fiddling O
around O
styling O
because O
..... O
MY O
HAIR O
LOOKS O
AWESOME O
. O
  O
Seriously O
. O
  O
I O
could O
be O
in O
a O
hair O
products O
commercial O
right O
now O
, O
I O
'm O
not O
kidding O
. O
  O
I O
feel O
like O
my O
gorgeous O
hair O
is O
going O
to O
waste O
just O
sitting O
inside O
writing O
an O
Amazon O
review O
, O
but O
this O
baby O
deserves O
it O
so O
I O
sat O
right O
down O
to O
do O
it O
. O
  O
I O
would O
have O
NEVER O
believed O
a O
dryer O
would O
make O
so O
much O
difference O
( O
otherwise O
I O
'd O
have O
bought O
this O
ages O
ago O
) O
, O
but O
truly O
, O
I O
look O
like O
I O
just O
walked O
out O
of O
the O
salon O
. O
  O
I O
want O
to O
stockpile O
these O
so O
I O
never O
have O
to O
live O
without O
it O
. O
  O
This O
was O
a O
phenomenal O
deal O
on O
sale O
, O
but O
I O
would O
pay O
full O
price O
( O
and O
then O
some O
) O
knowing O
what O
I O
know O
now O
. O

Loved O
! O
! O
! O
My O
hair O
is O
dry O
in O
less O
than O
5 O
minutes O
. O
The O
best O
. O

I O
never O
realized O
that O
spending O
a O
little O
more O
on O
a O
hairdryer O
could O
be O
so O
worth O
it O
. O
Cut O
my O
drying O
time O
in O
half O
. O
I O
've O
just O
never O
even O
thought O
of O
ordering O
a O
higher O
end O
hair O
dryer O
. O
Glad O
I O
finally O
wised O
up O
! O

Not O
as O
strong O
as O
the O
older O
built O
unit O
with O
same O
stock O
# O
, O
name O
, O
and O
specs O
. O

LOVE O
it O
. O
Finally O
a O
hairdryer O
that O
has O
powerful O
air O
, O
just O
the O
right O
heat O
settings O
, O
and O
does O
n't O
break O
the O
bank O
. O
Three O
heat O
settings O
that O
feel O
like O
they O
should O
. O
Cold O
. O
Warm O
. O
Hot O
. O
Two O
speed O
settings O
, O
high O
and O
low O
. O
Very O
happy O
with O
the O
ease O
of O
selecting O
what O
I O
want O
, O
plus O
( O
again O
) O
the O
great O
air O
flow O
. O
A O
major O
plus O
is O
not O
having O
the O
high O
- O
pitch O
screeching O
whine O
of O
a O
Conair O
or O
so O
many O
other O
brands O
. O
For O
such O
power O
, O
the O
Allure O
2200W O
is O
a O
relatively O
quiet O
dryer O
. O
On O
a O
noise O
scale O
of O
10 O
, O
I O
would O
venture O
to O
say O
between O
4 O
and O
6 O
, O
depending O
on O
the O
settings O
. O
For O
comparison O
, O
I O
would O
rate O
most O
Conairs O
and O
probably O
most O
other O
blow O
dryers O
I O
've O
used O
at O
between O
7 O
- O
10 O
. O
Not O
dis'ing O
Conair O
, O
just O
mostly O
been O
using O
that O
brand O
for O
the O
past O
decade O
. O
My O
only O
wish O
is O
that O
the O
Allure O
buttons O
were O
on O
the O
right O
side O
( O
as O
opposed O
to O
facing O
inside O
toward O
your O
head O
) O
, O
as O
I O
find O
the O
buttons O
a O
tad O
easy O
to O
inadvertently O
press O
. O
But O
that O
's O
a O
personal O
preference O
. O
Maybe O
you O
'll O
like O
it O
just O
the O
way O
it O
is O
. O
On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
if O
you O
have O
both O
left- O
and O
right O
- O
handed O
family O
members O
, O
this O
might O
be O
a O
good O
solution O
. O
Either O
way O
, O
I O
personally O
love O
this O
dryer O
. O
Five O
stars O
. O

I O
used O
one O
of O
these O
in O
a O
hotel O
while O
on O
vacation O
and O
liked O
it O
so O
much O
I O
came O
home O
and O
ordered O
one O
. O
  O
It O
works O
so O
much O
faster O
than O
my O
older O
one O
. O

Great U-quality
blowdryer O
for B-price
the I-price
price L-price
that O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
. O
However O
, O
the O
High O

is O
noisier O
than O
I O
would O
have O
liked O
. O

GOOD U-quality
! O
! O

! O

Overall O
, O
I O
like O
using O
this O
dryer O

but O
I O
have O
had O
to O
get O
it O
replaced O
twice O
in O
less O
than O
three O
years O
. O
I O
would O
not O

it O

as O
it O
is O
not O
a O
long O

lasting O
product O

My O
most O
recent O
one O
lasted O
ten O

! O

I O
got O
this O
because O
my O
old O
hairdryer O
was O
starting O
to O
get O
beat O
. O
  O
I O
was O
really O
surprised O
at O
how O
quickly O
my O
hair O
dried O
using O
it O
. O
  O
I O
have O
long O
hair O
which O
usually O
takes O
a O
while O
to O
dry O
and O
literally O
it O
took O
just O
a O
few O
minutes O
to O
get O
it O
dry O
. O
  O
Really O
surprising O
. O
  O
And O
it O
was O
nt O
superhot O
either O
. O
  O
I O
also O
had O
more O
shine O
, O
again O
a O
surprise O
. O
  O
I O
do O
nt O
know O
how O
a O
dryer O
can O
shine O
your O
hair O
but O
it O
does O
. O
  O
I O
did O
nt O
expect O
the O
claims O
on O
the O
box O
to O
really O
be O
true O
, O
particularyl O
at O
this O
dryers O
price O
. O
  O
A O
great O
deal O
! O

I O
normally O
do O
not O
use O
a O
hair O
dryer O
but O
my O
office O
now O
has O
a O
gym O
; O
after O
working O
out O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
my O
very O
long O
hair O
dripping O
all O
over O
the O
place O
. O
My O
hair O
is O
straight O
so O
I O
do O
not O
need O
the O
diffuser O
attachments O
that O
came O
with O
this O
dryer O
. O
I O
was O
surprised O
at O
how O
quiet O
this O
hair O
dryer O
is O
and O
how O
much O
volume O
of O
warming O
air O
it O
generates O
. O
My O
hair O
was O
dry O
in O
minutes O
. O
This O
dryer O
is O
light O
and O
very O
efficient O
. O
I O
love O
the O
color O
. O
Very O
impressive O
addition O
to O
my O
hair O
care O
regime O
. O

Bought O
this O
to O
take O
on O
a O
trip O
to O
Europe O
. O
  O
I O
love O
how O
it O
folds O
and O
how O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
convert O
the O
voltage O
. O
  O
Most O
importantly O

this O
small O

in O
the O

I O
saw O
absolutely O
no O

how O
my O
fine O

prone O

frizz O
in O

my O

The O

felt O
like O
it O
took O
less O

the O
reason O
is O
most O
likely O
because O
it O
’s O
the O
lightest O

the O
three O

The O

plastic O

the O

better O

But O
it O
could O
be O
the O
better O
quality O
materials O
that O
make O
it O
heavier O
. O
I O
can O
only O
assume O
the O
DC O
is O
cheaper O
than O
the O

because O
of O
its O

A O
hair O
dryer O
is O
not O
something O
I O
generally O
replace O
until O
I O
need O
it O
. O
  O
Mine O
is O
still O
working O
, O
  O

I O
had O
been O
saying O
for O
a O
while O
that O
I O
needed O
a O
new O
one O
. O
  O
I O
've O
always O
just O
looked O
at O
it O
as O
something O
that O
blows O
air O
and O
that O
they O
are O
all O
pretty O
much O
the O
same O
. O
  O
After O
using O
this O
one O
a O
few O
times O
, O
  O
I O
will O
never O
say O
that O
again O
. O
  O
This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
awesome O
. O
  O
I O
had O
already O
switched O
my O
curling O
irons O
to O
ionic O
ceramic O
and O
could O
tell O
a O
big O
difference O
, O
  O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
realize O
that O
it O
would O
also O
make O
a O
difference O
in O
a O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
Not O
only O
does O
it O
dry O
my O
hair O
faster O
, O
  O
but O
it O
leaves O
it O
looking O
much O
more O
healthy O
. O
  O
I O
have O
very O
long O
hair O
and O
even O
though O
I O
take O
good O
care O
of O
it O
, O
  O
I O
had O
noticed O
that O
it O
was O
looking O
dull O
and O
dry O
. O
  O
The O
first O
time O
I O
used O
this O
dryer O
, O
  O
I O
could O
tell O
a O
difference O
. O
  O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
all O
the O
how O
or O
why O
reasons O
, O
  O
but O
I O
do O
know O
that O
my O
hair O
did O
n't O
look O
or O
feel O
like O
all O
the O
moisture O
had O
been O
stripped O
from O
it O
. O
  O
I O
had O
even O
started O
to O
air O
dry O
my O
hair O
because O
I O
could O
see O
what O
was O
happening O
to O
it O
, O
  O
but O
that O
takes O
a O
long O
time O
with O
thick O
, O
long O
hair O
. O
  O
I O
will O
still O
air O
dry O
when O
I O
have O
the O
time O
, O
  O
but O
now O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
can O
dry O
my O
hair O
quickly O
( O
and O
this O
dryer O
does O
it O
VERY O
quick O
) O
, O
  O
and O
not O
be O
damaging O
it O
. O
  O
I O
do O
n't O
use O
the O
high O
heat O
on O
this O
one O
because O
it O
's O
very O
hot O
and O
my O
fine O
hair O
would O
n't O
like O
that O
, O
  O
but O
I O
like O
knowing O
that O
the O
option O
is O
there O
if O
needed O
. O
  O
The O
air O
flow O
with O
this O
is O
massive O
..... O
really O
powerful O
... O
When O
on O
high O
, O
  O
I O
can O
dry O
my O
hair O
in O
a O
few O
minutes O
, O
  O
but O
that O
's O
only O
when O
I O
'm O
just O
drying O
it O
to O
put O
in O
a O
ponytail O
. O
  O
Medium O
is O
more O
than O
enough O
airflow O
to O
dry O
and O
style O
it O
, O
and O
I O
love O
the O
cool O
setting O

I O
used O
a O
round O
brush O
to O
curl O
, O
  O
I O
finished O
with O
the O
cool O
setting O
and O
it O
made O
all O
the O
difference O
. O
  O
It O
's O
not O
a O
small O
dryer O
, O
  O
but O
it O
's O
not O
at O
all O
heavy O
, O
  O
especially O
considering O
the O
power O
that O
it O
contains O
. O
  O
They O
include O
a O
little O
card O
explaining O
that O
their O
products O
are O
made O
by O
women O
. O
  O
I O
find O
that O
reassuring O
, O
since O
most O
men O
that O
I O
know O
do O
n't O
really O
use O
one O
, O
  O
therefore O
, O
  O
how O
could O
they O
know O
what O
we O
need O
. O
  O
They O
also O
donate O
a O
portion O
of O
their O
profits O
to O
charities O
that O
benefit O
women O
. O
  O
Between O
that O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
you O
get O
such O
a O
high O
end O

quality O

product O
  O
for O

  O
I O

  O
I O

Got O
this O
for O
my O
mom O
. O
It O
is O
a O
bit O
heavier O
than O
she O
'd O
like O
but O
overall O
she O
loves O
it O
! O

Great O
... O
exactly O
what O
I O
expected O

Needed O
to O
get O
a O
less O
powerful O
blow O
dryer O
when O
I O
moved O
to O
a O
place O
with O
crappy O
outlets O
that O
were O
killing O
my O
other O
dryers O
. O
The O
MiniPro O
is O
super O
tiny O
and O
looks O
like O
it O
could O
be O
for O
a O
doll O
, O
but O
surprisingly O
works O
great O
for O
me O
. O
Made O
well O
and O
feels O
sturdy O
. O
My O
dry O
time O
seems O
to O
be O
shorter O
. O
I O
have O
fine O
hair O
though O
. O
My O
stepdaughter O
has O
long O
medium O
hair O
and O
it O
dried O
her O
pretty O
quick O
as O
well O
. O
Love O
the O
color O
. O
Very O
light O
weight O
and O
will O
be O
perfect O
for O
travel O
. O
Especially O
love O
the O
travel O
bag O
it O
comes O
with O
, O
so O
cute O
! O
Been O
using O
this O
dryer O
a O
few O
weeks O
now O
and O
no O
complaints O
. O
Only O
wish O
is O
that O
it O
had O
a O
cool O
setting O
. O

Quiet O
, O
excellent O
drying O
, O
does O
n't O
get O
dangerously O
hot O
. O

Really O
enjoying O
this O
dryer O
. O
Works O
really O
well O
for O
my O
curly O
hair O
. O
I O
had O
a O
really O
nice O
/ O
pricey O
dryer O
, O
similar O
to O
this O
one O
, O
for O
years O
and O
when O
it O
gave O
out O
I O
bought O
a O
dept O
store O
$ O
30 O
dryer O
. O
I O
noticed O
immediately O
that O
my O
hair O
was O
getting O
frizzy O
. O
I O
used O
that O
for O
several O
months O
and O
then O
finally O
decided O
to O
break O
down O
and O
shell O
out O
the O
cash O
for O
this O
dryer O
. O
So O
glad O
that O
I O
did O
. O
I O
mostly O
use O
it O
with O
the O
curl O
diffuser O
on O
warm O
heat O
. O
I O
get O
great O
curls O
and O
less O
frizz O
. O
On O
occasion O
I O
use O
the O
directional O
attachment O
to O
straighten O
my O
bangs O
or O
all O
of O
my O
hair O
and O
I O
love O
that O
too O
. O
Makes O
my O
hair O
silky O
smooth O
. O
The O
last O
time O
I O
bathed O
my O
dog O
I O
used O
the O
other O
nozzle O
that O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
quick O
dry O
. O
That O
was O
really O
amazing O
. O
Dried O
my O
little O
dog O
in O
no O
time O
. O
I O
was O
happy O
and O
she O
seemed O
to O
be O
relieved O
. O
I O
imagine O
that O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
worry O
about O
frizz O
, O
this O
quick O
dry O
nozzle O
would O
be O
great O
if O
you O
're O
in O
a O
hurry O
. O
I've O
had O
this O
for O
several O
weeks O
and O
I O
would O
recommend O
it O
. O
Hoping O
this O
one O
lasts O
quite O
a O
while O
! O

Nice O
little O
unit O
but O
it O
will O
fry O
your O
body O
parts O
if O
you O
're O
not O
careful O
. O
  O
Very O
powerful O
. O

This O
thing O
is O
awesome O
! O
! O
Small O
, O
compact O
, O
powerful O
. O
This O
thing O
stores O
well O
as O
it O
folds O
up O
, O
for O
those O
of O
us O
that O
have O
limited O
bathroom O
space O
and O
cabinets O
or O
travel O
often O
. O
Conair O
has O
been O
making O
quality O
products O
for O
years O
and O
they O
have O
always O
been O
affordable O
. O

It O
's O
ok O
for O
the O
price O
. O
The O
plastic O
feels O
cheap O
, O
the O
sliding O
button O
occasionally O
is O
difficult O
to O
move O
and O
when O
removing O
the O
difusser O
, O
i O
feel O
as O
i O
may O
break O
it O
. O
The O
plug O
is O
n't O
the O
most O
secure O
either O
, O
seeming O
to O
fit O
loosely O
in O
the O
socket O
. O
Despite O
this O
, O
it O
gets O
hot O
enough O
for O
my O
needs O
and O
has O
n't O
failed O
me O
yet O
after O
about O
6 O
months O
of O
use O
. O
If O
you O
need O
a O
cheap O
blow O
dryer O
this O
is O
a O
great O
pick O
. O

We O
have O
bought O
at O
least O
6 O
of O
these O
.... O
and O
they O
all O
inexplicably O
die O
within O
a O
matter O
of O
one O
year O
! O
! O
  O
I O
should O
have O
stopped O
ordering O
replacements O
, O
lazy O
on O
our O
part O
so O
we O
could O
just O
use O
the O
same O
wall O
mounts O
. O
  O
Time O
to O
try O
another O
brand O
! O
! O
! O

Was O
a O
great O
dryer O
. O
Loved O
it O
. O
However O
it O
burned O
out O
within O
2 O
months O
. O

I O
received O
this O
item O
as O
a O
test O
product O
for O
the O
VINE O
review O
program O
, O
but O
this O
is O
a O
great O
hair O
dryer O
for O
a O
low O
price O
. O
it O
has O
1875 O
watts O
, O
which O
is O
25 O
more O
than O
most O
, O
and O
more O
ion O
presentation O
for O
quicker O
hair O
drying O
. O
Ions O
are O
funny O
things O
Ionized O
air O
respells O
water O
, O
and O
deionized O
water O
falls O
off O
easier O
, O
so O
if O
there O
was O
a O
way O
you O
could O
wash O
your O
hair O
in O
DI O
water O
, O
you O
would O
really O
have O
it O
made O
, O
cleaner O
hair O
that O
dries O
very O
fast O
, O
but O
I O
digress O
. O
This O
dryer O
does O
the O
job O
of O
a O
much O
more O
expensive O
professional O
dryer O
, O
it O
is O
a O
good O
buy O
! O

Great O

I O
was O
afraid O
that O
this O
hair O
dryer O
would O
not O
be O
top O
quality O
because O
of O
the O
price O
. O
However O
, O
everything O
about O
it O
seems O
great O
. O

I O
've O
only O
had O
this O
for O
about O
six O
months O
and O
it O
's O
goes O
off O
and O
on O
while O
I O
'm O
using O
it O
. O
Then O
today O
after O
the O
dryer O
had O
been O
off O
for O
over O
an O
hour O
it O
started O
humming O
as O
if O
it O
were O
& O
quot;stuck&quot O
; O
on O
. O
Ca O
n't O
return O
because O
it O
does O
n't O
fall O
withing O
amazons O
return O
time O
! O
! O
! O
NOT O
NOT O
NOT O
HAPPY O
... O
DO O
NOT O
BUY O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O

I O
like O
the O
dryer O
- O
I O
know O
this O
will O
sound O
silly O
but O
the O
color O
in O
the O
picture O
is O
the O
reason O
I O
chose O
this O
one O
but O
it O
is O
not O
HOT O
pink O
as O
it O
looks O
in O
the O
picture O
it O
is O
more O
like O
a O
Peto O
Bismol O
color O
. O
Other O
than O
that O
it O
is O
fine O
. O

This O
dryer O
leaves O
my O
hair O
shiny O
and O
soft O
, O
has O
good O
variety O
of O
settings O
, O
and O
that O
necessary O
cool O
shot O
of O
air O
to O
set O
my O
hair O
for O
the O
day O
. O
Highly O
recommend O
! O
Ca O
n't O

the O
price O
point O
. O

Love O
this O
! O
GREAT O
Power O
, O
adjustable O
speeds O

awesome O
! O

excelente O

Love O
it O
! O
! O

Nothing O
to O
complaint O
about O
its O
functions O
. O
  O
However O
, O
it O
is O
way O
too O
heavy O
to O
hold O
for O
more O
than O
a O
few O
minutes O
. O
  O
Fine O
for O
my O
short O
hair O
, O
but O
not O
for O
my O
daughter O
's O
long O
hair O
. O

Best O
cheap O
hair O
dryer O
ever O

Love O
this O
blow O
dryer O
! O

Was O
for O
my O
mother O
who O
has O
always O
used O
one O
. O
  O
It O
worked O
wonderfully O
for O
her O
. O
  O
She O
liked O
the O
settings O
for O
heat O
control O
. O
  O
That O
was O
a O
big O
concern O
for O
her O
. O

Works O
very O
good O
for O
the O
price O
but O
WOW O
it O
is O
very O
heavy O
and O
takes O
time O
to O
get O
use O
to O

perfect O
dryer O

For O
the O
price O
( O
and O
based O
on O
other O
reviewers O
) O
, O
I O
was O
expecting O
a O
lot O
more O
. O
  O
I O
have O
very O
long O
, O
thick O
hair O
and O
the O
Sedu O
Revolution O
does O
dry O
my O
hair O
faster O
( O
cut O
about O
10 O
minutes O
off O
drying O
time O
) O
; O
however O
, O
it O
actually O
makes O
my O
hair O
more O
frizzy O
! O
  O
Not O
good O
! O
! O
  O
The O
hair O
dryer O
is O
also O
heavy O
and O
loud O
! O
! O
! O
  O
Based O
on O
the O
packaging O
, O
it O
looks O
like O
I O
received O
a O
previously O
used O
blow O
dryer O
that O
someone O
else O
returned O
. O
  O
I O
would O
never O
recommend O
this O
blow O
dryer O
to O
anyone O
! O

Great O

If O

one O
complaint O

the O
dryer O
itself O
is O
a O
little O
heavy O

other O
than O
that O
it O

Sleek O

hairdryers O
. O
This O
one O
is O
in O
the O
kids O
bathroom O
. O
With O
its O
smaller O
grip O
it O
's O
a O
good O
size O
for O
older O
kids O
and O
teens O
to O
use O
. O
It O
dries O
hair O
fairly O
quickly O
, O
on O
par O
with O
most O
other O
dryers O
we O
've O
owned O
. O
We O
keep O
it O
on O
a O
command O
adhesive O
hook O
above O
the O
outlet O
to O
the O
side O
of O
the O
sinks O
. O
The O
cord O
has O
a O
good O
sized O
built O
in O
loop O
for O
hanging O
. O
I O
was O
really O
happy O
to O
find O
that O
it O
comes O
with O
both O
a O
wide O
, O
flat O
nozzle O
for O
straightening O
as O
well O
as O
a O
diffuser O
for O
curly O
styles O
. O
My O
fancy O
high O
end O
dryer O
did O
n't O
come O
with O
a O
diffuser O
and O
it O
took O
forever O
to O
find O
one O
that O
fit O
. O
I O
also O
like O
that O
it O
has O
a O
cool O
button O
, O
no O
need O
to O
slide O
a O
button O
up O
and O
down O
to O
set O
a O
style O
with O
cool O
air O
. O
My O
one O
complaint O
is O
that O
this O
dryer O
is O
a O
bit O
noisier O
than O
the O
other O
Remington O
dryers O
we O
have O
. O
It O
's O
not O
so O
noisy O
that O
it O
consider O
it O
loud O
for O
a O
hairdryer O
but O
if O
you O
're O
searching O
for O
a O
quiet O
model O
know O
this O
one O
is O
average O
to O
slightly O
above O
average O
as O
far O
as O
noise O
goes O
. O
All O
in O
all O
I O
'm O
impressed O
with O
this O
hairdryer O
. O
It O
's O
a O
fantastic O
value O
at O
this O
price O
point O
. O
All O
our O
other O
Remington O
's O
have O
lasted O
years O
. O

It O
has O
a O
good O
quality O
, O
I O
remember O
my O
daughter O
always O
on O
a O
hurry O
and O
sometimes O
drops O
this O
dryer O
on O
the O
floor O
and O
its O
still O
on O
one O
piece O
, O
that O
is O
so O
great O
, O
it O
did O
n't O
break O
easily O

Delivery O
was O
fast O
, O
within O
a O
week O
. O
The O
first O
time O
using O
it O
I O
noticed O
that O
on O
all O
3 O
settings O
the O
air O
is O
just O
warm O
, O
does O
n't O
get O
very O
hot O
, O
which O
I O
thought O
was O
n't O
that O
big O
of O
a O
deal O
considering O
my O
hair O
is O
bleached O
and O
I O
should O
n't O
be O
putting O
a O
lot O
of O
heat O
on O
it O
anyway O
. O
The O
second O
time O
I O
used O
it O
the O
high O
setting O
just O
did O
n't O
work O
, O
I O
switched O
it O
from O
medium O
to O
high O
and O
it O
just O
turned O
off O
when O
on O
the O
high O
setting O
. O
I O
had O
already O
thrown O
out O
the O
packaging O
at O
this O
point O
so O
since O
it O
was O
only O
like O
$ O
13 O
I O
did O
n't O
feel O
like O
it O
was O
really O
even O
worth O
it O
to O
try O
to O
return O
. O

amazing O
dryer O
! O
! O
it O
makes O
my O
hair O
soft O
and O
easy O
dry O
. O
Even O
though O
the O
price O
is O
expensive O
but O
I O
really O
recommend O
this O
product O
to O
others O
! O
i O
like O
pink O
color O
very O
pretty O
. O
very O
useful O
! O
! O
! O
! O

I O
really O
do O
like O
it O
! O
It O
is O
so O
handy O
and O
drys O
my O
hair O
very O
good O
. O
I O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
that O
needs O
a O
hair O
dryer O
. O

my O
wife O
love O
it O
, O
its O
not O
heavi O
and O
powerfull O

I O
mean O
it O
works O
well O
. O
I O
just O
wish O
they O
'd O
label O
this O
as O
PINK O
AND O
BROWN O
. O

Excellent O
product O
, O
and O
dries O
my O
long O
thick O
hair O
very O
fast O
. O

Works O
excellent O
. O
Light O
weight O
also O
which O
I O
like O
very O
much O
. O

This O
is O
a O
decent O
hair O
dryer O
, O
and O
we O
usually O
buy O
the O
less O
expensive O
ones O
because O
they O
seem O
to O
last O
as O
long O
, O
if O
not O
longer O
, O
than O
more O
expensive O
ones O
. O
  O
On O
this O
one O
, O
the O
handle O
does O
n't O
fold O
, O
which O
is O
kind O
of O
a O
pain O
for O
storing O
, O
and O
it O
only O
has O
two O
heat O
settings O
, O
which O
my O
wife O
found O
to O
be O
either O
too O
hot O
and O
not O
hot O
enough O
, O
so O
she O
went O
back O
to O
her O
old O
one O
. O
  O
The O
removable O
filter O
is O
a O
simple O
plastic O
screen O
that O
screws O
off O
of O
the O
back O
so O
it O
can O
be O
washed O
. O
  O
It O
's O
nothing O
special O
, O
but O
it O
's O
a O
nice O
touch O
that O
you O
can O
remove O
it O
vs. O
trying O
to O
get O
all O
the O
gunk O
out O
while O
wrangling O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
dryer O
. O
  O
We O
do O
n't O
use O
the O
attachments O
for O
curly O
hair O
, O
so O
while O
they O
were O
included O
and O
seem O
durable O
, O
we O
'd O
not O
be O
able O
to O
say O
how O
well O
they O
work O
. O
  O
At O
any O
rate O
, O
it O
's O
a O
good O
dryer O
we O
'll O
keep O
in O
the O
guest O
bathroom O
and O
can O
serve O
as O
a O
functional O
backup O
. O

Bought O
this O
as O
a O
damaged O
box O
item O
. O
It O
was O
in O
perfect O
condition O
. O
It O
is O
a O
professional O
hairdryer O
so O
keep O
in O
mind O
it O
is O
solid O
& O
somewhat O
heavier O
than O
your O
basic O
, O
cheap O
home O
brand O
. O

The O
accent O
parts O
are O
pink O
.. O
a O
light O
princess O
pink O
... O
something O
that O
is O
not O
totally O
obvious O
on O
a O
mobile O
screen O
. O
Not O
a O
big O
deal O
, O
but O
I O
would O
prefer O
white O
or O
black O
. O
Hair O
dryer O
has O
a O
good O
weight O
to O
it O
and O
it O
feels O
solidly O
built O
. O
Hot O
/ O
cold O
function O
works O
fine O
. O
I O
would O
like O
a O
bit O
more O
volume O
to O
the O
air O
, O
something O
that O
all O
newer O
hair O
driers O
seem O
to O
lack O
. O
I O
have O
one O
from O
1991 O
that O
is O
like O
a O
tornado O
on O
its O
highest O
setting O
. O

Everything O
about O
this O
hairdryer O
seems O
nice O
, O
except O
for O
the O
power O
. O
It O
is O
so O
weak O
. O
I O
do O
have O
thick O
hair O
but O
have O
another O
Conair O
that O
is O
much O
more O
powerful O
. O
I O
would O
have O
returned O
this O
, O
but O
was O
able O
to O
swap O
with O
a O
friend O
who O
has O
thin O
hair O
. O

Very O
good O

It O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
! O

Small O
light O
and O
powerful O
. O
  O
I O
love O

Found O

Savannah O
and O
liked O
it O

I O
have O
fine O

this O

does O
n't O
overpower O
me O
or O
my O
hair O
. O
Nice O
and O
lightweight O
. O
You O
might O
think O

girlfriend O
, O
she O
loves O
it O
. O
Ca O

it O
a O
5 O
because O
she O
does O
n't O
believe O
in O
them O
, O
and O
I O
have O
n't O
used O
it O
for O
myself O
seeing O
how O
my O
hair O
is O
nearly O
to O
my O
scalp O
haha O
. O

Worked O

this O
hair O

. O
It O
is O
powerful O
, O
quiet O
and O
dries O
my O
hair O
in O
less O
time O
than O
previous O
dryers O
. O
I O
have O
the O
Elchim O
for O
European O
current O
and O
thought O
it O
worked O
so O
well O
that O
I O
decided O
to O
buy O
one O
that O
uses O
US O
current O
. O
I O
  O
highly O
recommend O
this O
Elchim O
product O
! O

The O
best O
hair O
dryer O
ever O
! O
  O
We O
traveled O
to O
NYC O
over O
the O
summer O
. O
  O
At O
the O
Seton O
Hotel O
, O
these O
were O
the O
hair O
dryers O
they O
had O
for O
guests O
to O
use O
. O
  O
My O
hair O
was O
not O
dry O
. O
  O
It O
had O
a O
variety O
of O
settings O
and O
was O
not O
noisy O
. O
  O
I O
came O
home O
immediately O
an O
ordered O
one O
. O
  O
Wen O
shampoo O
and O
this O
hair O
dryer O
word O
well O
together O
. O
  O
:) O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
heat O
element O
went O
out O
in O
my O
dryer O
less O
than O
one O
year O
into O
owning O
it O
. O
  O
The O
product O
is O
light O
and O
quieter O
than O
most O
dryers O
I O
have O
owned O
. O
  O
Definitely O
made O
my O
hair O
softer O
. O
  O
Still O
would O
recommend O
. O

I O
like O
the O
hair O
dryer O

I O
have O
3B O
curly O
hair O
and O
the O
diffuser O
attachment O
works O
amazing O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
make O
my O
hair O
frizzy O
but O
provides O
a O
lift O
to O
my O
roots O
. O
The O
dryer O
is O
super O
lightweight O
and O
is O
very O
quite O
. O
I O
keep O
it O
on O
low O
and O
the O
power O
is O
still O
amazing O
, O
it O
cut O
my O
hair O
routine O
by O
half O
. O
I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
to O
anyone O
with O
3B O
curly O
hair O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
in O
March O
and O
by O
July O
it O
stopped O
blowing O
hot O
air O
. O
It O
's O
such O
a O
shame O
because O
it O
was O
a O
really O
great O
hair O
dryer O
when O
it O
was O
working O
. O
I O
noticed O
other O
reviewers O
have O
said O
the O
same O
thing O
, O
which O
makes O
me O
think O
it O
's O
a O
flaw O
in O
the O
design O
. O

Excellent O
hair O
dryer O
, O
but O
my O
impression O
is O
that O
the O
controls O
could O
be O
a O
little O
more O
ergonomic O
. O
  O
Quieter O
than O
most O
hair O
dryers O
, O
I O
particularly O
like O
the O
small O
rubber O
nubs O
on O
the O
side O
which O
help O
keep O
it O
on O
your O
counter O
. O
  O
3 O
fan O
settings O
and O
2 O
heat O
settings O
( O
3 O
if O
you O
include O
heat O
off O
) O
plus O
a O
Cool O
shot O
button O
. O

Please O
do O
n't O
buy O
this O
. O
I O
used O
this O
for O
just O
3 O
or O
4 O
times O
and O
now O
started O
getting O
coil O
burning O
smell O
when O
I O
turn O
it O
on O
. O
It O
should O
go O
to O
trash O
now O
. O

I O
like O
the O
looks O
of O
these O
and O
have O
purchased O
a O
number O
of O
them O
for O
the O
rentals O
I O
manage O
as O
they O
mount O
on O
the O
wall O
. O
Out O
of O
about O
six O
I O
've O
bought O
, O
I O
have O
had O
one O
that O
I O
purchased O
in O
May O
2015 O
to O
quit O
working O
, O
although O
it O
's O
had O
very O
little O
use O
. O
But O
, O
I O
am O
replacing O
it O
with O
the O
same O
type O
. O

Too O
Heavy O
. O

I O
am O
quite O
a O
fan O
of O
Remington O
hair O
dryers O
and O
while O
my O
old O
one O
is O
still O
quite O
functional O
, O
I O
prefer O
the O
newer O
Remington O
AC2015C O
T|Studio O
Silk O
AC O
Professional O
Hair O
Dryer O
. O
  O
The O
newer O
model O
has O
basically O
the O
exact O
same O
functions O
as O
my O
older O
, O
far O
more O
expensive O
model O
; O
1875 O
- O
watt O
motor O
, O
two O
attachments O
, O
the O
heat O
settings O
, O
three O
speeds O
, O
and O
a O
cold O
air O
setting O
. O
  O
The O
newer O
Remington O
AC2015C O
is O
heavier O
, O
which O
I O
actually O
prefer O
, O
the O
attachments O
are O
about O
50 O
% O
smaller O
, O
another O
bonus O
for O
me O
, O
as O
I O
already O
have O
straight O
, O
thin O
hair O
, O
and O
the O
other O
attachments O
were O
too O
much O
attachment O
for O
my O
needs O
. O
  O
This O
ceramic O
model O
has O
a O
coating O
that O
I O
like O
; O
it O
keeps O
my O
hands O
from O
slipping O
. O
  O
The O
control O
buttons O
are O
still O
on O
the O
underside O
of O
the O
handle O
, O
which O
I O
prefer O
, O
as O
it O
is O
easier O
to O
adjust O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O
  O
This O
model O
appears O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
faster O
than O
my O
older O
, O
more O
expensive O
model O
, O
and O
both O
offer O
a O
smooth O
, O
frizz O
free O
finish O
. O
  O
I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
hair O
dryer O
, O
it O
does O
what O
it O
says O
it O
does O
and O
the O
price O
is O
fantastic O
. O

Good O
use O
. O
It O
's O
very O
compact O
. O
Make O
sure O
to O
buy O
plug O
head O
adapters O
because O
it O
is O
dual O
voltage O
use O
but O
you O
still O
need O
head O
adapters O
to O
fit O
the O
sockets O
abroad O
. O

Dryer O
was O
delivered O
on O
time O
. O
  O
It O
is O
powerful O
, O
dries O
my O
short O
hair O
in O
2 O
minutes O
and O
is O
n't O
heavy O
. O
  O
Love O
it O
. O

It O
arrived O
within O
2 O
- O
3 O
days O
and O
works O
perfectly O
. O
I O
have O
thick O
, O
frizzy O
, O
curly O
hair O
and O
never O
have O
been O
able O
to O
blow O
dry O
it O
because O
it O
gets O
so O
much O
poofier O
. O
However O
, O
with O
the O
diffuser O
this O
blow O
dryer O
made O
my O
curls O
shiny O
and O
soft O
, O
no O
frizz O
or O
poof O
, O
I O
'm O
in O
love O
! O

very O
nice O

Hard O
to O
find O
a O
small O
, O
lightweight O
travel O
dryer O
that O
we O
use O
everyday O
. O
Works O
great O
and O
very O
portable O
when O
we O
travel O
in O
our O
RV O
. O
Would O
buy O
again O
. O

The O
hair O
dryer O
is O
fine O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
change O
the O
voltage O
, O
but O
I O
bought O
it O
for O
international O
traveling O
, O
and O
it O
's O
a O
big O
con O
for O
me O
that O
the O
switch O
does O
n't O
turn O
to O
250 O
volts O
. O
It O
looks O
as O
though O
it O
can O
easily O
turn O
with O
a O
coin O
. O
Do O
not O
be O
fooled O
. O
It O
's O
impossible O
to O
turn O
the O
switch O
to O
250 O
volts O
. O
I O
stripped O
the O
switch O
bare O
trying O
to O
turn O
the O
damn O
thing O
. O
I O
can O
barely O
see O
where O
the O
arrow O
is O
, O
which O
points O
to O
which O
voltage O
setting O
it O
's O
at O
. O
Luckily O
for O
me O
( O
sarcasm O
) O
, O
mine O
is O
permanently O
at O
125 O
volts O
. O
Maybe O
mine O
was O
faulty O
, O
but O
I O
was O
definitely O
not O
happy O
with O
this O
product O
. O
Would O
not O
recommend O
to O
a O
friend O
. O
Two O
stars O
only O
because O
the O
hair O
dryer O
itself O
works O
fine O
and O
because O
it O
's O
cheap O
. O

Excelent O

The O
hair O
dryer O
is O
great O
. O
Multiple O
hear O
and O
speed O
options O
. O
I O
would O
have O
given O
it O
five O
stars O
except O
for O
that O
fact O
that O
the O
funnel O
tip O
does O
pop O
off O
too O
easily O
if O
bumped O
by O
a O
brush O
. O

Excellent O
hairdryer O
, O
folds O
up O
nicely O
, O
have O
n't O
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
test O
it O
on O
240V O
yet O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
sure O
it O
'll O
do O
just O
fine O
. O
Turning O
the O
dial O
on O
the O
handle O
locks O
you O
out O
of O
putting O
it O
on O
the O
high O
setting O
whenever O
you O
're O
using O
it O
with O
240V O
, O
which O
is O
a O
really O
user O
- O
friendly O
addition O
. O
( O
You O
're O
not O
suppose O
to O
use O
it O
on O
high O
with O
240V O
according O
to O
the O
manual O
. O
) O

works O
great O
, O
no O
need O
to O
purchase O
a O
hairdryer O
with O
a O
price O
tag O
higher O
than O
this O
... O

It O
will O
seriously O
dim O
the O
lights O
in O
your O
house O
, O
but O
man O
can O
it O
dry O
hair O
! O

This O
item O
is O
great!Great O
price O
and O
the O
best O
thing O
I O
like O
is O
that O
I O
'll O
be O
able O
to O
use O
it O
any O
where O
in O
the O
world O
. O
Thanks O
much O

Nice O
dryer O
and O
very O
handy O
wall O
mount O
. O

The O
hair O
dryer O
had O
great O
power O
and O
dried O
my O
hair O
really O
fast O
; O
however O
, O
it O
caught O
fire O
in O
less O
than O
a O
month O
. O
  O
I O
had O
to O
send O
it O
back O
. O

Bought O
this O
for O
my O
girlfriend O
. O
She O
loves O
it O
! O

Dryer O
works O
very O
well O
for O
, O
me O
! O

This O
hair O
drier O
is O
great O
, O
mostly O
because O
it O
is O
much O
quieter O
than O
most O
others O
. O
This O
is O
a O
big O
plus O
, O
especially O
for O
shared O
bathrooms O
. O
It O
comes O
with O
a O
couple O
adapter O
pieces O
that O
either O
diffuse O
the O
air O
or O
focus O
it O
, O
depending O
on O
what O
your O
hair O
is O
like O
. O
It O
is O
clearly O
very O
nice O
quality O
. O
The O
only O
thin O
that O
would O
be O
nice O
is O
a O
retractable O
cord O
, O
but O
that O
is O
a O
small O
quibble O
. O
Highly O
recommended O
! O

I O
have O
ordered O
this O
hair O
dryer O
less O
than O
a O
year O
ago O
and O
it O
is O
already O
broken O
. O
  O
The O
retractable O
cord O
stopped O
fully O
retracting O
after O
about O
4 O
months O
. O
After O
11 O
months O
, O
the O
high O
and O
medium O
settings O
quit O
working O
and O
only O
low O
is O
still O
operational O
. O
I O
expect O
a O
hair O
dryer O
to O
last O
more O
than O
a O
year O
. O

I O
m O
a O
dude O
first O
off O
. O
At O
first O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
real O
heavy O
then O
I O
got O
used O
to O
it O
however O
this O
is O
my O
first O
hair O
dryer O
as O
I O
am O
growing O
my O
hair O
longer O
. O
Ladies O
beware O
of O
the O
weight O
however O
it O
drys O
my O
hair O
very O
quickly O
its O
about O
4 O
in O
all O
the O
way O
around O
right O
now O
and O
takes O
about O
30sec O
tops O
completely O
dry O
. O
When O
you O
buy O
it O
there O
is O
multiple O
settings O
you O
just O
have O
to O
play O
with O
the O
two O
switches O
that O
flip O
up O
and O
down O
. O
NOT O
PICTURED O
IT O
COMES O
WITH O
A O
FUNNEL O
AND O
THE O
FUNNEL O
WITH O
THE O
COMB O
ON O
BOTH O
SIDES!!!!!!!!Im O
1 O
for O
1Take O
my O
advice O
at O
your O
own O
risk O
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
nice O
hair O
dryer O
that O
does O
the O
job O
well O
. O
  O
I O
have O
medium O
length O
hair O
and O
the O
dryer O
dried O
it O
quickly O
. O
  O
I O
hate O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
, O
so O
that O
is O
a O
big O
plus O
factor O
for O
me O
. O
  O
It O
's O
comfortable O
to O
hold O
, O
not O
too O
heavy O
. O
  O
Controls O
are O
easy O
to O
use O
. O
  O
I O
did O
n't O
need O
the O
do O
anything O
fancy O
, O
so O
I O
used O
it O
as O
I O
do O
every O
other O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
The O
box O
says O
it O
's O
professional O
, O
used O
in O
salons O
. O
  O
Hair O
dressers O
could O
comment O
more O
on O
the O
differences O
between O
dryers O
. O
  O
I O
'm O
not O
too O
picky O
about O
it O
as O
long O
as O
it O
is O
n't O
uncomfortable O
to O
use O
and O
works O
well O
. O
This O
one O
is O
just O
fine O
for O
me O
. O
  O
I O
'd O
recommend O

Best O
light O

i O

This O
is O
a O
sturdy O
, O
powerful O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
My O
stylist O
recommended O
it O
and O
it O
DOES O
NOT O
disappoint O
! O
! O

I O
have O
had O
this O
hair O
dryer O
for O
just O
over O
a O
year O
- O
379 O
days O
to O
be O
exact O
and O
this O
morning O
when O
I O
went O
to O
turn O
it O
on O
, O
no O
dice O
. O
Dead O
. O
I O
have O
had O
ConAir O
hair O
dryers O
that O
have O
cost O
$ O
20 O
last O
longer O
than O
this O
one O
, O
so O
to O
say O
I O
'm O
unhappy O
is O
an O
understatement O
! O
I O
do O
n't O
even O
use O
it O
everyday- O
maybe O
3 O
times O
per O
week O
AND O
last O
summer O
, O
I O
left O
it O
while O
I O
traveled O
for O
over O
2 O
months O
, O
so O
the O
life O
of O
this O
this O
thing O
was O
seriously O
short O
. O
BEWARE~ O

We O
like O
this O
little O
beast O
around O
here O
, O
I O
have O
short O
thick O
somewhat O
unruly O
hair O
, O
my O
daughter O
has O
long O
curly O
naughty O
at O
times O
hair O
. O
It O
works O
well O
for O
both O
of O
us O
. O
It O
got O
the O
job O
done O
fast O
with O
out O
being O
uncomfortably O
hot O
and O
feeling O
very O
heavy O
. O
That O
's O
not O
to O
say O
its O
very O
small O
or O
it O
would O
not O
make O
the O
best O
grab O
and O
go O
pack O
it O
up O
dryer O
, O
but O
its O
no O
cumbersome O
either O
. O
It O
left O
out O
hair O
very O
manageable O
, O
love O
the O
two O
extensions O
and O
option O
for O
different O
heat O
and O
speed O
settings O
. O
Remington O
makes O
quality O
items O
for O
a O
fair O
price O
. O
We O
like O
it O
. O

This O
is O
an O
extra O
dryer O
we O
use O
upstairs O
after O
the O
kids O
take O
their O
baths O
. O
Ergonomics O
is O
good O
and O
you O
do O
n't O
accidentally O
press O
any O
buttons O
while O
holding O
it O
at O
various O
angles O
. O
  O
The O
fan O
speeds O
are O
powerful O
and O
the O
different O
heat O
settings O
are O
definitely O
appreciated O
. O
  O
Also O
, O
it O
has O
the O
typical O
cool O
- O
shot O
button O
. O
It O
comes O
with O
a O
blade O
- O
diverter O
attachment O
as O
well O
as O
a O
volumizer O
attachment O
. O
The O
length O
of O
the O
cord O
is O
reasonable O
even O
with O
a O
1 O
- O
yr O
old O
running O
around O
. O
The O
weight O
and O
feel O
are O
good O
as O
well O
as O
it O
has O
a O
high O
- O
quality O
feel O
to O
it O
, O
perhaps O
the O
ceramic O
coating O
or O
so O
, O
does O
n't O
feel O
plastic O
- O
y O
at O
all O
. O
  O
We O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
this O
to O
any O
household O
from O
little O
toddlers O
to O
adults O
. O

I O
really O
like O
this O
product O
. O
  O
It O
's O
compact O
, O
but O
powerful O
, O
and O
pretty O
lightweight O
. O
  O
Does O
a O
good O
job O
drying O
my O
fine O
hair O
( O
I O
've O
fine O
hair O
, O
but O
a O
lot O
of O
it O
) O
in O
scant O
minutes O
. O
  O
The O
only O
thing O
it O
is O
n't O
, O
is O
quiet O
, O
but O
they O
do O
n't O
advertise O
it O
as O
such- O
just O
pointing O
it O
out O
though O
. O
  O
I O
'm O
very O
pleased O
with O
it O
. O

When O
I O
first O
received O
this O
I O
absolutely O
loved O
it O
. O
  O
Great O
power O
, O
the O
cord O
was O
sturdy O
and O
extra O
long O
, O
and O
it O
worked O
really O
well O
. O
  O
However O
, O
I O
am O
returning O
it O
for O
a O
refund O
, O
because O
one O
month O
after O
getting O
it O
, O
the O
hi O
- O
lo O
switch O
stopped O
working O
and O
it O
would O
only O
work O
on O
high O
. O
  O
I O
thought O
I O
could O
live O
with O
that O
but O
this O
morning O
when O
I O
was O
using O
it O
the O
switch O
in O
the O
handle O
started O
feeling O
really O
hot O
and O
smoke O
started O
coming O
out O
of O
it O
. O
  O
So O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
was O
just O
a O
fluke O
and O
this O
particular O
one O
was O
defective O
, O
or O
if O
it O
is O
something O
that O
happens O
often O
with O
this O
model O
. O
  O
I O
was O
really O
disappointed O
though O
because O
I O
was O
really O
pleased O
with O
it O
when O
it O
was O
working O
as O
it O
was O
supposed O
to O
. O

With O
the O
exception O
of O
colors O
, O
this O
appears O
to O
be O
the O
same O
as O
an O
earlier O
model O
of O
the O
same O
brand O
I O
owned O
. O
  O
That O
was O
reliable O
for O
several O
years O
until O
slowing O
speed O
required O
replacement O
. O

It O
works O
pretty O
good O
for O
the O
money O
... O

Terrible O
blowdryer O
. O
Scary O
to O
use O
as O
it O
sparks O
. O

Tried O
and O
true O
. O
  O
My O
last O
Conair O
lasted O
15 O
years O
. O
  O
I O
was O
so O
glad O
to O
see O
the O
style O
was O
still O
available O
. O
  O
Compact O
, O
but O
has O
power O
. O

This O
hair O
dryer O
was O
out O
of O
stock O
for O
more O
than O
2 O
months O
. O
I O
even O
tried O
xtava.com O
to O
buy O
this O
hair O
dryer O
but O
to O
no O
avail O
. O
I O
contacted O
their O
customer O
service O
but O
they O
just O
asked O
me O
to O
wait O
so O
I O
waited O
and O
waited O
. O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
buy O
any O
other O
hair O
dryer O
. O
I O
just O
had O
to O
have O
this O
hair O
dryer O
because O
of O
its O
2200W O
power O
and O
nice O
design O
. O
Consequently O
, O
I O
ended O
up O
having O
to O
endure O
the O
life O
of O
no O
hair O
dryer O
for O
nearly O
3 O
months O
. O
But O
, O
after O
using O
this O
hair O
dryer O
today O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O
I O
absolutely O
do O
not O
regret O
the O
long O
wait O
. O

The O
hairdryer O
blows O
air O
very O
softly O
if O
that O
's O
such O
a O
thing O
. O
  O
Needs O
more O
power O
, O
I O
feel O
like O
it O
takes O
longer O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
. O

Birthday O
present O
for O
the O
wife O
after O
she O
used O
one O
at O
a O
hotel O
. O
Drys O
in O
half O
the O
time O
and O
stores O
easily O
. O

This O
dryer O
is O
lightweight O
, O
yet O
has O
a O
quality O
feel O
to O
it O
. O
  O
It O
fits O
your O
hand O
well O
, O
has O
nice O
adjustability O
, O
an O
dries O
your O
hair O
well O
without O
over O
- O
drying O
it O
. O
I O
think O
the O
price O
is O
quite O
reasonable O
too O
. O
  O
Seems O
like O
a O
product O
that O
will O
last O
, O
and O
of O
course O
it O
's O
not O
a O
no O
name O
product O
, O
but O
a O
Remington O
, O
so O
presumably O
the O
quality O
is O
there O
. O
A O
nice O
dryer O
at O
a O
nice O
price O
. O

My O
old O
one O
broke O
down O
after O
only O
about O
20 O
years O
of O
hard O
work O
. O
I O
got O
a O
new O
one O
and O
was O
pleased O
to O
find O
the O
design O
was O
the O
same O
. O
Why O
get O
off O
a O
winner O
. O
Works O
well O
and O
easy O
to O
pack O
. O

Works O
good O
for O
me O
, O
no O
problems O
and O
I O
use O
it O
damn O
near O
everyday O

Does O
the O
job O
, O
but O
not O
what O
I O
expected O
. O

Works O
great O
in O
my O
cottage O
up O
north O
. O
Recommended O
to O
hotel O
& O
motel O
owners O
who O
want O
a O
secure O
way O
to O
provide O
a O
hairdryer O
to O
guests O
, O
without O
losing O
it O
. O

My O
girls O
say O
this O
works O
great O
. O
  O
Much O
better O
than O
their O
old O
one O
. O
  O
Dries O
hair O
fast O
! O

Love O
the O
product O
. O
Very O
fast O
shipping O
. O

I O
really O
like O
this O
product O
. O
The O
cord O
seems O
to O
be O
way O
longer O
than O
what O
I O
am O
used O
to O
. O
I O
really O
like O
the O
tools O
it O
comes O
with O
... O

Good O
functionality O
but O
Too O
heavy O
! O

Installation O
was O
difficult O
. O
  O
A O
small O
plastic O
piece O
cracked O
during O
installation O
, O
which O
caused O
us O
to O
have O
to O
install O
a O
different O
way O
. O
  O
I O
wish O
the O
hair O
dryer O
carrier O
was O
smaller O
. O

I O
have O
both O
straight O
and O
curly O
hair O
( O
blow O
dryer O
+ O
round O
brush O
, O
straight O
. O
A O
little O
curl O
spray O
& O
diffuser O
, O
curly O
) O
, O
so O
I O
've O
owned O
tons O
of O
blow O
dryers O
. O
This O
diffuser O
is O
great O
. O
I O
diffuse O
with O
my O
hair O
upside O
- O
down O
& O
it O
gives O
me O
big O
full O
curls O
. O
Others O
have O
said O
their O
long O
hair O
has O
gotten O
stuck O
in O
it O
& O
that O
has O
n't O
been O
  O
the O
case O
for O
me O
. O
Only O
reason O
I O
gave O
it O
4 O
stars O
& O
not O
5 O
is O
because O
it O
's O
larger O
& O
heavier O
than O
I O
expected O
. O

Love O
this O
dryer O
! O
I O
noticed O
a O
big O
difference O
after O
using O
just O
once O
. O
Hair O
felt O
healthier O
! O

' O
ve O
been O
through O
three O
hair O
dryers O
in O
the O
past O
year O
. O
One O
of O
them O
broke O
after O
a O
short O
fall O
from O
my O
hand O
to O
the O
bathroom O
counter O
( O
seriously O
? O
? O
) O
, O
the O
second O
one O
always O
got O
too O
hot O
and O
stunk O
up O
my O
bathroom O
, O
even O
on O
the O
lowest O
hear O
setting O
( O
grrrr O
... O
) O
And O
then O
there O
was O
the O
Onei O
. O
The O
Onei O
is O
just O
perfect O
! O
I O
really O
like O
that O
is O
has O
an O
ion O
activation O
switch O
in O
the O
handle O
. O
When O
you O
turn O
on O
the O
dryer O
, O
you O
can O
hear O
it O
speed O
and O
warm O
up O
- O
there O
is O
n't O
that O
sudden O
blast O
of O
metal O
smelling O
heat O
like O
the O
cheaper O
dryers O
I O
've O
owned O
. O
I O
definitely O
recommend O
the O
Onei O
to O
anyone O
who O
wants O
a O
quality O
dryer O
. O

Perfect O
& O
light O
weight O
. O

The O
cap O
is O
very O
small O
and O
tight O
. O
I O
had O
to O
take O
it O
off O
after O
10 O
mins O
. O

The O
string O
is O
too O
tight O
around O
the O
head O
. O
I O
wish O
they O
would O
bring O
back O
the O
gold O
bonnet O
one O
back O
. O
I O
had O
to O
settle O
for O
this O
one O
because O
I O
could O
n't O
find O
that O
other O
one O
. O
But O
I O
'm O
not O
a O
real O
fan O
of O
this O
BUT O
it O
still O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
. O

Within O
less O
than O
four O
months O
, O
I O
noticed O
a O
fiery O
red O
glow O
within O
the O
barrel O
and O
had O
to O
stop O
using O
for O
fear O
of O
my O
hair O
catching O
on O
fire O
. O
  O
The O
company O
was O
nice O
enough O
to O
refund O
my O
money O
once O
I O
could O
finally O
get O
hold O
of O
someone O
( O
note O
there O
are O
no O
phone O
numbers O
provided O
with O
the O
dryer O
or O
on O
their O
website O
) O
, O
however O
I O
do O
not O
recommend O
due O
to O
safety O
issues O
. O

Excellent O
product O
! O
Excellent O
customer O

Problems O
using O
with O
uk O
adaptor O

Good O

The O
hose O
and O
bonnet O
  O
does O
not O
  O
stay O
connected O
  O
. O
It O
needs O
to O
have O
  O
way O
to O
lock O
it O
in O
place O
. O

I O
've O
had O
3 O
of O
these O
hair O
druers O
and O
was O
happy O
with O
them O
because O
of O
the O
folding O
feature O
. O
The O
last O
one O
I O
purchased O
through O
Amazon O
stopped O
heating O
correctly O
within O
2 O
weeks O
of O
use O
. O
That O
s O
just O
poor O
.... O

Meh O
, O
it O
just O
does O
n't O
work O
that O
well O
for O
me O
. O
  O
I O
think O
the O
diffuser O
needs O
to O
be O
smaller O
and O
curved O
more O
to O
better O
fit O
the O
shape O
of O
a O
person O
's O
head O
. O
  O
Somehow O
my O
wavy O
curls O
end O
up O
being O
too O
smooshed O
flat O
against O
my O
head O
, O
then O
sticking O
out O
toward O
the O
ends O
. O
  O
Not O
a O
fan O
, O
wish O
i O
had O
n't O
tossed O
the O
box O
. O

It O
was O
ordered O
for O
a O
friend O
whose O
wife O
runs O
a O
beauty O
shop O
and O
he O
says O
it O
working O
fine O

This O
blow O
dryer O
arrived O
compliments O
of O
the O
Vine O
program O
. O
  O
It O
is O
supposed O
to O
dry O
hair O
quickly O
and O
with O
minimal O
frizz O
and O
damage O
. O
  O
I O
found O
the O
drying O
time O
to O
be O
the O
same O
if O
not O
slower O
than O
my O
Conair O
1875 O
blow O
dryer O
. O
  O
The O
rocker O
buttons O
are O
in O
an O
awkward O
thumb O
position O
and O
get O
in O
the O
way O
of O
a O
smooth O
grip O
on O
the O
handle O
. O
  O
Top O
it O
off O
with O
a O
very O
bulky O
and O
weighted O
feel O
and O
you O
have O
a O
dryer O
that O
is O
not O
suitable O
for O
our O
preference O
. O

Solidly O
built O
hair O
dryer O
- O
diffuser O
stays O
on O
and O
does O
n't O
pop O
off O
on O
a O
moment O
's O
notice O
as O
did O
a O
Revlon O
drier O
I O
used O
to O
have O
but O
which O
fell O
apart O
in O
less O
than O
a O
year O
... O
( O
am O
returing O
to O
Bed O
Bath O
Beyond O
) O
nice O
built O
in O
hook O
for O
hanging O
, O
plenty O
powerful O
, O
not O
too O
noisy O
, O
price O
was O
OK O
. O
All O
in O
all O
, O
works O
better O
than O
a O
towell O
and/or O
shaking O
the O

remove O
water O
! O
  O
haha O

The O
retractable O
cord O
rarely O
fully O
retracts O
and O
it O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
get O
as O
hot O
as O
other O
hair O
dryers O
I O
have O
had O
in O
the O
past O

In O
the O
past O
year O
I O
have O
stopped O
blow O
drying O
my O
hair O
straight O
, O
opting O
to O
let O
my O
curls O
be O
free O
. O
I O
love O
that O
this O
dryer O
has O
a O
diffuser O
attachment O
. O
Most O
hair O
dryers O
only O
come O
with O
the O
concentrator O
attachment O
. O
My O
curls O
, O
which O
have O
really O
improved O
since O
quitting O
straightening O
, O
now O
take O
forever O
to O
dry O
, O
since O
my O
hair O
is O
not O
dried O
out O
, O
anymore O
. O
I O
can O
use O
this O
on O
my O
curls O
to O
dry O
them O
quickly O
, O
since O
I O
hate O
leaving O
the O
house O
with O
wet O
hair O
. O
The O
diffuser O
works O
well O
, O
not O
frizzing O
my O
hair O
at O
all O
and O
my O
curls O
are O
bouncier O
than O
when O
they O
air O
dry O
. O
That O
's O
a O
great O
plus O
. O
I O
only O
need O
about O
5 O
minutes O
of O
drying O
time O
to O
achieve O
95 O
% O
dry O
hair O
. O
It O
has O
a O
cool O
shot O
and O
also O
a O
high O
/ O
low O
feature O
. O
This O
dryer O
gets O
very O
hot O
, O
so O
I O
dry O
my O
curls O
on O
the O
medium O
setting O
, O
which O
is O
still O
hot O
. O
The O
higher O
setting O
would O
be O
better O
for O
straightening O
. O

I O
have O
owned O
this O
product O
. O
It O
lasted O
3 O
years O
. O
The O
fan O
blades O
shattered O
into O
pieces O
. O
  O
I O
chose O
to O
replace O
it O
with O
the O
same O
unit O
. O
That O
translates O
into O
$ O
10 O
/yr O
. O
  O
Prior O
to O
the O
Oster O
I O
had O
Sunbeams O
. O
One O
lasted O
8 O
years O
. O
They O
are O
no O
longer O
available O
. O
There O
cost O
was O
2/3'rds O
the O
cost O
of O
the O
Oster O
. O
Where O
are O
the O
economical O
competitors O
? O
Functionally O
, O
the O
latest O
Oster O
is O
much O
improved O
regarding O
sound O
. O
In O
fact O
it O
is O
whisper O
quiet O
by O
comparison O
. O
Overall O
, O
the O
product O
is O
very O
nice O
in O
display O
and O
function O
. O

Best O
blow O
dryer O
ever O
for O
my O
wild O
curls O
. O
I O
used O
to O
have O
to O
live O
the O
house O
with O
wet O
hair O
and O
hope O
for O
the O
best O
- O
not O
anymore O
! O
The O
speed O
and O
heat O
settings O
make O
it O
super O
easy O
to O
tame O
the O
frizz O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
at O
a O
local O
store O
and O
it O
was O
fine O
for O
a O
while O
( O
other O
than O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
off O
/ O
low O
/ O
high O
switch O
was O
difficult O
to O
move O
) O
, O
but O
then O
one O
day O
turned O
it O
on O
and O
I O
noticed O
it O
did O
n't O
sound O
as O
loud O
and O
found O
that O
it O
was O
n't O
heating O
up O
at O
all O
and O
there O
was O
just O
a O
bit O
of O
cool O
air O
blowing O
out O
. O
  O
This O
was O
less O
than O
six O
months O
after O
purchasing O
. O

I O
love O
the O
price O

like O
it O

I O
had O
this O
one O
for O
over O
3 O
years O
and O
it O
worked O
great O
. O
  O
It O
just O
recently O
died O
and O
I O
bought O
the O
exact O
same O
model O
. O
  O
The O
retractable O
cord O
is O
so O
nice O
! O

I O
rarely O
use O
a O
hair O
dryer O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
but O
lately O
, O
I O
am O
tired O
of O
waiting O
for O
it O
to O
air O
dry O
. O
  O

that O
happens O
, O

review O
- O
   O
Been O
over O
a O
year O
, O
love O
this O
thing O
, O
has O
different O
heat O
settings O
and O
attachments O
, O
is O
yeah O
and O
it O
's O
cute O
to O
boot O

I O
've O
had O
my O
wall O
mounted O
Oster O
for O
over O
20 O
years O
. O
  O
It O
is O
starting O
to O
smell O
so O
I O
am O
now O
looking O
for O
a O
new O
one O
. O
  O
I O
only O
had O
to O
clean O
it O
once O
. O
  O
Mine O
only O
has O
1200 O
  O
watts O
, O
but O
I O
have O
always O
had O
short O
hair O
so O
that O
may O
have O
made O
a O
difference O
for O
the O
long O
length O
of O
time O
I O
've O
owned O
it O
. O
  O
But O
I O
have O
loved O
it O
since O
I O
bought O
it O
and O
I O
use O
it O
every O
day O
since O
I O
wash O
my O
hair O
  O
when O
I O
shower O
every O
morning O
before O
leaving O
for O
work O
. O

I O
use O
this O
on O
my O
dog O
after O
I O
give O
her O
a O
bath O
. O
Great O

The O
drying O
speed O
is O
actually O
no O
faster O
than O
my O
$ O
20 O
1350W O
hair O
dryer O
. O
The O
quick O
dry O
head O
dries O
even O
slower O
than O
the O
precise O
dry O
head O
. O
And O
in O
my O
opinion O
the O
dryer O
is O
HEAVY O
. O
But O
my O
hair O
does O
feel O
much O
smoother O
than O
before O
. O
It O
does O
its O
job O
to O
retain O
the O
moisture O
of O
my O
hair O
. O

This O
is O
the O
second O
blower O
I O
've O
owned O
! O
I O
almost O
went O
for O
the O
newer O
style O
... O
so O
glad O
I O
did O
n't O
! O
I O
just O
love O
this O
model O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
I O
'll O
ever O
look O
to O
change O
! O
It O
's O
a O
great O
, O
reliable O
blower O
and O
the O
power O
behind O
this O
puppy O
is O
awesome O
! O
I O
tend O
to O
have O
frizzy O
hair O
, O
so O
I O
need O
a O
good O
blower O
to O
smooth O
it O
out O
! O
This O
is O
the O
perfect O
choice O
to O
remedy O
this O
hair O
type O
! O
:-) O

excellent O
product O
, O
what O
I O
asked O
was O
what O
got O
me O

I O
just O
signed O
in O
to O
find O
when O
I O
ordered O
this O
and O
it O
was O
last O
October O
. O
It O
has O
worked O
fine O
until O
it O
began O
having O
little O
sparks O
in O
last O
couple O
of O
days O
internally O
. O
Would O
not O
recommend O
this O
because O
of O
that O
hazard O
and O
only O
getting O
less O
than O
1 O
year O
out O
of O
it O
. O

Great O
hair O
dryer O
. O
It O
is O
less O
noisy O
that O
my O
other O
hair O
dryer O
. O
Beautiful O
finish O
! O
! O
! O

really O
good O
to O
use O

I O
bought O
this O
keeping O
in O
mind O
that O
the O
cool O
shot O
button O
may O
not O
work O
after O
reading O
a O
review O
. O
I O
blow O
dry O
my O
hair O
at O
most O
3 O
times O
for O
the O
year O
so O
for O
me O
it O
does O
the O
job O
. O
I O
use O
the O
cool O
setting O
which O
still O
feels O
a O
little O
warm O
to O
me O
but O
it O
helps O
to O
stretch O
my O
hair O
very O
well O
but O
without O
the O
heat O
damage O
( O
I O
still O
use O
heat O
protectant O
though O
) O
. O
But O
.. O
the O
cool O
shot O
button O
DEFINITELY O
DOESN'T O
WORK O

Fine O
product O
wish O
I O
had O
one O
years O
ago O
. O

This O
item O
is O
pink O
and O
it O
is O
not O
clearly O
advertised O
as O
such O
. O

I O
've O
been O
using O
this O
for O
a O
few O
months O
now O
and O
I O
..... O
love O
it O
^_^ O
! O
Its O
does O
a O
great O
job O
, O
I O
always O
use O
the O
cool O
setting O
and O
you O
know O
what O
it O
stays O
cool O
. O
Unlike O
other O
dryers O
that O
you O
have O
to O
keep O
holding O
a O
button O
, O
this O
one O
has O
a O
low O
temp O
setting O
that O
remain O
moderately O
temperature O
. O
The O
burst O
of O
cool O
air O
button O
gets O
even O
cooler O
. O
That O
s O
what O
I O
really O
like O
about O
this O
dryer O
along O
with O
the O
slim O
design O
is O
very O
cool O
. O
Okay O
enough O
with O
the O
cool O
XD O
Its O
a O
great O
product O
, O
you O
wo O
n't O
be O
disappointed O
. O

Love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
For O
years O
, O
I O
had O
a O
terrible O
old O
dryer O
that O
would O
n't O
die O
. O
When O
it O
finally O
did O
, O
I O
was O
worried O
that O
anything O
new O
I O
got O
would O
be O
junky O
like O
so O
many O
electronics O
these O
days O
. O
I O
have O
had O
this O
hair O
dryer O
for O
about O
a O
year O
now O
and O
still O
love O
it O
as O
much O
as O
I O
did O
the O
day O
I O
got O
it O
. O
It O
dries O
really O
fast O
without O
being O
too O
hot O
to O
damage O
my O
hair O
. O
It O
has O
a O
satiny O
finish O
that O
feels O
nice O
in O
your O
hand O
too O
. O

My O
hair O
dryer O
broke O
and O
I O
needed O
a O
replacement O
. O
  O
I O
keep O
my O
hair O
dryer O
plugged O
in O
by O
my O
sink O
and O
I O
worried O
about O
my O
grandkids O
accidentally O
dropping O
it O
in O
the O
sink O
so O
I O
bought O
this O
wall O
mounted O
unit O
. O
  O
I O
absolutely O
love O
it O
. O
  O
So O
convenient O
and O
it O
's O
more O
powerful O
than O
my O
old O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
I O
may O
get O
another O
one O
for O
the O
other O
bathroom O
. O

I O
've O
had O
this O
blow O
dryer O
for O
a O
year O
or O
so O
and O
I O
love O
it O
. O
I O
have O
n't O
had O
to O
replace O
it O

I O
really O
like O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
It O
dries O
my O
hair O
quickly O
& O
thoroughly O
, O
even O
though O
just O
a O
little O
heavy O
. O
Excellent O
product O
& O
highly O
recommended O

I O
like O
it O
. O

Ordered O
this O
and O
upon O
arrival O
the O
dryer O
stopped O
working O
. O
It O
would O
turn O
on O
and O
work O
for O
a O
few O
seconds O
and O
then O
overheat O
. O
Not O
pleased O
with O
this O
purchase O
. O
I O
have O
used O
similar O
Andis O
dryers O
in O
the O
past O
without O
problem O
, O
this O
one O
was O
a O
dud O
. O

great O

THIS O

IS O
THE O

very O
curly O

I O
DRY O
MY O

BY O
HOLDING O
THE O

CLOSE O

THE O
SCALP O
, O
AND O
SQUISHING O
THE O

DIFFUSER O
. O
AFTER O
ABOUT O
6 O
minutes O
my O
hair O
is O
completely O
dry O
. O
THEN O
I O
MASSAGE O
MY O

BUT O
I O
NEVER O
PUT O
MY O
HANDS O
THROUGH O
THE O

IT O

THE O
PIXIE O
METHOD O
OF O
DRYING O

I O
NEVER O
HAVE O
A O
BAD O

After O

crapped O
out O
on O
me O
after O
like O
4 O
months O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
just O
look O
for O
a O
hair O

automatic O

.... O

great O
, O
just O
follow O
the O
directions O
..... O
Very O
satisfied O
with O
this O
dryer O
. O

I O
am O
58 O
years O
old O
and O
have O
mid O
- O
length O
, O
medium O
texture O
, O
slightly O
wavy O
hair O
. O
For O
the O
past O
15 O
years O
I O
have O
been O
using O
the O
same O
Conair O
hairdryer O
( O
it O
just O
will O
not O
die O
) O
an O
average O
of O
2 O
- O
3x O
a O
week O
and O
over O
that O
time O
have O
had O
my O
share O
of O
good O
hair O
days O
and O
bad O
. O
Recently O
, O
I O
've O
noticed O
that O
my O
hair O
has O
been O
getting O
very O
dry O
- O
even O
in O
the O
summer O
which O
is O
very O
unusual O
. O
So O
, O
after O
trying O
various O
shampoos O
with O
not O
much O
difference O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
Google O
' O
dry O
hair O
' O
and O
low O
and O
behold O
, O
hair O
dryers O
popped O
up O
! O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
I O
would O
have O
come O
up O
with O
that O
on O
my O
own O
, O
so O
of O
course O
I O
then O
started O
researching O
hair O
dryers O
. O
There O
are O
about O
as O
many O
' O
Top O
Ten O
Hair O
Dryer O
' O
lists O
as O
I O
think O
there O
are O
hair O
dryers O
! O
While O
there O
are O
a O
couple O
of O
( O
pricey O
) O
brands O
that O
tend O
to O
show O
up O
on O
most O
of O
those O
lists O
, O
I O
finally O
decided O
to O
look O
at O
it O
a O
different O
way O
ie O
: O
what O
' O
technologies O
' O
exist O
and O
what O
would O
work O
best O
with O
my O
hair O
. O
I O
like O
a O
lot O
of O
volume O
and O
smoothness O
, O
so O
ionic O
, O
ceramic O
, O
tourmaline O
with O
infra O
red O
seemed O
to O
fit O
the O
bill O
- O
which O
is O
everything O
this O
dryer O
has O
. O
I O
read O
pretty O
much O
all O
of O
the O
reviews O
, O
watched O
the O
YouTube O
videos O
and O
even O
tho O
' O
people O
complained O
about O
the O
weight O
and O
button O
positions O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
give O
it O
a O
try O
. O
Well O
, O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
am O
literally O
blown O
away O
! O
First O
, O
I O
understand O
why O
people O
complain O
about O
the O
button O
position O
as O
the O
first O
time O
I O
used O
it O
, O
I O
also O
kept O
changing O
speed O
and O
heat O
settings O
. O
However O
, O
it O
took O
me O
no O
time O
at O
all O
to O
figure O
out O
how O
to O
hold O
it O
so O
that O
does O
n't O
happen O
. O
The O
heat O
levels O
are O
nice O
and O
consistent O
and O
the O
Cool O
Shot O
button O
works O
great O
- O
does O
n't O
' O
lock O
' O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
care O
as O
I O
just O
shoot O
the O
roots O
before O
I O
finish O
each O
section O
so O
works O
fine O
for O
me O
. O
Regarding O
the O
weight O
, O
that O
was O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
I O
was O
a O
bit O
concerned O
about O
at O
first O
, O
since O
my O
old O
dryer O
was O
super O
light O
. O
  O
Now O
, O
after O
using O
it O
for O
the O
second O
time O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
even O
notice O
the O
weight O
, O
only O
the O
incredibly O
awesome O
results O
it O
produces O
! O
I O
actually O
feel O
like O
I O
have O
new O
hair O
as O
it O
is O
no O
longer O
dry O
and O
frizzy O
but O
instead O
is O
super O
smooth O
, O
soft O
and O
bouncy O
. O
I O
still O
ca O
n't O
believe O
changing O
hair O
dryers O
could O
make O
such O
a O
difference O
. O
I O
actually O
look O
forward O
to O
doing O
my O
hair O
now O
! O
My O
recommendation O
is O
, O
do O
your O
research O
, O
but O
if O
you O
have O
hair O
similar O
to O
mine O
, O
give O
this O
fantastic O
dryer O
a O

stuck O
to O
my O
head O
to O
try O
to O
dry O
my O

I O
found O
it O

much O
easier O

less O
fuzzier O
to O
apply O
product O
and O
let O
the O
hair O

I O

based O
on O
Amazon O

It O

now O
no O

any O

pressure O
and O
takes O
at O
least O
2x O
as O
long O

. O
The O
return O

one O

now O
I O
need O
to O
purchase O
another O
new O
hair O

. O
Very O
displeased O
with O
this O
purchase O
. O

good O
unit O
. O
a O
little O
pricey O
but O
i O
was O
replacing O
a O
7 O
or O
8 O
year O
old O
like O
unit O
so O
i O
did O
not O
want O
to O
change O
unit O
or O
mounting O
system O
. O

Low O
setting O
is O
to O
strong O
and O
to O
fast O
also O
the O

is O
too O
heavy O

Not O

. O
  O
Easy O

I O
bought O
this O
dryer O
for O
my O
girlfriend O
for O
her O
birthday O
last O

because O
she O
is O
always O
complaining O
about O
getting O
her O
hair O
done O
and O
how O
much O
people O
charge O
her O
( O
which O
I O
end O
up O
paying O
for O

) O
so O
I O
thought O
what O
better O
thing O
to O
buy O
her O
for O
her O
birthday O
than O
something O
she O
can O

forever O

She O
loves O
this O
hair O
dryer O
, O
she O
puts O
her O
hair O
in O
rollers O
and O
sits O
under O
. O
It O
gets O
very O
hot O
too O
! O
Thanks O
for O
the O
great O
buy O
! O

VIDEOID:3ce786db72a405f72c6e511ec156f72d]]I O
have O
needed O
a O
hair O
dryer O
forever O
and O
finally O
got O
this O
one O
. O
I O
am O
so O
happy O
because O
the O
vent O
on O
my O
old O
one O
was O
sucking O
my O
hair O
inside O
and O
I O
would O
have O
to O
break O
by O
hair O
to O
get O
it O
out O
. O
This O
hairdryer O
is O
very O
nice O
and O
durably O
constructed O
. O
It O
feels O
substantial O
in O
my O
hands O
, O
not O
flimsy O
and O
cheap O
. O
It O
comes O
with O
2 O
diffuser O
type O
attachments O
that O
connects O
easily O
and O
stay O
in O
place O
until O
you O
take O
them O
off O
. O
The O
cord O
on O
this O
hairdryer O
is O
super O
long O
so O
I O
can O
move O
around O
quite O
a O
bit O
while O
drying O
my O
hair O
. O
There O
is O
also O
a O
loop O
built O
in O
the O
handle O
so O
this O
hair O
dryer O
can O
be O
hung O
up O
for O
storage O
purposes O
. O
The O
hairdryer O
itself O
has O
a O
cool O
shot O
button O
which O
you O
hold O
down O
if O
you O
want O
cool O
air O
to O
blow O
out O
. O
There O
is O
another O
button O
that O
changes O
the O
forcefulness O
of O
the O
air O
that O
is O
blowing O
out O
( O
this O
one O
has O
2 O
settings O
) O
. O
The O
last O
button O
is O
high O
, O
medium O
and O
low O
for O
the O
warmth O
of O
the O
heat O
that O
will O
blow O
out O
of O
the O
hair O
dryer O
. O
This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
1875 O
watts O
so O
it O
is O
pretty O
powerful O
and O
it O
dries O
my O
hair O
pretty O
quickly O
. O
The O
infrared O
light O
actually O
is O
an O
orange O
red O
color O
and O
it O
helps O
to O
reduce O
static O
and O
frizz O
. O
I O
am O
very O
impressed O
with O
this O
hair O
dryer O
and O
I O
wish O
I O
would O
have O
gotten O
it O
sooner O
. O
I O
received O
this O
product O

Excellent O

Comb O
breaks O
easily O
, O
a O
little O
hard O
to O
old O
without O
touching O
all O
the O

I O
've O
had O
this O
for O
a O
couple O
years O
. O
It O
's O
been O
very O
good O

The O
cord O
is O
a O
little O
short O

it O

. O
Cord O
is O
average O
wish O
it O
was O
longer O
as O
this O
feels O
more O
like O
a O
professional O
blower O
. O
Love O
the O
feel O
of O
the O
blower O
too O
it O
does O
n't O
slide O
out O
of O
your O
hands O
and O
it O
's O
not O
very O
heavy O
. O

Love O
it O
. O
It O
is O
very O
powerful O
hair O
dryer O
. O
I O
like O
it O
because O
it O
also O
folds O
up O
& O
takes O
less O
space O

had O
difficulty O
with O
switches O
due O
to O
reduced O
mobility O
of O
my O
hands O
. O
no O
problem O
with O
any O
other O
features O

Way O
better O
quality O
than O
I O
expected O
for O
the O
price O
! O
Love O
it O
! O
! O

Exactly O
what O
I O
wanted O
. O
Great O
price O

Retracting O
cord O
a O
little O
hard O
to O
get O
use O
to O
. O
Do O
n't O
retract O
it O
most O
of O
the O
time O
. O

It O
's O
ok O
. O

The O
dryer O
itself O
works O
great O
, O
but O
the O
attachments O
do O
n't O
stay O
on O
. O
I O
was O
spending O
more O
time O
picking O
the O
attachments O
up O
off O
the O
floor O
than O
drying O
my O
hair O
, O
really O
a O
piss O
poor O
design O
very O
frustrating O

Good O

! O

Works O
great O
! O

Great O
stand O
. O
Movable O
. O
Good O
performance O
for O
the O
price O
I O
paid O
. O
Not O
as O
hot O
as O
salon O
dryers O
. O

Perfect O
! O

Great O
dryer O
. O
Dries O
quickly O
, O
love O
the O
different O
temperature O
settings O
. O
It O
is O
a O
little O
heavier O
than O
I O
expected O
, O
but O
so O
far O
, O
so O
good O
! O

Love O
this O
blow O
dryer O

works O
well O
. O
  O
Just O
as O
good O
as O
a O
$ O
200.00 O
unit O

good O

This O
is O
absolutely O
the O
best O
thing O
I O
've O
ever O
brought O
on O
Amazon O
and O
I O
've O
brought O
a O
lot O
of O
stuff O
. O
The O
only O
reason O
why O
I O
gave O
it O
3 O
stars O
is O
because O
it O
takes O
a O
little O
longer O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
than O
the O
salon O
but O
I O
will O
take O
that O
extra O
30 O
mins O
saving O
$ O
60 O
a O
week O
going O
to O
the O
salon O
. O
I O
have O
Malaysian O
hair O
sew O
in O
, O
I O
usually O
go O
to O
the O
salon O
every O
week O
for O
a O
roller O
wrap O
or O
some O
wand O
curls O
but O
I O
will O
never O
ever O
go O
back O
to O
the O
salon O
again O
unless O
I O
'm O
going O
for O
a O
sew O
in O
. O
My O
curls O
come O
out O
so O
bouncy O
and O
pretty O
. O
I O
look O
like O
I O
just O
stepped O
out O
of O
a O
salon O
. O
The O
dryer O
was O
easy O
to O
assemble O
and O
it O
's O
better O
being O
in O
the O
comfort O
of O
my O
own O
home O

Good O
product O
and O
quite O
! O

Great O

This O
one O
replaced O
the O
last O
Remington O
that O
I O
had O
( O
and O
loved O
) O
since O
2002 O
! O
I O
have O
very O
long O
hair O
that O
's O
color O
treated O
, O
and O
these O
types O
of O
hair O
dryers O
are O
a O
life O
saver O
. O
  O
I O
hope O
this O
one O
lasts O
13 O
years O
... O
added O
bonus O
... O
it O
matches O
my O
purple O
- O
accented O
bathroom O
. O
  O
:) O

Bought O
this O
for O
my O
sister O
in O
law O
and O
she O
was O
very O
happy O

This O
is O
NOT O
a O
true O
diffuser O
. O
A O
real O
diffuser O
does O
not O
blow O
your O
hair O
; O
it O
heats O
your O
hair O
. O
  O
This O
blows O
your O
hair O
like O
a O
regular O
blow O
dryer O
. O
I O
returned O
it O
after O
a O
few O
tries O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
because O
the O
sidewalks O
at O
my O
workplace O
are O
very O
uneven O
, O
and O
every O
time O
it O
rains O
we O
get O
huge O
puddles O
that O
can O
not O
be O
avoided O
. O
My O
shoes O
always O
get O
drenched O
, O
and O
I O
needed O
a O
way O
to O
quickly O
and O
easily O
dry O
them O
. O
For O
that O
purpose O
, O
I O
've O
found O
this O
hair O
dryer O
to O
be O
very O
useful O
and O
efficient O
. O
I O
also O
use O
it O
to O
warm O
my O
socks O
in O
the O
winter O
. O
There O
's O
no O
better O
feeling O
than O
being O
out O
in O
the O
cold O
with O
warm O
feet O
. O
I O
ca O
n't O
speak O
to O
its O
intended O
purpose O
, O
as O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
hair O
and O
so O
have O
not O
used O
it O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
. O
Please O
do O
n't O
hold O
this O
against O
me O
. O

muy O
bueno O
. O

Only O
used O
it O
for O
2 O
weeks O
. O
The O
bottom O
piece O
would O
get O
too O
hot O
! O
I O
got O
burned O
a O
couple O
times O
and O
it O
also O
melted O
my O
extension O
cord O
because O
of O
the O
heat O
. O
Total O
disappointment O
! O

BEFORE O
BUYING O
THIS O
ITEM O
, O
PLEASE O
READ O
THIS O
REVIEW O
! O
IT O
COULD O
SAVE O
YOU O
FROM O
BEING O
BUYING O
A O
DEFECTIVE O
ITEM O
THAT O
COULD O
BURN O
YOU!When O
I O
opened O
up O
the O
package O
, O
the O
packing O
for O
the O
blow O
- O
dryer O
was O
bent O
and O
looked O
open O
. O
Despite O
that O
, O
I O
thought O
maybe O
it O
just O
got O
damaged O
from O
shipping O
. O
When O
I O
opened O
up O
the O
package O
, O
it O
looked O
used O
. O
The O
blowdryer O
itself O
and O
the O
attachments O
( O
especially O
the O
diffuser O
) O
were O
all O
scratched O
; O
almost O
like O
they O
were O
used O
. O
Still O
, O
I O
thought O
, O
Maybe O
this O
was O
just O
a O
packaging O
issue O
and O
got O
damaged O
via O
UPS O
or O
during O
the O
shipping O
process O
. O
I O
wanted O
to O
test O
out O
the O
product O
before O
returning O
it O
. O
I O
severely O
regret O
even O
trying O
out O
this O
item O
before O
returning O
it O
. O
I O
plugged O
in O
the O
blow O
- O
dryer O
and O
attached O
the O
diffuser O
attachment O
. O
It O
did O
n't O
seem O
to O
blow O
air O
very O
well O
at O
all O
. O
My O
$ O
25 O
Conair O
blow O
- O
dryer O
actually O
blows O
out O
more O
air O
than O
this O
did O
! O
I O
only O
had O
the O
blow O
- O
dryer O
plugged O
in O
for O
maybe O
a O
minute O
and O
realized O
it O
just O
did O
n't O
work O
. O
I O
actually O
got O
burnt O
because O
the O
diffuser O
got O
so O
hot O
! O
I O
now O
have O
a O
little O
welt O
on O
me O
from O
accidentally O
touching O
it O
. O
I O
can O
easily O
seeing O
this O
blow O
- O
dryer O
causing O
a O
fire O
or O
really O
harming O
somebody O
! O
I O
will O
never O
buy O
a O
' O
Pro O

Tools O
' O
item O
again O
. O
The O
fact O
that O
this O
item O
was O
even O
labeled O
as O
a O
professional O
, O
blow O
- O
dryer O
is O
a O
joke O
. O
It O
blows O
no O
air O
and O
is O
cheaply O
made O
. O
The O
supposed O
$ O
150 O
value O
is O
a O
joke O
, O
as O
well O
. O
Like O
I O
said O
, O
my O
$ O
25 O
Conair O
blow O

is O
much O
, O
much O
better O
than O
this O
joke O
of O
a O
dryerNow O
I O
have O
no O
blow O
- O
dryer O
, O
a O
mini O
welt O
and O
irritated O
skin O
. O
Save O
your O
time O
, O
physical O
health O
and O
money O
and O
buy O
something O
else O
. O
Like O
I O
said O
, O
I O
can O
really O
see O
this O
endangering O
somebody O
-- O
whether O
by O
burning O
them O
severely O
( O
I O
was O
n't O
even O
using O
the O
dryer O
for O
2 O
minutes O
before O
becoming O
burnt O
) O
or O
causing O
a O
fire O
of O
some O
sort O
. O
The O
diffuser O
attachment O
also O
stayed O
hot O
for O
quite O
awhile O
which O
I O
've O
never O
seen O
before O
with O
a O
blow O
- O
dryer O
before O
. O

great O
! O
! O
! O

I O
bought O
this O
hair O
dryer O
because O
my O
last O
one O
finally O
died O
after O
about O
5 O
years O
. O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
something O
inexpensive O
and O
high O
quality O
, O
which O
often O
does O
n't O
go O
together O
. O
The O
good O
: O
For O
the O
most O
part O
, O
this O
dryer O
does O
exactly O
what O
it O
says O
it O
will O
. O
It O
dried O
my O
hair O
slightly O
faster O
than O
my O
previous O
dryer O
, O
and O
left O
it O
frizz O
free O
. O
I O
have O
very O
fine O
hair O
, O
so O
it O
almost O
always O
gets O
poofy O
. O
The O
tapered O
end O
made O
it O
easier O
to O
target O
the O
air O
to O
the O
rolling O
brush O
, O
which O
makes O
a O
big O
difference O
when O
compared O
to O
a O
snub O
nosed O
dryer O
( O
those O
are O
n't O
professional O
beauty O
terms O
, O
just O
the O
best O
words O
I O
can O
think O
of O
to O
describe O
the O
product O
) O
. O
It O
's O
a O
decent O
size O
and O
easy O
to O
store O
. O
The O
motor O
is O
VERY O
quiet O
compared O
to O
other O
hair O
dryers O
I O
've O
used O
. O
My O
boyfriend O
gets O
up O
an O
hour O
later O
than O
I O
do O
for O
work O
, O
and O
he O
definitely O
appreciates O
the O
quiet O
motor O
. O
The O
bad O
: O
Just O
an O
aesthetic O
thing O
, O
it O
smells O
weird O
. O
To O
be O
fair O
, O
it O
's O
brand O
new O
so O
it O
's O
probably O
the O
smell O
from O
the O
packaging O
; O
but O
it O
also O
produces O
a O
faint O
odor O
when O
the O
motor O
runs O
that O
reminds O
me O
of O
like O
a O
toy O
blow O
dryer O
. O
I O
'll O
update O
the O
review O
if O
the O
smell O
goes O
away O
. O
For O
it O
's O
average O
size O
, O
it O
's O
fairly O
heavy O
. O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
if O
it O
's O
because O
a O
larger O
motor O
, O
heavier O
materials O
, O
etc O
. O
I O
was O
using O
it O
for O
about O
10 O
mins O
and O
my O
arm O
started O
to O
get O
sore O
! O
It O
's O
not O
insanely O
heavy O
, O
definitely O
manageable O
, O
but O
I O
would O
give O
it O
a O
higher O
ranking O
if O
it O
was O
a O
lighter O
and O
easier O
to O
hold O
. O
Also O
, O
the O
controls O
operate O
opposite O
any O
dryer O
I O
've O
ever O
had O
. O
So O
, O
instead O
of O
sliding O
the O
control O
up O
to O
get O
a O
faster O
speed O
or O
hotter O
temp O
, O
you O
slide O
down O
. O
That O
has O
definitely O
taken O
some O
getting O
used O
to O
. O
Finally O
, O
the O
attachments O
are O
just O
OK O
. O
They O
connect O
to O
the O
dryer O
well O
, O
but O
if O
you O
're O
like O
me O
, O

I O

This O

the O

I O
have O
thick O
curly O

that O
usually O
takes O
an O
hour O

This O

THE O
WORST O
HAIR O
DRYER O
EVER O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
I O
bough O
just O
6 O
months O
ago O
and O
it O
started O
to O
have O
a O
weird O
noise O
and O
was O
not O
working O
well O
and O
the O
next O
time O
I O
tried O
to O
use O
it O
the O
cable O
exploded O
in O
FIRE O
, O
burned O
my O
hand O
and O
almost O
caused O
a O
fire O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O

I O
have O
never O
had O
a O
blow O
dryer O
this O
amazing O
before O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
even O
know O
where O
to O
begin O
. O
  O
The O
first O
thing O
I O
noticed O
was O
this O
blow O
dryer O
is O
a O
little O
heavier O
than O
my O
current O
blow O
dryer O
.... O
I O
guess O
that O
's O
what O
it O
takes O
to O
be O
such O
a O
phenomenal O
blow O
dryer O
! O
It O
's O
not O
so O
heavy O
that O
you O
wo O
n't O
want O
to O
use O
it O
, O
and O
it O
's O
surprisingly O
compact O
. O
You O
get O
two O
attachments O
, O
a O
concentrator O
nozzle O
, O
which O
if O
you O
've O
never O
used O
one O
before O
is O
amazing O
for O
keeping O
your O
hair O
smooth O
and O
silky O
. O
  O
You O
get O
a O
finger O
diffuser O
as O
well O
; O
which O
is O
great O
for O
curly O
hair O
or O
waves O
without O
the O
frizz O
. O
  O
I O
've O
never O
been O
able O
to O
blow O
dry O
my O
hair O
and O
get O
curls O
that O
I O
love O
up O
until O
now O
. O
  O
Normally O
my O
hair O
is O
a O
big O
ball O
of O
frizz O
after O
blowdrying O
it O
, O
but O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
frizz O
free O
curls O
with O
the O
help O
of O
this O
diffuser O
. O
I O
straighten O
my O
hair O
frequently O
and O
for O
the O
longest O
time O
I O
had O
to O
let O
my O
hair O
dry O
overnight O
because O
blow O
drying O
my O
hair O
would O
just O
cause O
it O
to O
frizz O
and O
even O
using O
a O
straightener O
would O
n't O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
frizz O
. O
  O
Now O
I O
just O
use O
the O
concentrator O
nozzle O
and O
it O
really O
helps O
keep O
the O
frizz O
at O
bay O
when O
I O
want O
to O
blow O
dry O
it O
straight O
. O
  O
Quite O
possibly O
my O
favorite O
thing O
about O
this O
blow O
dryer O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
not O
only O
does O
it O
have O
a O
cool O
shot O
button O
, O
it O
has O
a O
COOL O
setting O
, O
I O
have O
A O
LOT O
of O
hair O
and O
holding O
down O
that O
cool O
shot O
button O
for O
my O
whole O
hair O
can O
be O
a O
pain O
, O
now O
I O
can O
just O
switch O
it O
to O
the O
cool O
setting O
. O
Overall O
, O
I O
love O
this O
blow O
dryer O
, O
it O
's O
the O
best O
one O
I O
've O
ever O
owned O
. O
I O
received O
this O
product O
for O
free O
in O
exchange O
for O
my O
honest O
, O
unbiased O
review O
. O

Like O
it O
but O
not O
too O
much O

Perhaps O
it O
's O
strange O
coming O
from O
me O
, O
but O
I O
've O
purchased O
2 O
of O
these O
and O
it O
's O
still O
my O
favorite O
blow O
dryer!I O
used O
this O
dryer O
for O
more O
than O
4 O
years O
and O
never O
had O
a O
problem O
. O
I O
purchased O
a O
second O
one O
because O
I O
gave O
the O
first O
one O
to O
my O
fiance O
' O
, O
who O
lives O
in O
Japan!Her O
mom O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
it O
, O
did O
n't O
bring O
it O
to O
the O
States O
so O
I O
had O
to O
buy O
yet O
another O
ConAir O
blow O
dryer O
:) O
.But O
now O
she O
has O
my O
second O
one O
, O
and O
wo O
n't O
accept O
the O
ConAir O
Infiniti O
Pro O
I O
bought O
for O
her O
. O
Too O
bad O
, O
because O
I O
miss O
my O
cordless O
action O
:( O
But O
I O
can O
still O
blow O
dry O
my O
hair O
after O
taking O
the O
braids O
out O
, O
because O
this O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
dryer O
ever O
. O

A O
great O
item O
to O
have O
when O
traveling O
to O
Europe O
because O
of O
its O
dual O
voltage O
capability O
. O
Easy O
to O
use O
. O
Convenient O
to O
carry O
. O

This O
unit O
caught O
on O
fire O
within O
3 O
months O
of O
purchase O

It O
does O
the O
job O
but O
fan O
makes O
a O
funny O
noise O
when O
powering O
down O
. O

This O
is O
the O
best O
hair O
dryer O
I O
have O
ever O
purchased O
. O
It O
provides O
tons O
of O
power O
and O
is O
n't O
loud O
. O
It O
dries O
my O
hair O
quickly O
and O
does O
n't O
hsve O
shutting O
off O
issues O
like O
other O
dryers O
I O
have O
used O
. O
The O
bed O
head O
brand O
seems O
to O
be O
experts O
in O
their O
field O
and O
make O
products O
that O
work O
well O
and O
hold O
up O
well O
. O
They O
last O
a O
long O
time O
and O
I O
have O
no O
complaints O
. O

Good O
hair O
dryer O
for O
the O
price O
! O
thank O
you O
! O

I O
did O
like O
this O
product O
but O
it O
was O
missing O
pieces O
when O
I O
got O
it O
. O
I O
could O
n't O
hang O
it O
up O
or O
keep O
it O
together O
. O
I O
am O
debating O
ordering O
another O
one O
because O
I O
really O
want O
to O
use O
it O
, O
just O
hope O
the O
next O
time O
it O
arrives O
complete O
. O
If O
it O
did O
n't O
have O
those O
missing O
pieces O
it O
would O
have O
worked O
well O
. O

Does O
the O
job O
at O
an O
unbeatable O
price O
! O
I O
have O
very O
thick O
Romanian O
long O
straight O
hair O
and O
this O
dries O
my O
hair O
well O
and O
pretty O
fast O
. O
Great O
product O
and O
would O
buy O
again O
if O
I O
had O
to O
. O

Just O
does O
not O
get O
hot O
enough O

Bought O

for O
my O
daughter O

Works O
great O
  O
and O
she O
likes O
it O

More O
power O
than O
expected O
. O

Works O
great O
for O
its O
intended O
use O
, O
especially O
for O
how O
small O
it O
is O
! O

My O
old O
blow O
dryer O
was O
this O
exact O
model O
and O
I O
absolutely O
loved O
it O
. O
However O
, O
the O
one O
that O
came O
in O
from O
Amazon O
for O
this O
purchase O
disappointed O
me O
as O
the O
retractable O
cord O
does O
n't O
work O
. O

Love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
! O
! O
! O
  O
It O
gets O
hot O
enough O
and O
blows O
hard O

your O
hair O
quickly O
! O
! O

teenage O
girls O
with O
long O
hair O

! O
  O
It O

! O
! O

Powerful O
yet O
compact O
hair O
dryer O
. O
Works O
really O
well O
! O

This O
is O
the O
absolute O
best O
blow O
dryer O
I O
have O
ever O
owned O
and O
I O
have O
owned O
many O
over O
the O
last O
45 O
years O
. O

My O
favorite O
so O
far O
. O
Takes O
less O
time O
to O
dry O
and O
is O
quiet O
. O
My O
original O
one O
stopped O
working O
after O
about O
1 O
1/2 O
year O
, O
they O
sent O
me O
a O
replacement O
right O
away O
. O
I O
had O
the O
new O
one O
in O
2 O
days O
! O

Great O
purchase O
, O
great O
product O
, O
very O
fast O
shipment- O
love O
it O

Have O
had O
mine O
for O
several O
years O
and O
am O
thinking O
about O
getting O
another O
one O
as O
a O
back O
- O
up O
. O

My O
old O
Con O
- O
Air O
finally O
bit O
the O
dust O
. O
I O
had O
been O
impressed O
with O
my O
hair O
stylist O
's O
hair O
dryer O
, O
but O
I O
knew O
such O
an O
expensive O
unit O
was O
out O
of O
my O
budget O
. O
However O
, O
I O
was O
willing O
to O
spend O
a O
little O
more O
than O
$ O
20 O
on O
a O
drugstore O
hair O
dryer O
that O
, O
hopefully O
, O
would O
last O
a O
bit O
longer O
this O
time O
. O
I O
have O
very O
short O
, O
very O
, O
very O
fine O
hair O
. O
When O
it O
was O
longer O
, O
I O
used O
to O
require O
a O
diffuser O
since O
it O
is O
naturally O
wavy O
; O
however O
, O
with O
my O
current O
pixie O
cut O
, O
I O
knew O
I O
only O
really O
needed O
a O
unit O
that O
came O
with O
a O
concentrator O
nozzle O
. O
Because O
of O
the O
short O
- O
length O
and O
fineness O
of O
my O
hair O
, O
I O
also O
wanted O
a O
unit O
that O
had O
a O
good O
range O
of O
temperatures O
and O
speeds O
. O
A O
lot O
of O
what O
's O
available O
on O
the O
market O
now O
is O
too O
hot O
and O
too O
powerful O
for O
my O
hair O
. O
I O
did O
a O
bit O
of O
research O
for O
hair O
dryers O
that O
matched O
my O
criteria O
and O
finally O
settled O
on O
this O
. O
The O
extremely O
positive O
reviews O
left O
by O
other O
Amazon O
customers O
gave O
me O
confidence O
I O
had O
made O
a O
good O
decision O
. O
Happily O
enough O
, O
turns O
out O
I O
was O
correct O
! O
This O
unit O
feels O
solid O
. O
It O
is O
well O
- O
constructed O
, O
and O
does O
n't O
have O
the O
hot O
spots O
like O
my O
old O
Con O
- O
Air O
did O
that O
caused O
its O
paint O
to O
flake O
off O
everywhere O
. O
It O
is O
a O
touch O
heavier O
than O
my O
old O
dryer O
, O
but O
I O
like O
the O
way O
it O
feels O
in O
my O
hand O
. O
The O
bit O
of O
added O
weight O
does O
not O
make O
the O
unit O
any O
more O
difficult O
to O
use O
. O
It O
is O
also O
powerful O
! O
The O
motor O
on O
this O
dryer O
is O
of O
much O
better O
quality O
than O
any O
I O
've O
used O
previously O
, O
causing O
an O
increase O
of O
air O
throughput O
that O
allows O
the O
unit O
to O
dry O
hair O
very O
quickly O
. O
Paradoxically O
, O
this O
unit O
performs O
much O
better O
than O
any O
1875 O
W O
hair O
dryer O
I O
've O
ever O
used O
, O
and O
yet O
it O
is O
much O
, O
much O
quieter O
, O
and O
range O
of O
airflows O
gives O
it O
finesse O
. O
It O
comes O
with O
3 O
different O
temperature O
settings O
and O
3 O
different O
airflow O
settings O
, O
and O
I O
have O
found O
the O
medium O
temperature O
and O
medium O
airflow O
to O
be O
perfect O
for O
my O
needs O
. O
If O
you O
use O
the O
highest O
temperature O
setting O
, O
it O
will O
get O
hot O
! O
So O
if O
you O
need O
the O
high O
temp O
and O
high O
power O
, O
it O
is O
definitely O
there O
for O
you O
. O
It O
also O
comes O
with O
a O
concentrator O
nozzle O
, O
the O
output O
width O
of O
which O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
is O
the O
perfect O
length O
. O
Some O
nozzles O
tend O
to O
be O
exorbitantly O
wide O
, O
which O
is O
probably O
fine O
if O
you O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
hair O
. O
But O
the O
output O
width O
of O
this O
nozzle O
is O
only O
around O
2 O
, O
perfect O
for O
a O
shortie O
like O
me O
. O
What O
more O
can O
I O
say O
? O
I O
am O
extremely O
happy O
with O
this O
purchase O
. O
It O
does O
arrive O
in O
a O
box O
that O
looks O
like O
it O
came O
straight O
out O
of O
the O
late O
80s O
/ O
early O
90s O
, O
which O
I O
just O
found O
to O
be O
humorous O
. O
It O
is O
very O
no O
- O
muss O
, O
no O
- O
fuss O
, O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
even O
think O
mine O
had O
packaged O
instructions O
with O
it O
. O
But O
it O
works O
just O
as O
well O
as O
my O
stylist O
's O
professional O
dryer O
and O
at O
a O
terrific O
price O
point O
. O
I O
would O
buy O
again O
in O
a O
heartbeat O
( O
but O
hopefully O
I O
wo O
n't O
have O
to O
, O
at O
least O
for O
a O
long O
, O
long O
time O
) O
. O

I O
love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O

I O
have O
long O
hair O
so O
it O
used O
to O
take O
me O
over O
10 O
minutes O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
completely O
. O
Now O
i O
can O
get O
it O
dry O
in O
less O
than O
5 O
minutes O
! O
It O
's O
also O
useful O
to O
know O
that O
when O
you O
have O
it O
on O
the O
low O
/ O
medium O
speed O
, O
it O
's O
uber O
quiet O
. O
I O
can O
blow O
dry O
my O
hair O
at O
night O
without O
having O
to O
worry O
about O
waking O
my O
family O
members O
. O
Definitely O
worth O
the O
money O
. O

Garbage O
. O
Had O
it O
for O
a O
year O
, O
the O
cheap O
plastic O
fan O
is O
cracked O
and O
it O
's O
done O
. O

Much O
quieter O
than O
my O
old O
hairdryer O
. O
Works O
great O
, O
love O
the O
option O
for O
warm O
, O
hot O
or O
cool O
settings O
. O
Wish O
it O
collapsed O
so O
it O
fit O
in O
my O
drawer O
better O
but O
otherwise O
its O
great O
for O
the O
price O
.My O
sister O
is O
a O
hairdresser O
and O
she O
buys O
cheap O
hair O
dryers O
, O
says O
its O
not O
worth O
the O
money O
to O
buy O
expensive O
ones O
. O

Works O
great O

that O
make O
it O
hard O
to O
dry O

and O
the O
( O

  O
This O
dryer O
has O
been O
getting O
very O
hot O
on O
the O
hand O
piece O
. O
It O
makes O
a O
click O
noise O
and O
then O
gets O
hot O
. O
I O
recently O
saw O
sparks O
shoot O
when O
the O
clicking O
occured O
and O
am O
scared O
to O
use O
it O
. O
My O
husband O

I O
looked O
at O
it O
together O

multiple O
times O

the O

I O

I O
want O
a O

a O

a O
small O
one O

! O
I O
have O
been O
using O
it O
for O
probably O
10 O
years O
! O
When O
I O
moved O
out O
after O
college O
, O
I O
bought O
one O
for O
my O
apartment O
since O
my O

wanted O
to O
keep O
hers O

for O
about O
five O
years O

used O
it O
nearly O
daily O

It O
finally O
started O

noise O

I O

it O
with O
the O
exact O

model O

A O
five O
year O
life O
span O
for O
such O
an O
inexpensive O
hair O

my O
expectations O

and O
this O
product O
has O
the O
power O
to O
make O
my O
hair O
nice O
and O
smooth O
without O
much O
effort O
. O
It O
has O
a O
cool O
blast O
switch O
to O
lock O
the O
style O
in O
place O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
use O
as O
much O
hair O
product O
because O
this O
blow O
dryer O
makes O
my O
hair O
straight O
with O
basically O
just O
a O
brush O
. O
If O
you O
have O
frizzy O
hair O
this O
is O
the O
blow O
dryer O
for O
you O

This O
dryer O
was O
perfect O
blow O
speed O
for O
my O
long O
fine O
hair O
. O
  O
High O
blow O
was O
drying O
and O
so O
was O
low O
. O
  O
Low O
allowed O
styling O
unlike O
my O
other O
( O
conair O
1875 O
which O
missed O
class O
on O
what O
does O
High O
versus O
Low O
mean O
) O
.. O
  O
Great O
selections O
for O
any O
speed O
/ O
heat O
you O
want O
. O
  O
On O
this O
one O
, O
  O
I O
give O
kudos O
to O
however O
designed O
the O
switches O
- O
probably O
a O
woman O
. O
  O
This O
is O
light O
- O
weight O
and O
had O
everything O
I O
wanted O
Except O
---&#62 O
; O
it O
did O
not O
appear O
to O
be O
truly O
ionic O
for O
me O
. O
  O
My O
hair O
looked O
terrible O
. O
  O
The O
box O
and O
inside O
pamphlet O
states O
ionic O
, O
but O
the O
dryer O
did O
nothing O
for O
my O
hair O
. O
  O
It O
was O
a O
limp O
flyaway O
mess O
. O
  O
Disappointed O
as O
the O
rest O
of O
it O
was O
great O
. O
  O
This O
may O
work O
for O
you O
and O
I O
would O
recommend O
you O
give O
it O
a O
try O
. O

Mom O
's O
love O
it O

Nice O
and O
compact O
with O
lots O
of O
drying O
power O
. O
Also O
not O
as O
loud O
as O
some O
other O
hair O
driers O
. O

I O
like O
the O
way O
it O
folds O
up O
, O
but O
the O
cord O
rarely O
retracts O
all O
the O
way O
without O
spending O
5 O
minutes O
pulling O
it O
out O
and O
pressing O
the O
retract O
button O
and O
pushing O
it O
back O
into O
the O
handle O
. O
The O
blower O
itself O
works O
fine O
, O
but O
I O
bought O
it O
for O
the O
retractable O
cord O
, O
which O
is O
more O
a O
pain O
than O
a O
gain O
. O

great O

good O

Second O
time O
buying O
this O
item O
because O
I O
wore O
the O
first O
one O
out O
. O
Love O
it O
. O

Quick O
drying O
of O
hair O
without O
making O
it O
brittle O
. O
  O
Gave O
my O
hair O
quite O
a O
bit O
of O
volume O
as O
well O
which O
was O
a O
plus O
! O

I O
did O
not O
like O
the O
design O
or O
the O
size O
so O
I O
sent O
it O
back O
. O
Pretty O
clunky O
- O
looking O
and O
too O
large O
for O
my O
dinky O
bathroom O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
item O
last O
year O
and O
used O
it O
once O
. O
It O
worked O
very O
well O
. O
However O
, O
I O
became O
pregnant O
and O
did O
n't O
have O
time O
to O
focus O
on O
my O
hair O
. O
When O
I O
went O
back O
to O
use O
it O
again O
earlier O
this O
year O
, O
it O
toppled O
over O
and O
the O
legs O
on O
the O
base O
broke O
. O
I O
tried O
gluing O
it O
together O
but O
it O
did O
n't O
work O
. O
I O
am O
disappointed O
because O
I O
was O
hoping O
to O
be O
able O
to O
use O
this O
for O
a O
while O
but O
I O
guess O
not O
. O
The O
top O
is O
definitely O
WAY O
too O
heavy O
for O
the O
base O
it O
comes O
with O
. O
Hoping O
I O
can O
find O
something O
that O
will O
suffice O
or O
buy O
a O
replacement O
base O
. O
Otherwise O
, O
that O
's O
$ O
104 O
down O
the O
drain O
. O
Not O
cool O
... O

The O
ideal O
hair O
dryer O
, O
small O
yet O
powerful O
. O

Great O
dryer O
. O

Works O
great O
cools O
itself O
Down O
would O
buy O
again O

My O
first O
hairdryer O
, O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
much O
to O
compare O
it O
to O
, O
but O
it O
works O
great O
for O
me O
. O

retracting O
cord O
did O
not O
work O
after O
a O
few O
days O
! O

Got O
it O
for O
wife O
to O
replace O
old O
hair O
dryer O
she O
had O
and O
she O
loves O
it O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
sit O
in O
one O
spot O
. O

Great O
air O
pressure O

Great O
dryer O
. O
It O
is O
very O
powerful O
and O
gets O
my O
hair O
dry O
much O
faster O
than O
my O
old O
one O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
product O
. O
It O
's O
bulky O
, O
but O
you O
can O
hang O
it O
. O
It O
works O
, O
but O
for O
all O
of O
the O
advertising O
hoopla O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
that O
different O
. O

like O
it O
, O
very O
durable O
. O
it O
wo O
n't O
dry O
your O
hair O
really O
quickly O
but O
that O
is O
good O
for O
your O
hair O
. O

I O
like O
this O
hair O
dryer O
and O
ca O
n't O
believe O
the O
price O
for O
such O
a O
great O
quality O
dryer O
. O
  O
Highly O
recommend O
. O
  O
Way O
better O
than O
anything O
at O
Walmart O
or O
Target O
. O

Love O
it O

Have O
had O
it O
for O
8 O
months O
, O
works O
great O
. O
Do O
n't O
know O
how O
it O
does O
it O
, O
but O
it O
dries O
my O
hair O
3 O
times O
faster O
and O
with O
less O
heat O
than O
my O
old O
hairdryer O
. O
Not O
disappointed O
. O

very O
good O

It O
can O
tip O
over O
if O
you O
are O
not O
careful O
and O
it O
is O
a O
little O
bit O
suffocating O
- O
feeling O
when O
you O
put O
down O
the O
visor O
. O
It O
is O
definitely O
not O
for O
someone O
afraid O
of O
small O
spaces O
! O

So O
far O
so O
good O
. O
  O
Dries O
my O
hair O
without O
any O
frizz O
, O
is O
lightweight O
and O
not O
noisy O
. O
  O
Comes O
with O
a O
nice O
4 O
year O
warranty O
. O

I O
bought O
Remington O
Ac2015 O
Tstudio O
Salon O
Collection O
Pearl O
Ceramic O
Hair O
Dryer O
almost O
a O
years O
ago O
( O
02 O
August O
2014 O
) O
, O
and O
it O
is O
a O
great O
hair O
dryer O
- O
definitely O
a O
5 O
stars O
. O
Both O
I O
and O
my O
husband O
( O
and O
occasionally O
our O
dog O
) O
have O
been O
using O
this O
hair O
dryer O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
- O
we O
're O
among O
those O
people O
who O
always O
dry O
their O
hair O
- O
and O
it O
still O
works O
perfectly O
. O
I O
am O
quite O
picky O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
hair O
dryer O
: O
I O
like O
them O
to O
be O
powerful O
enough O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
quickly O
, O
but O
I O
also O
want O
them O
to O
be O
gentle O
not O
to O
kill O
my O
hair O
. O
The O
Remington O
AC2015 O
does O
its O
job O
nice O
and O
quickly O
. O
I O
have O
long O
( O
almost O
waist O
length O
) O
, O
thick O
, O
and O
very O
straight O
hair O
. O
I O
wash O
them O
every O
2 O
- O
3 O
days O
using O
natural O
products O
( O
Lush O
shampoo O
and O
conditioner O
) O
, O
and O
also O
oil O
them O
a O
couple O
times O
a O
week O
( O
Jojoba O
oil O
+ O
either O
rosemary O
or O
lavender O
essential O
oil O
) O
. O
I O
use O
a O
wooden O
brush O
- O
but O
only O
when O
they O
're O
dry O
. O
So O
yes O
, O
I O
really O
love O
and O
care O
for O
my O
hair O
! O
But O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
drying O
them O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
imagine O
to O
spend O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
doing O
it O
. O
My O
drying O
routine O
is O
simple O
: O
1 O
) O
I O
remove O
most O
of O
the O
water O
with O
a O
towel O
( O
gently O
) O
and O
use O
my O
fingers O
to O
remove O
tangles O
; O
2 O
) O
then O
I O
blow O
- O
dry O
my O
hair O
upside O
down O
; O
3 O
) O
finally O
, O
I O
brush O
them O
. O
The O
whole O
procedure O
takes O
me O
approx O
. O
15 O
minutes O
, O
using O
the O
maximal O
power O
( O
level O
3 O
) O
and O
heat O
( O
again O
3 O
) O
of O
the O
hair O
dryer O
. O
My O
husband O
has O
way O
shorted O
and O
fewer O
hair O
than O
I O
do O
, O
straight O
and O
thin O
. O
He O
uses O
my O
same O
shampoo O
and O
conditioner O
, O
but O
wo O
n't O
do O
anything O
more O
than O
that O
. O
He O
would O
n't O
need O
to O
use O
a O
hair O
dryer O
, O
but O
love O
the O
feeling O
. O
It O
takes O
him O
less O
than O
a O
minute O
to O
be O
perfectly O
dry O
. O
My O
dog O
is O
a O
Scottish O
Terrier O
- O
so O
she O
's O
small O
but O
has O
longish O
and O
super O
thick O
fur O
. O
We O
wash O
her O
in O
the O
bathtub O
with O
natural O
Castille O
soap O
. O
To O
dry O
her O
fur O
, O
we O
first O
wrap O
her O
in O
a O
towel O
, O
and O
remove O
most O
of O
the O
water O
, O
then O
we O
use O
the O
hair O
dryer O
alternating O
medium O
heat O
( O
level O
2 O
) O
and O
cold O
air O
to O
avoid O
burning O
her O
skin O
. O
When O
she O
starts O
being O
somewhat O
dryer O
, O
we O
use O
her O
brush O
to O
attack O
the O
most O
hidden O
hair O
( O
e.g. O
armpits O
) O
. O
It O
takes O
us O
approx O
. O
1 O
hour O
. O
To O
sum O
up O
, O
this O
hair O
dryer O
is O
durable O
and O
high O
quality O
- O
a O
great O
bang O
for O
the O
buck O
! O

Broken O

Its O
small O
, O
light O
and O
folds O
inside O
which O
is O
good O
for O
travelling O
purpose O
. O
My O
mom O
loved O
the O
size O
and O
color O
. O
The O
noise O
from O
the O
dryer O
is O
not O
loud O
. O

Powerful O
little O
dryer O
, O
and O
I O
love O
the O
small O
size O
, O
it O
fits O
well O
in O
my O
tiny O
bathroom O
. O

Lasted O
about O
a O
year O
. O
  O
I O
'm O
back O
to O
Remington O
, O
I O
used O
Remington O
hair O
dryers O
for O
years O
and O
they O
last O
the O
longest O
. O
  O
Just O
bought O
a O
new O
$ O
20.00 O
one O
at O
Walmart O
and O
even O
it O
has O
a O
  O
2 O
year O
guarantee O
on O
it O
. O

Love O
it O
! O
! O
Drys O
hair O
fast O
! O
! O
No O
frizz O
! O
! O

It O
is O
too O
loud O
. O
  O
I O
googled O
quiet O
hair O
dryers O
and O
it O
came O
up O
. O

I O
actually O
love O
how O
this O
dryer O
performs O
but O
it O
looses O
its O
motor O
and O
heat O
too O
quickly O
, O
had O
to O
send O
back O
to O
the O
manufacturer O
within O
4 O
months O
already O
once O
and O
doing O
the O
same O
thing O
again O

I O
like O
it O
. O
  O
It O
dries O
my O
hair O
pretty O
quickly O
and O
I O
have O
long O
hair O
. O

There O
's O
a O
learning O
curve O
with O
this O
dryer O
. O
What O
I O
've O
learned:1 O
. O
Do O
n't O
dry O
your O
hair O
all O
the O
way O
( O
if O
it O
's O
curly O
) O
The O
frizz O
will O
erase O
all O
the O
work O
you O
just O
did.2 O
. O
Place O
your O
hair O
cradled O
in O
the O
dryers O
teeth O
and O
THEN O
turn O
it O
on O
. O
Hold O
for O
as O
long O
as O
you O
need O
, O
then O
turn O
the O
dryer O
off O
before O
moving O
to O
a O
new O
section O
. O
Any O
time O
this O
dryer O
is O
not O
full O
of O
hair O
and O
right O
up O
next O
to O
your O
scalp O
, O
it O
's O
making O
a O
frizz O
mess.3 O
. O
After O
drying O
75 O
% O
of O
the O
way O
, O
stop O
and O
clip O
up O
your O
roots O
to O
avoid O
flat O
head O
. O
I O
find O
that O
the O
hair O
next O
to O
my O
scalp O
is O
still O
a O
little O
damp O
and O
susceptible O
to O
flatness O
. O
It O
's O
a O
fine O
dryer O
, O
and O
I O
use O
it O
occasionally O
when O
I O
'm O
in O
a O
hurry O
, O
but O
for O
curly O
hair O
( O
I O
'm O
a O
2c/3a O
with O
fine O
hair O
) O
I O
find O
it O
's O
always O
best O
to O
air O
dry O
. O

Great O
product O
! O

First O
used O
this O
hairdryer O
model O
in O
a O
hotel O
room O
last O
fall O
and O
loved O
it O
. O
My O
own O
hairdryer O
finally O
gave O
out O
so O
I O
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
buy O
this O
, O
very O
happy O
with O
it O
. O
Retraction O
of O
the O
cord O
works O
very O
well O
compared O
to O
my O
previous O
one O
, O
and O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
have O
less O
frizz O
after O
drying O
my O
hair O
with O
this O
one O
, O
probably O
because O
it O
has O
the O
diffuser O
at O
the O
end O
. O
Even O
on O
the O
highest O
setting O
it O
's O
not O
too O
hot O
. O

Love O
it O

I O
was O
skeptical O
because O
it O
was O
so O
small O
but O
this O
baby O
packs O
a O
punch O
. O
  O
My O
hair O
is O
past O
the O
halfway O
point O
of O
my O
back O
. O
I O
have O
long O
thick O
hair O
and O
it O
is O
ombred O
( O
bleached O
) O
. O
Sometimes O
chemically O
treated O
hair O
takes O
forever O
to O
dry O
but O
this O
thing O
does O
the O
job O
as O
if O
it O
's O
a O
regular O
sized O
hair O
dryer O
. O
Definitely O
a O
plus O
. O
If O
it O
breaks O
, O
you O
'll O
bet O
I O
'll O
just O
buy O
another O
without O
complaint O
. O

It O
works O
as O
expected O
, O
the O
button O
to O
retract O
the O
cord O
is O
little O
stiff O
otherwise O
it O
is O
prefect O
. O

Excellent O
travel O
dryer O
for O
our O
European O
trip O
. O
  O
The O
only O
downside O
is O
that O
when O
used O
with O
higher O
voltage O
you O
can O
only O
use O
one O
setting O
. O
  O
The O
low O
setting O
is O
high O
at O
220V O
, O
but O
it O
worked O
well O
for O
our O
purposes O
. O
  O
I O
recommend O
this O
highly O
. O

Great O
product O
and O
super O
fast O
delivery O
. O

I O
love O
the O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
It O
's O
small O
enough O
, O
not O
heavy O
or O
cumbersome O
so O
that O
it O
wo O
nt O
aggravate O
my O
carpal O
tunnel O
syndrome O
. O

Basic O
hair O
dryers O
for O
a O
WM O
price O
. O
  O
Why O
stand O
in O
line O
when O
you O
can O
get O
on O
Amazon O
for O
the O
same O
price O
? O
  O
I O
bought O
one O
for O
each O
bathroom O
in O
a O
rental O
property O
. O

Very O
cool O

REALLY O
GREAT O
GETS O
VERY O
HOT O

This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
one O
that O
I O
have O
ever O
owned O
! O
The O
price O
was O
definitely O
right O
! O
I O
love O
how O
quiet O
it O
is O
compared O
to O
other O
hair O
dryers O
that O
I O
have O
owned O
! O
It O
has O
three O
heat O
settings O
and O
three O
speed O
settings O
along O
with O
the O
cool O
button O
that O
you O
can O
press O
to O
get O
a O
blast O
of O
cool O
air O
. O
It O
dries O
my O
hair O
a O
lot O
faster O
than O
other O
hair O
dryers O
and O
it O
leaves O
my O
hair O
feeling O
softer O
than O
when O
I O
dry O
it O
with O
other O
hair O
dryers O
. O
I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
this O
to O
others O
! O

bought O
this O
to O
replace O
the O
exact O
same O
model O
for O
my O
wife O
that O
was O
10 O
years O
old O
... O
it O
's O
a O
good O
product O
... O
works O
really O
good O
and O
easy O
to O
store O
... O

It O
was O
nice O
while O
the O
retractable O
cord O
worked O
, O
but O
that O
stopped O
working O
after O
2 O
months O
. O
Now O
I O
have O
to O
stand O
right O
next O
to O
the O
outlet O
because O
the O
cord O
wo O
n't O
pull O
out O
. O

Purchased O
this O
product O
at O
the O
end O
of O
March O
as O
a O
result O
of O
positive O
reviews O
. O
It O
periodically O
shut O
off O
until O
finally O
this O
week O
it O
stopped O
working O
completely O
. O
After O
only O
4 O
months O
, O
a O
hair O
dryer O
should O
not O
stop O
working O
. O
Definitely O
would O
not O
recommend O
. O

Just O
wht O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
. O
Great O
product O
. O

i O
love O
it O

This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
not O
adjustable O
and O
does O
not O
have O
enough O
heating O
power O

Does O
not O
  O
last O
. O
  O
Flew O
apart O
in O
pieces O
one O
afternoon O
while O
using O
it O
. O
  O
I O
am O
a O
guy O
and O
only O
use O
it O
a O
few O
minutes O
a O
day O
. O
  O
Plus O
, O
the O
new O
version O
is O
built O
much O
cheaper O
. O
  O
Not O
worth O
$ O
49 O
. O
  O
Never O
had O
a O
fan O
blade O
split O
apart O
like O
this O
dryer O
. O

One O
of O
the O
best O
! O

My O
girlfriend O
has O
had O
this O
for O
3 O
days O
, O
so O
obviously O
comments O
on O
longevity O
ca O
n't O
be O
included O
. O
It O
works O
well O
, O
light O
, O
cute O
colors O
, O
ca O
n't O
complain O
. O

I O
love O
this O
! O
Not O
only O
does O
it O
take O
way O
less O
time O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
this O
way O
when O
I O
'm O
in O
a O
hurry O
, O
but O
it O
makes O
my O
hair O
voluminous O
and O
wavy O
instead O
of O
flat O
and O
oily O
and O
curly O
in O
all O
the O
wrong O
places O
! O
There O
's O
a O
bit O
of O
frizz O
but O
it O
's O
not O
bad O
compared O
to O
what O
I O
've O
experienced O
at O
the O
hands O
of O
a O
regular O
hair O
dryer O
. O
Amazing O
product O
for O
a O
curly O
haired O
girl O
! O

This O
is O
my O
second O
one O
as O
the O
first O
one O
got O
a O
short O
in O
it O
. O
  O
I O
love O
not O
having O
the O
hairdryer O
laying O
out O
in O
the O
way O
. O
  O
It O
helps O
keep O
my O
bathroom O
organized O

does O
n't O
even O
work O
i O
do O
nt O
know O
why O
i O
've O
kept O
mine O
for O
so O
long O
... O
oh O
well O

All O
ok O

This O
hair O
dryer O
blows O
so O
much O
smoke O
, O
it O
has O
to O
be O
unhealthy O
for O
my O
hair O
. O
When O
I O
made O
this O
purchase O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
high O
wattage O
, O
ceramic O
ionic O
hair O
dryer O
. O
After O
the O
first O
use O
, O
I O
have O
realized O
that O
it O
probably O
has O
a O
high O
wattage O
but O
the O
other O
selling O
points O
may O
not O
be O
true O
. O
I O
have O
always O
purchased O
professional O
hair O
dryers O
and O
never O
did O
they O
blow O
out O
smoke O
like O
this O
one O
. O
I O
do O
not O
recommend O
this O
product O
and O
wish O
I O
did O
n't O
waste O
my O
money O
in O
such O
a O
poor O
quality O
tool O
. O

This O
product O
was O
a O
terrible O
disappointment O
. O
The O
retractable O
cord O
stopped O
retracting O
almost O
the O
first O
time O
I O
used O
it O
. O

NOT O
ENOUGH O
BLOW O

I O
've O
had O
this O
blow O
dryer O
for O
probably O
a O
little O
longer O
than O
a O
year O
and O
I O
absolutely O
love O
it O
. O
It O
's O
blow O
power O
is O
incredibly O
strong O
compared O
to O
most O
dryers O
( O
think O
hurricane O
vs O
gentle O
breeze O
) O
. O
Of O
course O
, O
you O
can O
use O
the O
low O
setting O
which O
is O
powerful O
too O
but O
if O
you O
want O
to O
dry O
your O
hair O
fast O
, O
this O
dryer O
will O
not O
disappoint O
. O
It O
also O
heats O
up O
quickly O
, O
cools O
down O
quickly O
, O
comes O
with O
several O
attachments O
, O
and O
has O
a O
long O
cord O
. O
The O
only O
downside O
is O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
where O
the O
buttons O
are O
because O
the O
way O
I O
hold O
it O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
, O
many O
times O
, O
I O
accidentally O
turn O
the O
heat O
onto O
cool O
without O
meaning O
to O
. O
I O
would O
buy O
this O
a O
thousand O
times O
over O
. O

The O
hair O
dryer O
actually O
worked O
great O
for O
a O
few O
months O
but O
after O
using O
the O
cool O
button O
the O
other O
day O
it O
will O
not O
blow O
any O
warm O
air O
. O

Dryer O
itself O
works O
ok O
. O
Packaging O
is O
horrible O
. O
It O
came O
in O
a O
broken O
box O
and O
a O
tangled O
unraveled O
cord O
. O
Not O
suitable O
for O
a O
gift O
. O
Ok O
if O
it O
's O
for O
your O
own O
personal O
use O
. O

Do O
n't O
waste O
your O
money O
. O
  O
I O
mounted O
it O
and O
it O
's O
terrible O
- O
loud O
and O
does O
n't O
dry O
hair O
very O
well O
at O
all O
.. O
now O
I O
have O
to O
unmount O
again O
. O

Great O
dryer O
. O
We O
like O
it O
very O
much O
. O

I O
waited O
until O
I O
used O
the O
hair O
dryer O
for O
a O
couple O
months O
before O
writing O
a O
review O
. O
  O
I O
have O
medium O
length O
hair O
and O
dry O
my O
hair O
about O
4 O
days O
a O
week O
. O
  O
So O
far O
this O
hair O
drying O
has O
held O
up O
very O
well O
. O
  O
It O
's O
light O
weight O
and O
is O
actually O
a O
little O
quieter O
than O
my O
previous O
Revlon O
hair O
dryer O
that O
died O
after O
10 O
years O
of O
use O
. O
  O
I O
do O
n't O
use O
the O
diffuser O
because O
it O
does O
n't O
do O
a O
thing O
for O
my O
board O
straight O
hair O
. O
  O
For O
the O
money O
this O
is O
an O
excellent O
dryer O
. O

This O
dryer O
does O
its O
job O
well O
and O
is O
convenient O
to O
use O
. O
  O
They O
really O
should O
consider O
changing O
the O
elastic O
in O
the O
bonnet O
to O
a O
string O
that O
is O
more O
adjustable O
. O
The O
elastic O
was O
so O
tight O
that O
I O
cut O
it O
out O
and O
restrung O
it O
with O
a O
shoelace O
. O
There O
would O
have O
been O
no O
way O
I O
could O
have O
fit O
rollers O
in O
it O
without O
doing O
that O
. O

the O
first O
time O
I O
used O
it O
, O
I O
cut O
it O
on O
high O
and O
the O
motor O
popped O
. O

  O

I O
really O
like O
this O
dryer O
. O
  O
Not O
sure O
why O
complaints O
about O
the O
cord O
- O
directions O
say O
to O
hold O
the O
plug O
. O
  O
If O
you O
do O
n't O
hold O
the O
plug O
of O
course O
it O
's O
gon O
na O
snap O
back O
and O
hit O
you O
. O
  O
As O
for O
the O
noise O
. O
  O
Yes O
, O
it O
is O
noisy O
but O
you O
are O
using O
it O
for O
a O
short O
time O
and O
it O
is O
just O
as O
noisy O
as O
any O
other O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
And O
it O
is O
not O
too O
heavy O
. O
  O
I O
think O
it O
dries O
my O
hair O
fast O
and O
arm O
does O
not O
get O
tired O
. O
  O
All O
in O
all O
, O
I O
would O
recommend O
this O
dryer O
. O
  O
I O
love O
that O
it O
is O
pink O
, O
the O
cord O
retracts O
and O
takes O
up O
little O
space O
for O
storage O
. O

Dries O
hair O
quickly O
without O
getting O
too O
hot O
. O

Works O
fine--- O
could O
n't O
be O
better O

I O
bought O
this O
item O
and O
it O
shipped O
on O
June O
9 O
. O
I O
bought O
a O
place O
and O
finally O
got O
to O
putting O
it O
up O
July O
12 O
. O
  O
It O
did O
n't O
work O
; O
it O
did O
n't O
even O
turn O
on O
. O
I O
went O
online O
to O
Amazon O
to O
exchange O
it O
for O
one O
that O
worked O
, O
but O
they O
said O
my O
last O
date O
to O
return O
it O
was O
July O
11 O
. O
So O
I O
say O
do O
n't O
bother O
buying O
this O
piece O
of O
crap O
; O
and O
be O
careful O
about O
buying O
things O
thru O
Amazon O
. O

Drys O
my O
thick O
hair O
fast O
! O
! O

I O
expected O
it O
to O
be O
smaller O
. O

My O
wife O
loves O
it O
! O
! O
! O

Our O
clients O
love O
it O
. O
It O
has O
a O
quality O
look O
to O
it O
. O

Great O
hair O
dryer O
, O
just O
the O
right O
speed O
and O
temperature O
to O
do O
your O
hair O
. O
Best O
hair O
dryer O
I O
have O
owned O
, O
beats O
out O
the O
dryers O
I O
have O
paid O
almost O
$ O
200 O
for O
. O

Just O
got O
this O
blow O
dryer O
. O
  O
It O
does O
n't O
blow O
as O
hot O
as O
I O
expected O
it O
to O
heat O
up O
. O
  O
Just O
used O
it O
to O
style O
my O
hair O
. O
  O
But O
is O
definitely O
better O
than O
the O
ones O
you O
'd O
find O
a O
Walmart O
, O
etc O
... O
My O
hair O
is O
relaxed O
and O
tends O
to O
absorb O
a O
lot O
of O
water O
. O
  O
I O
Will O
post O
an O
update O
later O
with O
additional O
feedback O
... O

Dries O
fast O
and O
a O
bit O
quieter O
then O
my O
old O
dryer O
. O
  O
Because O
of O
the O
wider O
nozzle O
its O
seems O
like O
less O
air O
, O
but O
the O
dry O
time O
for O
my O
hair O
is O
the O
same O
. O
  O
Perfectly O
happy O
with O
my O
new O
dryer O
. O

Great O

Love O
it O

I O
bought O
this O
for O
a O
friend O
as O
a O
gift O
she O
  O
loves O
it O
she O
has O
her O
own O
shop O
. O

The O
best O

DO O
NOT O
BUY O
! O
As O
other O
reviewers O
have O
stated O
the O
area O
of O
cord O
where O
it O
comes O
out O
of O
the O
handle O
wears O
out O
and O
short O
circuits O
causing O
pops O
, O
sparks O
and O
fire O
! O
This O
happened O
after O
1 O
year O
of O
use O
almost O
to O
the O
day O
. O
I O
live O
alone O
and O
use O
it O
once O
/ O
day O
mostly O
on O
high O
heat O
. O
The O
problem O
is O
obviously O
a O
cheap O
cord O
that O
when O
bent O
back O
and O
forth O
enough O
times O
will O
wear O
the O
wire O
enough O
to O
short O
out O
. O
This O
is O
not O
a O
fluke O
but O
  O
bad O
design O
components O
. O
When O
I O
compare O
the O
cord O
to O
other O
dryers O
I O
clearly O
see O
the O
difference O
in O
cord O
. O
This O
cord O
has O
more O
of O
a O
softer O
  O
rubber O
feel O
and O
a O
dull O
dark O
color O
, O
where O
proper O
cords O
have O
a O
shiny O
finish O
and O
more O
of O
a O
hard O
vinyl O
feel O
. O
Believe O
me O
this O
will O
happen O
to O
all O
of O
these O
units O
eventually O
if O
you O
use O
the O
high O
heat O
settings O
daily O
. O
I O
would O
definitely O
not O
buy O
this O
again.and O
I O
would O
look O
for O
another O
brand O
. O

Does O
the O
job O
for O
a O
great O
price O
:) O

I O
love O
my O
new O
blow O
dryer O
. O
It O
does O
not O
dry O
out O
my O
hair O
. O
perfect O
. O
Thanks O

Works O
great O
. O
Good O
price O
. O
Just O
as O
described O

So O
far O
works O
great O
! O

I O
appreciated O
the O
low O
noise O
level O
and O
range O
of O
heat O
/ O
speed O
settings O
. O
  O
Unfortunately O
, O
the O
product O
lasted O
less O
than O
a O
month O
with O
daily O
use O
by O
one O
person O
. O

Love O
this O
dryer O
. O
Great O
feature O
at O
a O
great O
price O

Good O
item O
! O

Excellent O
product O
. O
Small O
but O
very O
powerful O
. O

great O
buy O

Great O

The O
hi O
setting O
does O
get O
very O
hot O
. O
The O
lo O
setting O
works O
just O
fine O
and O
I O
have O
thick O
, O
curly O
hair O
. O
It O
usually O
takes O
my O
hair O
a O
long O
time O
to O
dry O
but O
I O
can O
sit O
under O
this O
dryer O
20 O
minutes O
. O
I O
hate O
sitting O
under O
the O
dryer O
! O
I O
have O
gone O
to O
the O
salon O
and O
have O
to O
sit O
an O
hour O
or O
more O
under O
theirs O
! O
Adjusting O
the O
height O
might O
be O
an O
issue O
for O
some O
. O
If O
you O
have O
a O
chair O
that O
can O
raise O
up O
and O
down O
, O
that O
will O
be O
perfect O
. O
Overall O
, O
I O
like O
this O
dryer O
. O
I O
use O
it O
about O
twice O
a O
month O
for O
deep O
conditioning O
treatments O
or O
to O
set O
twist O
styles O
. O
I O
'm O
glad O
I O
made O
this O
purchase O
. O

The O
hair O
dryer O
is O
smaller O
than O
my O
regular O
dryer O
but O
bigger O
than O
I O
would O
have O
liked O
. O
It O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
and O
I O
like O
that O
it O
folds O
in O
half O
. O

This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
very O
powerful O
and O
dries O
quickly O
. O

Well O
worth O
the O
money O
! O
I O
'm O
growing O
super O
long O
hair O
and O
this O
makes O
my O
hair O
so O
soft O
and O
shiny O
! O
I O
should O
have O
discovered O
this O
earlier O
! O

Reliable O
, O
reasonably O
loud O
, O
and O
lasts O
long O
. O
I O
used O
Conair O
before O
and O
those O
malfunction O
super O
easily O
. O

I O
love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
Using O
the O
attached O
comb O
makes O
it O
very O
easy O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
. O
Two O
thumbs O
up O
. O

Nice O
hair O
dryer O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
flip O
my O
head O
upside O
down O
to O
use O
it O
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
1 O
star O
review O
I O
have O
ever O
written O
. O
This O
blow O
dryer O
worked O
fine O
for O
18 O
months O
. O
However O
I O
heard O
a O
shriek O
upstairs O
when O
my O
wife O
was O
drying O
her O
hair O
. O
She O
said O
it O
was O
on O
fire O
and O
she O
had O
unplugged O
it O
. O
I O
could O
smell O
the O
burning O
smell O
. O
Later O
that O
day O
I O
started O
wondering O
why O
it O
had O
n't O
blown O
a O
breaker O
and O
decided O
that O
possible O
lint O
had O
accumulated O
and O
touched O
the O
burner O
wire O
. O
I O
did O
clean O
out O
some O
lint O
and O
turned O
on O
the O
dryer O
to O
see O
if O
I O
had O
solved O
problem O
. O
No O
! O
  O
After O
about O
10 O
seconds O
smoke O
came O
out O
, O
there O
was O
a O
burning O
smell O
, O
and O
the O
handle O
got O
hot O
. O
Obviously O
this O
is O
the O
last O
of O
this O
product O
for O
us O
. O
The O
warranty O
is O
out O
by O
6 O
months O
and O
if O
it O
had O
just O
quit O
working O
that O
is O
one O
thing O
. O
But O
this O
is O
a O
safety O
issue O
and O
the O
product O
should O
be O
recalled O
. O

The O
only O
problem O
with O
this O
dryer O
is O
that O
the O
long O
metal O
pole O
connecting O
to O
the O
hood O
. O
The O
round O
piece O
around O
the O
metal O
pole O
is O
cracked O
! O
! O
! O
  O
Trying O
to O
figure O
out O
how O
I O
can O
find O
a O
better O
solution O
then O
this O
plastic O
piece O
around O
the O
metal O
pole O
. O

Nothing O
too O
special O
here O
. O
  O
Okay O
hair O
dryer O
. O

My O
old O
hair O
dryer O
quit O
on O
me O
. O
  O
So O
this O
one O
has O
been O
used O
since O
the O
day O
it O
arrived O
. O
  O
I O
love O
it O
, O
and O
it O
does O
a O
great O
job O
of O
blowing O
my O
hair O
dry O
. O

This O
Conair O
hair O
dryer O
works O
great O
. O
It O
runs O
smooth O
and O
quieter O
than O
my O
last O
hair O
dryer O
( O
an O
old O
Remington O
) O
. O
The O
cord O
retracts O
nicely O
into O
the O
handle O
when O
finished O
. O
I O
recommend O
this O
item O
. O

Truly O
a O
great O
dryer O
! O
I O
ordered O
one O
for O
my O
mother O
, O
who O
then O
ordered O
one O
for O

, O
so O
naturally O
I O
had O
to O
have O
one O
of O
my O
own O
! O
Significantly O
reduces O
flat O
iron O
time O
. O
I O
took O
a O
star O
because O
the O
brush O
attachment O
does O
not O
stay O
on O
properly O
. O
It O
comes O
off O
the O
dryer O
once O
or O
twice O
while O
I O
'm O
using O
it O
. O
I O
have O
a O
had O
an O
issue O
in O
the O
past O
with O
most O

at O
all O
. O

Quality O
hair O
dryer O

working O
years O
later O

  O
Because O
of O
the O
rounded O
edges O
, O
it O
does O
not O
sit O
on O
a O
flat O
surface O
well O
and O
mine O
has O
fallen O
and O
gotten O
chipped O
over O
the O
years O
but O
it O
still O
works O
. O

Exactly O
what O
was O
described O
is O
exactly O
what O
I O
needed O

Working O

hair O
, O
usually O
take O
me O
over O

hour O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
but O
with O
this O
hairdryer O
it O
only O
take O
me O
30 O
minutes O

This O
is O
a O
great O
blowdryer O

Has O
full O
power O
in O
a O
compact O

Handle O
folds O

Used O
it O
in O
France O
wth O
an O

. O

My O
hairdryer O
fried O
out O
when O
I O
was O
on O
vacation O
after O
a O
few O
months O
. O
  O
I O
replaced O
it O
with O
a O
30 O
$ O
revlon O
hairdryer O
that O
has O
lasted O
four O
years O
. O
I O
would O
n't O
waste O
my O
money O
on O
this O
! O

Great O
for O
travel O
with O
lots O
of O
power O
and O
heat O
. O

My O
first O
one O
lasted O
20 O
years O
. O
I O
ordered O
this O
to O
replace O
it O
. O

Works O
great O
, O
easy O
to O
use O
. O
Lightweight O
and O
not O
too O
noisy O
compared O
to O
others O
. O
The O
included O
attachments O
are O
great O
. O

Good O
  O
but O
loud O

I O
love O
this O
blowdryer O
! O
! O
It O
has O
a O
very O
powerful O
flow O
of O
air O
which O
is O
excellent O
for O
straight O
hair O
like O
mine O
. O
Comes O
with O
all O
standard O
attachments O
and O
I O
think O
would O
be O
great O
for O
any O
type O
of O
hair O
. O
Excellent O
quality O
for O
the O
price O
. O
I O
have O
had O
mine O
for O
over O
a O
year O
now O
and O
it O
still O
works O
like O
it O
is O
brand O
new O

Love O
it O
. O
  O
I O
ordered O

Works O
great O
, O
small O
, O
lightweight O
, O
easy O
to O
handle O
. O
  O
Like O
the O
long O
cord O
and O
the O
cool O
shot O
button O
. O

Works O
great O
and O
does O
dry O
very O
quickly O
. O
  O
My O
only O
complaint O
, O
and O
it O
bugs O
me O
daily O
, O
is O
that O
the O
switches O
are O
right O
where O
you O
have O
your O
fingers O
and O
they O
're O
easy O
to O
flip O
so O
I O
am O
constantly O
turning O
it O
off O
/ O
on O
while O
drying O
. O
  O
That O
's O
annoying O
. O

Product O
excelent O
. O
Arrive O

I O
use O
2 O
products O

  O
Folds O
nicely O
, O
cord O
retracts O
well O
. O

Love O
it O
but O
the O
watts O
are O
so O
high O
that O
it O
keeps O
blowing O
fuses O
all O
the O
time O
! O
! O
! O

This O
dryer O
is O
what O
I O
wanted O
at O
a O
reasonable O
price O
. O
It O
was O
easy O
to O
put O
on O
the O
wall O
. O

Like O
it O
  O
it O
is O
pretty O

it O
in O
my O
RV O
too O
. O

I O
absolutely O
love O
my O
blow O
dryer O
. O
It O
's O
not O
crazy O
hot O
to O
the O
point O
of O
burning O
my O
head O
but O
it O
still O
dries O
my O
locks O
; O
  O
all O
3.5 O
feet O
of O
it O
. O

I O
love O

  O
I O
like O
that O

fast O
and O
it O
is O
super O
- O
light O
to O

  O
The O
curved O

makes O
it O
easy O
to O
hold O
. O
  O
Great O

: O
  O
After O
only O
six O
months O
, O
this O
dryer O
is O
wearing O
out O
. O
  O
It O
gets O
way O
too O
intensely O
hot O
, O
even O
on O
the O
medium O
setting O
, O
probably O
because O
the O
fan O
is O
barely O
blowing O
. O
  O
Hardly O
any O
difference O
at O
all O
between O
low O
and O
high O
fan O
, O
and O
it O
barely O
makes O
a O
breeze O

so O
my O
hair O
is O
getting O
all O
heat O

no O

I O
went O
out O

thick O

professional O
grade O

It O
drugs O
my O
hair O
very O
quickly O

it O

  O
Quite O
heavy O
if O
that O
is O
an O
issue O
. O
  O
I O
love O
it O
. O

Great O
hairdryer O
, O
does O
what O
it O
needs O
to O
. O

Love O
it O
, O
very O
convenient O
. O
I O
was O
thrilled O
when O
I O
got O
a O
hotel O
room O
and O
they O
had O
this O
hair O
dryer O
in O
the O
bathroom O
. O
I O
was O
very O
excited O
when O
I O
saw O
it O
available O
on O
Amazon O
. O
I O
really O
did O
n't O
think O
it O
would O
work O
as O
well O
as O
the O
ones O
in O
the O
hotel O
as O
I O
figured O
there O
's O
was O
a O
commercial O
grade O
. O
I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
it O
worked O
just O
as O
well O
. O
I O
get O
a O
lot O
of O
compliments O
on O
it O
when O
I O
have O
guests O
, O
especially O
those O
that O
forgot O
to O
pack O
one O
or O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
go O
digging O
for O
their O
. O
It O
is O
an O
excellent O
idea O
for O
bathrooms O
or O
teenagers O
room O
. O
My O
Granddaughter O
has O
asked O
for O
one O
to O
put O
beside O
her O
vanity O
. O
Perhaps O
Santa O
will O
provide O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
for O
drying O
my O
Miniature O
Schnauzer O
furnishings O
at O
home O
and O
at O
shows O
. O
I O
picked O
this O
one O
because O
it O
has O
air O
coming O
in O
from O
both O
sides O
for O
maximum O
air O
flow O
. O
It O
works O
great O
. O
I O
've O
had O
it O
for O
nearly O
2 O
years O
and O
use O
it O
often O
as O
I O
also O
groom O
for O
a O
few O
other O
owners O
. O
It O
still O
looks O
like O
new O
and O
all O
the O
switches O
work O
just O
like O
day O
one O
. O
I O
will O
buy O
again O
if O
this O
one O
ever O
goes O
out O
. O
I O
will O
also O
buy O
another O
one O
if O
my O
personal O
hair O
dryer O
( O
different O
brand O
) O
ever O
goes O
out O
. O
I O
've O
had O
it O
for O
nearly O
20 O
years O
. O
LOL O

So O
heavy O
I O
felt O
like O
I O
was O
lifting O
weights O
. O
This O
went O
back O
the O
same O
day O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
hair O
dryer O
after O
looking O
without O
success O
for O
one O
this O
small O
in O
local O
stores O
. O
  O
I O
have O
only O
been O
using O
it O
for O
about O
two O
weeks O
, O
and O
it O
is O
meeting O
all O
of O
my O
expectations O
thus O
far O
. O
  O
The O
size O
and O
weight O
are O
perfect O
for O
carrying O
in O
my O
swim O
bag O
, O
taking O
up O
much O
less O
room O
that O
my O
defunct O
dryer O
. O
  O
A O
bonus O
for O
me O
was O
the O
low O
noise O
level O
of O
this O
appliance O
. O
  O
I O
anticipated O
a O
loud O
, O
high O
pitched O
scream O
, O
due O
to O
the O
compact O
size O
, O
but O
it O
operates O
with O
quiet O
efficiency O
. O
  O
I O
have O
short O
hair O
, O
and O
this O
dryer O
delivers O
quick O
drying O
at O
a O
comfortable O
sound O
level O
with O
no O
hassle O
with O
easy O
packability O
. O

Not O
thrilled O
about O
this O
one O
. O
It O
's O
cheap O
and O
it O
shows O
. O
Heavy O
to O
hold O
and O
dries O
the O
hair O
on O
the O
slower O
side O
. O
It O
does O
n't O
have O
that O
hurricane O
effect O
as O
some O
other O
cheaper O
model O
. O
I O
would O
n't O
recommend O
it O
. O

Great O
but O
a O
little O
on O
the O
loud O
side O

Bit O
on O
the O
noisy O
side O
. O
Has O
more O
of O
the O
high O
pitch O
tone O
that O
makes O
it O
annoying O
. O
Otherwise O
, O
nice O
and O
light O
weight O
. O

The O
unit O
was O
cracked O
in O
serveral O
places O
when O
I O
received O
it O
, O
but O
all O
- O
in O
- O
all O
it O
worked O
fairly O
well O
. O

Such O
a O
great O
travel O
hairdryer O
. O
Also O
works O
internationally O
and O
is O
a O
great O
size O
. O

Good O
product O
. O

I O
guess O
I O
've O
always O
been O
using O
sub O
- O
par O
hair O
dryers O
, O
this O
one O
blows O
them O
out O
of O
the O
water O
( O
pun O
very O
much O
intended)Thank O
you O
to O
everyone O
else O
who O
posted O
a O
great O
review O
, O
this O
is O
a O
great O
one O
to O
buy O
and O
I O
'm O
glad O
I O
came O
here O
to O
read O
reviews O
before O
I O
purchased O
. O
  O
It O
's O
pretty O
, O
very O
powerful O
, O
and O
my O
only O
gripe O
is O
the O
buttons O
are O
reversed O
from O
my O
last O
dryer O
so O
I O
'm O
constantly O
making O
it O
hotter O
instead O
of O
turning O
it O
off O
:) O

great O
product O
. O
  O
This O
is O
the O
second O
one O
I O
have O
bought O
, O
to O
give O
to O
my O
niece O
as O
a O
birthday O
gift O
since O
we O
love O
ours O
so O
much O
. O

Compact O
size O
makes O
this O
hair O
dryer O
great O
and O
easy O
to O
pack O
for O
weekend O
and/or O
longer O
trips O
. O

This O
little O
dryer O
works O
great O
, O
but O
a O
few O
words O
of O
advice O
if O
you O
are O
traveling O
outside O
of O
the O
US O
. O
  O
I O
went O
to O
Italy O
so O
I O
set O
the O
switch O
for O
220v O
before O
I O
left O
so O
I O
would O
n't O
forget O
. O
  O
The O
first O
time O
I O
plugged O
it O
in O
( O
with O
an O
adapter O
) O
, O
I O
double O
checked O
to O
ensure O
it O
was O
set O
to O
220 O
. O
  O
I O
switched O
it O
on O
low O
and O
it O
was O
working O
fine O
. O
  O
I O
then O
switched O
it O
on O
high O
, O
and O
within O
seconds O
it O
became O
red O
hot O
. O
  O
I O
looked O
at O
it O
and O
immediately O
pulled O
the O
plug O
as O
it O
was O
just O
about O
to O
shoot O
flames O
. O
  O
When O
I O
looked O
at O
the O
voltage O
, O
it O
had O
changed O
back O
to O
110 O
. O
  O
With O
the O
dryer O
unplugged O
, O
I O
set O
it O
back O
to O
220 O
and O
toggled O
the O
hi O
/ O
lo O
switch O
. O
  O
What O
I O
realized O
is O
that O
it O
worked O
fine O
on O
the O
low O
setting O
. O
  O
The O
moment O
the O
setting O
was O
changed O
to O
hi O
, O
it O
also O
changed O
the O
voltage O
back O
to O
110 O
. O
  O
Once O
I O
got O
this O
figured O
out O
, O
I O
used O
it O
on O
low O
for O
the O
entire O
trip O
with O
no O
issues O
. O
  O
Low O
was O
enough O
to O
dry O
my O
shoulder O
length O
hair O
. O

works O
very O
well O

Cord O
no O
longer O
retracts O
. O

This O
hairdryer O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
. O
  O
Although O
it O
's O
a O
bit O
on O
the O
heavy O
side O
, O
its O
compact O
frame O
and O
powerful O
air O
flow O
fully O
compensate O
that O
one O
drawback O
. O
  O
One O
of O
the O
best O
hairdryers O
I O
have O
owned O
. O

buenisimo O

Love O
hair O
dryer O
. O
Wish O
the O
cord O
was O
longer O
like O
the O
original O
dryer O
purchased O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
! O
  O
Why O
did O
they O
shorten O
cord O
? O
? O

I O
purchased O
this O
to O
use O
on O
a O
trip O
to O
England O
and O
Ireland O
. O
I O
was O
VERY O
happy O
with O
it O
! O
It O
is O
very O
small O
, O
lightweight O
, O
and O
high O
powered O
. O
I O
would O
n't O
want O
to O
use O
to O
all O
the O
time O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
very O
happy O
with O
it O
for O
travel O
. O

So O
happy O
I O
finally O
bought O
this O
dryer O
for O
my O
bathroom O
. O
  O
It O
has O
great O
power O
but O
can O
be O
gentle O
with O
the O
lower O
speed O
. O

I O
have O
extremely O
curly O
hair O
and O
this O
dryer O
is O
perfect O
for O
me O
. O
  O
It O
's O
a O
little O
loud O
but O
worth O
it O
! O

This O
is O
a O
replacement O
for O
the O
one O
I O
have O
had O
for O
many O
years O
. O

I O
really O
like O
this O
dryer O
, O
ti O
does O
the O
job O
well O
, O
  O
I O
have O
  O
not O
used O
the O
attachment O
since O
I O
have O
short O
hair O
, O
So O
I O
have O
to O
review O
just O
the O
hair O
dryer O
alone O
it O
's O
really O
good O
, O
I O
recommend O
this O
one O
. O
Plenty O
of O
choices O
for O
air O
flow O
. O

Works O
as O
a O
blow O
drier O
but O
not O
as O
well O
as O
the O
RV544 O
for O
just O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
money O
. O

Fabulous O
little O
dryer O
will O
never O
go O
back O
to O
another O
type O
. O
Great O
settings O
lots O
of O
power O
! O
Hangs O
out O
of O
the O
way O
yet O
right O
there O
when O
you O
need O
it O
! O

This O
is O
the O
best O
dyer O
I O
have O
ever O
used O
! O
! O
! O
! O
I O
have O
frizzy O
curly O
hair O
and O
when O
I O
use O
this O
dyer O
my O
hair O
comes O
out O
smooth O
and O
straight O
... O

I O
use O
the O
concentrator O
every O
time O
I O
dry O
my O
hair O
. O
It O
falls O
off O
at O
least O
10 O
times O
. O
It O
gets O
really O
hot O
too O
so O
it O
's O
a O
pain O
to O
put O
back O
on O
constantly O
. O
The O
dryer O
is O
good O
. O
Just O
wish O
the O
attachments O
stayed O
in O
place O
. O

great O
dryer O
and O
delivered O
in O
just O
three O
days O

bought O
for O
my O
11 O
- O
year O
old O
daughter O
, O
she O
loves O
it O
. O
  O
the O
price O
was O
just O
right O
, O
and O
it O
's O
simple O
to O
use O
. O
Pretty O
decent O
power O
, O
and O
the O
cold O
shot O
button O
works O
great O
without O
losing O
power O
( O
like O
some O
I O
have O
owned O
) O
. O
  O
Would O
recommend O
as O
a O
great O
basic O
hair O
dryer O
. O

Great O
item-- O
quick O
service O
-- O
thanks O
! O

Compact O
and O
powerful O
. O

Travelled O
to O
Brazil O
and O
were O
a O
bit O
afraid O
that O
for O
the O
value O
it O
would O
actually O
work O
well O
on O
220v O
outlets O
, O
but O
it O
works O
great O
so O
far O
! O
Only O
problem O
is O
the O
attachment O
is O
very O
lose O
and O
does O
not O
stay O
on O
, O
falling O
easily O
and O
frequently O
while O
drying O
my O
hair O
. O
But O
still O
, O
I O
recommend O
it O
! O

There O
are O
not O
3 O
levels O
of O
heat O
. O
There O
ARE O
3 O
levels O
of O
blowing O
air O
, O
but O
I O
wish O
the O
heat O
was O
different O
. O
Not O
what O
I O
expected O
. O
I O
do O
like O
the O
retractable O
cord O
for O
the O
convenience O
of O
storage O
. O
I O
've O
used O
the O
dryer O
for O
about O
3 O
weeks O
. O

Love O
the O
built O
in O
nightlight O

love O
this O
dryer O
. O
  O
it O
's O
quiet O
but O
powerful O
, O
and O
the O
' O
cold O
' O
button O
really O
works O
without O
losing O
power O
! O
( O
unlike O
the O
last O
dryer O
I O
had O
) O
. O
other O
reviewers O
mentioned O
it O
's O
weight O
, O
and O
yes O
it O
does O
feel O
more O
weighty O
than O
some O
dryers O
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O
a O
problem O
for O
me O
, O
sorta O
feels O
like O
it O
's O
more O
industrial O
and O
not O
cheap O
. O
  O
the O
outside O
texture O
of O
the O
dryer O
is O
nice O
too O
. O
  O
overall O
I O
think O
it O
was O
a O
great O
buy O
! O

The O
only O
con O
is O
that O
it O
does O
n't O
reach O
the O
back O
of O
my O
head O
. O
I O
'd O
have O
to O
put O
a O
pillow O
under O
my O
butt O
and O
lower O
my O
head O
and O
just O
sit O
there O
for O
a O
while O
, O
and O
that O
cramps O
up O
my O
neck O
a O
lot O
:( O

Works O
great O
! O
  O
Love O
the O
retractable O
cord O
! O
! O
  O
It O
does O
go O
back O
in O
fast O
so O
I O
hang O
on O
the O
the O
plug O
( O
lightly O
) O
until O
its O
retracted O
so O
the O
plug O
does O
n't O
swing O
around O
and O
hit O
something O
. O

This O
is O
my O
second O
one O
. O
The O
first O
one O
has O
been O
  O
broken O
while O
moving O
home O
. O
I O
would O
say O
it O
is O
a O
product O
worth O
its O
price O
. O
Great O
deal O
. O

This O
hair O
dryer O
does O
n't O
function O
well O
after O
I O
used O
it O
for O
a O
month O
. O
It O
just O
suddenly O
became O
so O
hot O
and O
the O
wind O
was O
not O
as O
strong O
as O
before O
. O
Also O
it O
is O
a O
little O
bit O
heavy O
. O

Too O
loud O
! O
All O
the O
descriptions O
about O
the O
noise O
is O
true O
. O
And O
the O
low O
setting O
is O
too O
low O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
write O
many O
reviews O
; O
but O
this O
hair O
dryer O
is O
the O
absolute O
best O
that O
I O
have O
ever O
owned O
and O
very O
reasonably O
priced O
. O
  O
I O
live O
in O
humid O
south O
Florida O
and O
have O
shoulder O
length O
thick O
hair O
that O
tends O
to O
frizz O
. O
  O
I O
have O
always O
taken O
care O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
carefully O
and O
thoroughly O
with O
a O
round O
brush O
; O
however O
, O
after O
a O
stint O
in O
the O
Florida O
heat O
I O
am O
all O
frizz O
again O
. O
  O
I O
decided O
to O
upgrade O
my O
hair O
dryer O
and O
read O
many O
reviews O
before O
selecting O
this O
one O
. O
  O
I O
do O
have O
to O
add O
that O
most O
of O
the O
recommended O
hair O
dryers O
were O
priced O
well O
over O
$ O
50 O
which O
just O
seems O
like O
too O
much O
to O
me O
. O
  O
The O
Remington O
AC9096 O
had O
both O
great O
reviews O
and O
a O
reasonable O
price O
and O
best O
of O
all O
-- O
IT O
WORKS O
. O
  O
I O
can O
dry O
my O
hair O
very O
quickly O
with O
this O
dryer O
using O
a O
large O
round O
brush O
and O
the O
end O
result O
is O
soft O
, O
smooth O
, O
shiny O
, O
frizz O
- O
free O
hair O
that O
stays O
frizz O
free O
even O
when O
I O
am O
outdoors O
. O
  O
I O
have O
not O
had O
any O
issues O
with O
my O
hair O
getting O
caught O
on O
the O
dryer O
, O
but O
like O
I O
said O
, O
  O
my O
hair O
is O
only O
shoulder O
length O
. O
If O
you O
have O
hair O
that O
tends O
to O
frizz O
in O
the O
humidity O
, O
  O
buy O
this O
dryer O
. O
  O
You O
will O
not O
regret O
it O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
hair O
dryer O
recently O
but O
i O
ordered O
a O
comb O
attachment O
and O
it O
can O
not O
fit O
... O
So O
i O
bought O
another O
different O
one O
that O
which O
is O
bigger O
and O
they O
said O
was O
universal O
an O
it O
wo O
nt O
fit O
either O
.. O
They O
both O
are O
too O
small O
to O
fit O
.. O
Can O
anyone O
tell O
me O
a O
size O
comb O
attachment O
i O
can O
buy O
that O
would O
fit O
on O
this O
hair O
dryer O
please O

This O
blowdryer O
caused O
outages O
each O
time O
I O
used O
it O
so O
I O
had O
to O
stop O
and O
buy O
a O
new O
one O
! O
! O

Pretty O
good O
for O
a O
home O
device O

I O
bought O
this O
hair O
dryer O
at O
Target O
several O
years O
ago O
, O
and O
was O
SOOO O
impressed O
with O
the O
power O
, O
that O
I O
would O
randomly O
talk O
to O
people O
about O
my O
new O
hair O
dryer O
! O
! O
  O
I O
had O
long O
hair O
at O
the O
time O
, O
and O
it O
cut O
drying O
time O
down O
significantly O
. O
  O
Also O
left O
my O
waivy O
hair O
perfectly O
straight O
and O
silky O
smooth O
. O
I O
do O
think O
after O
a O
few O
years O
, O
the O
Ion O
starts O
to O
lose O
effectiveness O
( O
on O
all O
hair O
dryers O
I O
've O
ever O
had O
) O
. O
  O
I O
had O
it O
for O
at O
least O
4 O
years O
, O
before O
the O
back O
filter O
broke O
, O
and O
then O
my O
hair O
started O
getting O
sucked O
into O
the O
back O
. O
So O
I O
tried O
several O
different O
dryers O
, O
even O
expensive O
name O
brand O
ones O
like O
Babyliss O
, O
none O
that O
I O
really O
LOVED O
like O
this O
one O
. O
  O
I O
recently O
chopped O
my O
hair O
off O
, O
and O
am O
using O
a O
less O
powerful O
dryer O
. O
  O
But O
after O
realizing O
my O
love O
for O
this O
dryer O
, O
I O
went O
ahead O
and O
bought O
a O
second O
one O
, O
and O
have O
it O
put O
up O
in O
my O
closet O
, O
to O
use O
again O
once O
my O
hair O
grows O
back O
out O
, O
and O
I O
need O
that O
' O
power O
' O
to O
straighten O
and O
dry O
quicklyOnly O
CON O
is O
that O
is O
IS O
a O
bit O
heavy O
... O
after O
having O
no O
luck O
with O
lighter O
ones O
, O
I O
realize O
the O
weight O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
being O
one O
third O
the O
size O
and O
significantly O
lighter O
than O
my O
old O
dryer O
, O
it O
did O
the O
job O
in O
half O
the O
time O
of O
my O
more O
powerful O
unit O
with O
the O
same O
technology O
. O
  O
One O
other O
reviewer O
said O
that O
it O
burnt O
out O
after O
2 O
weeks O
, O
but O
if O
it O
lasts O
I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
it O
. O

I O
used O
this O
hairdryer O
at O
a O
hotel O
and O
came O
home O
and O
bought O
one O
. O
  O
It O
is O
lightweight O
, O
and O
my O
favorite O
feature O
is O
that O
you O
can O
have O
high O
air O
with O
low O
heat O
. O
  O
Simple O
, O
cheap O
, O
and O
works O
very O
well O
! O

After O
limited O
use O
in O
5 O
months O
, O
the O
unit O
only O
works O
on O
low O
. O
Will O
need O
to O
get O
a O
replacement O
. O

over O
heats O
quickly O
, O
do O
not O
recomment O

Best O
hair O
dryer O
! O
Same O
dryer O
as O
my O
hair O
stylist O
. O

It O
's O
a O
good O
product O
to O
buy O
. O
it O
's O
very O
useful O
. O

good O

Works O
good O
and O
outside O
stays O
cool O
. O
  O
Durable O
and O
heats O
and O
cools O
quickly O
. O
  O
Turbo O
mode O
great O
. O
  O
Be O
aware O
this O
dryer O
is O
very O
large O
. O
  O
The O
plastic O
hair O
thingy O
is O
a O
gimmick O
, O
but O
the O
dryer O
is O
good O
. O

This O
dryer O
works O
well O
. O
I O
think O
the O
temps O
are O
perfect O
for O
my O
hair O
( O
very O
fine O
) O
. O
My O
spouse O
thinks O
it O
's O
not O
quite O
hot O
enough O
( O
thick O
hair O
) O
. O
I O
love O
the O
different O
fan O
settings O
on O
inner O
handle O
. O
The O
cool O
button O
does O
not O
change O
the O
fan O
speed O
, O
only O
the O
temp O
. O
I O
have O
had O
this O
for O
a O
few O
months O
now O
, O
and O
it O
really O
does O
a O
nice O
job O
. O

Great O
lightweight O
hair O
dryer O
with O
2 O
speeds O
, O
worked O
well O
in O
Italy O
. O
  O
Might O
be O
difficult O
to O
change O
to O
US O
current O
, O
but O
I O
will O
keep O
it O
for O
the O
next O
trip O
overseas O
. O

well O
pleased O

Light O

I O
reall O
like O

  O
Nice O
, O
powerful O

excellent O

Works O
great O

Great O
buy O
. O
  O
Works O
just O
as O
advertised O

very O
nice O
very O
powerful O
and O
I O
like O
the O
folding O
handle O
. O
dries O
my O
hair O
in O
no O
time O
! O

Great O
hairdryer O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
get O
the O
round O
attachment O
brush O
and O
I O
wanted O
that O
. O
I O
tried O
to O
find O
a O
way O
to O
let O
the O
know O
but O
did O
n't O
because O
the O
writing O
was O
Asian O
l O
will O
continue O
to O
try O
to O
order O
the O
round O
attachment O

This O
little O
dryer O
is O
really O
easy O
to O
take O
on O
the O
go O
. O
  O
It O
gets O
really O
hot O
, O
which O
is O
good O
for O
my O
incredibly O
thick O
hair O
, O
but O
it O
's O
great O
to O
have O
the O
cooling O
button O
on O
it O
. O
  O
It O
is O
a O
loud O
little O
bugger O
however O
! O
  O
Anyway O
, O
it O
's O
a O
good O
purchase O
. O
  O
I O
've O
used O
it O
several O
dozen O
times O
on O
trips O
in O
the O
States O
and O
in O
Europe O
and O
it O
's O
served O
its O
purpose O
. O

Save O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
! O

Small O
, O
light O
in O
weight O
& O
easy O
to O
use O
. O
It O
does O
the O
job O
& O
I O
love O
it O
! O

Very O
good O
product O
. O
It O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
get O
that O
hot O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
just O
needs O
time O
to O
get O
broken O
in O
, O
or O
if O
the O
infrared O
technology O
just O
does O
n't O
need O
the O
high O
heat O
. O
Runs O
VERY O
quietly O
and O
its O
built O
like O
a O
tank O
. O

It O
was O
OK O
- O
liked O
the O
heaviness O
of O
it O
but O
was O
nothing O
more O
than O
just O
a O
drugstore O
blow O
dryer O
. O
Was O
hoping O
for O
  O
more O
of O
a O
difference O
due O
to O
the O
Tourmaline O
Ceramic O
name O
but O
nothing O
special O
or O
different O
than O
my O
last O
Conair O
blow O
dryer O
. O

my O
wife O
loves O
it O
. O

Its O
ok O
... O
light O
weight O
but O
noisey O
. O

I O
would O
not O
purchase O
this O
product O
. O
This O
blower O
dryer O
arbitrarily O
cuts O
out O
during O
blow O
drying O
. O
It O
does O
come O
back O
on O
after O
a O
couple O
of O
minutes O
, O
but O
I O
've O
never O
had O
a O
blow O
dryer O
do O
that O
before O
. O

Nice O
and O
does O
not O
fry O
hair O
! O

Great O
power O
! O
Shortened O
my O
drying O
time O
quite O
a O
bit O
. O

Great O
wall O
mount O
dryer O
. O

very O
good O

We O
found O
this O
at O
a O
local O
store O
just O
looking O
for O
a O
cheep O
hair O
dryer O
, O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
am O
incredibly O
impressed O
with O
its O
performance O
. O
We O
have O
had O
this O
running O
for O
a O
minimum O
of O
three O
hours O
straight O
and O
it O
has O
n't O
skipped O
a O
beat O
! O
First O
time O
we O
used O
it O
, O
we O
forgot O
to O
press O
the O
cool O
air O
button O
and O
ended O
up O
melting O
PVC O
pipe O
, O
so O
as O
far O
as O
heat O
goes O
, O
this O
thing O
is O
awesome O
. O
Its O
heat O
resistance O
is O
also O
pretty O
impressive O
! O
We O
have O
had O
it O
right O
up O
next O
to O
  O
about O
1200 O
° O
F O
and O
it O
kept O
working O
( O
it O
had O
a O
bit O
of O
distance O
from O
the O
heat O
since O
we O
connected O
it O
to O
PVC O
pipe O
, O
but O
the O
PVC O
funneled O
heat O
right O
into O
the O
dryer O
when O
it O
was O
off O
) O
. O
Today O
we O
even O
had O
it O
next O
to O
about O
1300 O
° O
F O
and O
not O
a O
thing O
went O
wrong O
! O
So O
all O
in O
all O
we O
have O
ran O
this O
in O
pretty O
intense O
environments O
and O
it O
has O
n't O
failed O
us O
yet O
. O
We O
've O
ran O
it O
4 O
times O
like O
this O
and O
it O
was O
able O
to O
preform O
perfectly O
each O
time O
. O
Only O
problem O
we O
had O
was O
that O
at O
around O
hour O
2 O
the O
first O
time O
we O
used O
it O
, O
the O
back O
started O
to O
smoke O
. O
We O
thought O
that O
maybe O
we O
had O
bought O
a O
cheep O
dryer O
and O
that O
we O
'd O
need O
a O
different O
one O
, O
but O
soon O
after O
it O
stopped O
and O
has O
n't O
done O
it O
since O
. O
We O
were O
using O
it O
in O
a O
small O
drizzle O
which O
might O
impact O
performance O
, O
so O
do O
n't O
use O
it O
for O
2 O
hours O
in O
a O
slight O
drizzle O
. O
Once O
it O
started O
really O
raining O
, O
we O
moved O
into O
a O
garage O
and O
continued O
using O
it O
, O
and O
after O
that O
it O
stopped O
smoking O
. O
But O
all O
in O
all O
I O
'd O
say O
that O
it O
is O
a O
very O
good O
purchase O
for O
a O
low O
price O
. O
Once O
ours O
busts O
I O
will O
most O
likely O
purchase O
another O
Revlon O
. O

Love O
this O
dryer O
! O
Had O
it O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
and O
it O
's O
still O
going O
strong O
. O
Powerful O
and O
HOT O
! O

I O
love O
it O
! O

I O
love O
this O
hairdryer O
. O
It O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
power O
and O
I O
like O
that O
it O
has O
three O
heat O
settings O
as O
well O
as O
two O
fan O
settings O
. O
  O
It O
is O
not O
too O
loud O
and O
not O
too O
heavy O
. O

Love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
for O
the O
price O
! O

I O
love O
this O
in O
that O
it O
dries O
my O
hair O
fast O
. O
Hood O
needs O
to O
be O
deeper O
- O
but O
does O
the O
trick O
. O
  O
My O
hair O
is O
short O
- O
could O
be O
hard O
for O
someone O
with O
long O
hair O
. O

Very O
happy O
with O
this O
hair O
dryer O
, O
and O
the O
price O
! O
  O
I O
have O
baby O
fine O
hair O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
able O
to O
dry O
it O
without O
leaving O
it O
all O
frizzy O
. O
  O
I O
clung O
to O
my O
1500 O
watt O
blowdryer O
for O
years O
, O
until O
it O
finally O
died O
, O
since O
the O
1800 O
- O
watt O
dryers O
I O
'd O
tried O
had O
all O
given O
me O
dismal O
results O
. O
  O
Maybe O
it O
's O
the O
ceramic O
that O
makes O
the O
difference O
- O
but O
in O
any O
event O
I O
am O
pleased O
with O
this O
purchase O
! O

Just O
as O
fast O
drying O
as O
promised O
. O
  O
Glad O
for O
the O
force O
choices O
. O
  O
The O
high O
speed O
seems O
to O
tangle O
my O
straight O
bob O

Fit O
right O
where O
the O
old O
dyers O
was O
mounted O
. O
Great O
replacement O
for O
a O
reasonable O
cost O
. O

The O
dryer O
has O
several O
good O
features O
, O
and O
I O
especially O
appreciate O
the O
cool O
setting O
and O
how O
the O
cool O
button O
delivers O
air O
with O
absolutely O
no O
heat O
at O
all O
. O
  O
Other O
dryers O
I O
've O
had O
have O
produced O
still O
slightly O
warm O
heat O
even O
when O
the O
cool O
button O
is O
used O
. O
  O
Not O
this O
one O
! O
! O
! O
! O
  O
The O
downside O
for O
this O
dryer O
is O
the O
diffuser O
attachment O
. O
  O
It O
is O
much O
too O
small O
and O
does O
not O
diffuse O
well O
enough O
to O
not O
have O
my O
fine O
2 O
b O
/ O
c O
wavy O
hair O
not O
blow O
all O
over O
. O
  O
Luckily O
I O
was O
able O
to O
use O
a O
diffuser O
attachment O
from O
my O
dryer O
that O
fried O
recently O
( O
prompting O
this O
purchase O
) O
. O
  O
Otherwise O
I O
would O
have O
had O
to O
return O
this O
dryer O
, O
even O
as O
much O
as O
I O
'm O
loving O
the O
cool O
air O
feature O
. O
  O
Hence O
only O
a O
three O
star O
rating O
. O

I O
was O
so O
excited O
to O
use O
this O
hair O
dryer O
for O
the O
first O
couple O
of O
months O
, O
then O
ad O
some O
of O
the O
other O
customer O
reviews O
had O
stated O
it O
quit O
working O
. O
  O
The O
heating O
part O
of O
it O
just O
stopped O
about O
6 O
months O
in O
. O
So O
sad O
:-( O

I O
bought O
this O
to O
replace O
my O
aging O
Hot O
Tools O
dryer O
. O
The O
air O
flow O
is O
weak O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
get O
very O
hot O
, O
and O
there O
are O
n't O
any O
vents O
near O
the O
nape O
of O
my O
neck O
, O
so O
the O
back O
of O
my O
hair O
is O
never O
dry O
. O
I O
would O
return O
it O
if O
I O
still O
had O
the O
box O
. O

Wow O
. O
  O
Honestly O
, O
I O
was O
a O
bit O
skeptical O
about O
whether O
there O
would O
be O
any O
difference O
between O
this O
hairdryer O

TechnologyRather O
amazing O
technology O
here O
from O
the O
engineers O
at O
Panasonic O
. O
  O
Using O
a O
high O
electric O
potential O
they O
create O
negative O
ions O
which O
trap O
water O
molecules O
from O
the O
air O
and O
combine O
them O
with O
the O
hot O
air O
jet O
of O
a O
conventional O
dryer O
. O
  O
By O
doing O
this O
, O
they O
buffer O
the O
air O
jet O
with O
moisture O
which O
in O
turn O
prevents O
damage O
to O
hair O
. O
  O
Panasonic O
has O
been O
leaders O
in O
this O
area O
of O
technology O
which O
is O
why O
Japan O
enjoys O
the O
best O
selection O

The O
ResultsAs O
other O
reviewers O
have O
pointed O
out O
, O
hair O
is O
dried O
quicker O
and O
with O
softer O
, O
shinier O
results O
! O
  O
My O
hair O
is O
short O
, O
but O
for O
most O
women O
with O
longer O
hair O
, O
the O
results O
should O
be O
even O
better O
! O
  O
It O
is O
designed O
to O
run O
cooler O
to O
protect O
hair O
from O
heat O
, O
so O
if O
you O
dry O
your O
hair O
everyday O
you O
would O
significantly O
reduce O
cumulative O
damage O
to O
hair O
. O
Before O
you O
use O
: O
You O
must O
be O
aware O
of O
the O
electrical O
requirements O
for O
using O
this O
fine O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
Since O
it O
was O
designed O
for O
the O
Japanese O
domestic O
market O
, O
it O
is O
made O
for O
their O
electrical O
system O
, O
not O
the O
U.S. O
  O
Although O
the O
plugs O
in O
Japan O
and O
the O
U.S. O
look O
the O
same O
, O
the O
electricity O
supply O
is O
very O
different O
. O
  O
I O
am O
an O
electrical O
engineer O
and O
I O
have O
lived O
in O
Japan O
, O
continue O
to O
use O
many O
Japanese O
products O
in O
the O
U.S. O
so O
I O
understand O
the O
differences O
well O
and O
how O
to O
work O
around O
them O
. O
  O
In O
Japan O
they O
use O
100 O
volts O
, O
however O
in O
the O
U.S. O
we O
use O
120 O
volts O
. O
  O
That O
means O
by O
plugging O
in O
a O
Japanese O
product O
directly O
into O
the O
U.S. O
system O
, O
you O
would O
overload O
the O
product O
by O
20 O
% O
. O
  O
For O
a O
high O
wattage O
device O
like O
a O
hair O
dryer O
that O
is O
a O
considerable O
amount O
over O
the O
intended O
design O
! O
  O
Indeed O
some O
other O
reviewers O

posted O

they O
were O

not O

that O
it O

n't O
too O
loud O

  O
It O

a O
good O
hair O

a O

This O

a O
new O
kind O
of O
dryer O
for O

It O
has O
an O
ionizer O

it O

something O
similar O
to O
that O

When O
the O

is O
an O

I O
have O
very O
thick O
hair O

it O
takes O
me O
forever O

dry O
it O

This O
hair O
dryer O
cut O
that O
time O
down O
significantly O

I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
it O

Another O
great O
product O

You O
have O
many O

you O

the O
retractable O

a O
real O

hang O
my O
blow O
dryer O
in O
a O
over O
the O
door O
hair O
product O

  O

it O
's O

close O
the O

now O
without O
a O

way O

I O
have O
very O
fine O
, O
short O
hair O
and O
this O
dryer O
fluffed O
it O
up O
nicely O
and O
it O
's O
very O
fast O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
like O
that O
the O
diffuser O
does O
n't O
prevent O
my O
hair O
from O
blowing O
all O
over O
the O
place O
when O
I O
'm O
trying O

  O
It O

good O
power O

I O
had O
high O
hopes O

this O

on O
the O
reviews O

it O
's O
marginal O
at O
best O

  O
The O
heat O

pretty O
weak O

and O
if O
you O
have O
a O
ton O
of O
hair O
, O
forget O
about O
it O
. O
  O
For O
me O
, O
I O
'll O
keep O
using O
it O
, O
but O
my O
wife O
said O
she O
'd O
never O
be O
able O
to O
use O
this O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O

  O
Saves O

on O
the O
counter O

compact O
size O

HI O
setting O
is O
strong O
. O
Cons O
: O
  O
It O
only O
lasted O
two O
years O
and O
one O
month O
. O
  O
Had O
to O
re O
- O
order O
one O
again O
today O
because O
we O
had O
already O
installed O
the O
metal O
panel O
on O
the O
wall O
and O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
have O
to O
take O
it O
off O
and O
repaint O
and O
redo O
it O
all O
. O
Hopefully O
this O
new O
one O
will O
come O
soon O
and O
last O
longer O
. O
We O
shall O
see O
... O

Same O
weight O
as O
my O
old O
big O
dryer O
. O
  O
Not O
lightweight O
! O

Overall O
a O
great O
hair O
dryer O
, O
but O
since O
the O
outer O
shell O
along O
with O
attachable O
head O
nozzles O
are O
plastic O
, O
it O
can O
emit O
a O
somewhat O
funky O
smell O
if O
left O
on O
for O
too O
long O
and O
on O
too O
high O
of O
a O
temperature O

research O
smaller O

this O

my O

am O
a O
guy O
with O
short O
hair O
- O
so O
I O
barely O
use O
it O
daily O
) O
. O
  O
It O
malfunctioned O
only O
THREE O
months O
later O
in O
June O
2015 O
. O
  O
I O
was O
drying O
my O
hair O
one O
morning O
and O
flames O
shot O
from O
the O
dryer O
at O
my O
head O
- O
I O
did O
not O
get O
burned O
( O
nor O
did O
my O
hair O
) O
but O
it O
was O
pretty O
surreal O
to O
see O
the O
dryer O
nearly O
on O
fire O
. O
  O
Unfortunately O
, O
they O
are O
no O
longer O
available O
- O
I O
have O
no O
way O
to O
contact O
the O
seller O
and O
so O
I O
am O
stuck O
buying O
another O
dryer O
. O
I O
have O
included O
a O
picture O
to O
show O
the O
extent O
of O
the O
glowing O
fire O
at O
the O
end O
of O
this O
dyer O
. O
  O
Buy O
this O
Allure O
hair O
dryer O
at O
your O
own O
risk O
! O
  O
If O
the O
seller O
reads O
this O
review O
- O
I O
would O
appreciate O
being O
contacted O
for O
replacement O
. O
  O
Thanks O
! O

Like O
it O
but O
the O
cord O
needs O
assistance O
retracting O
and O
could O
have O
more O
power O
. O

Wife O
loves O
it O
. O

GF O
brought O
it O
and O
loves O
it O
. O
I O
am O
a O
guy O
and O
do O
n't O
use O
it O
myself O
. O

Works O
like O
a O
professional O
hair O
dryer O
should O
. O

good O
product O

Works O
excellently O
. O
  O
Can O
easily O
clean O
out O
the O
air O
intake O
grill O
- O
work O
. O
  O
Only O
wish O
the O
mounting O
to O
the O
wall O
plate O
was O
more O
secure O
. O

Nice O
cheap O
dryer O
. O

great O
product O
for O
a O
great O
value O
. O
honestly O
was O
worried O
about O
the O
price O
point O
at O
first O
but O
it O
was O
a O
good O
buy O
:) O

Nice O
, O
sturdy O
good O
quality O
. O
  O
Have O
n't O
used O
it O
yet O
but O
plugged O
it O
in O
and O
waited O
a O
while O
for O
it O
to O
get O
hot O
but O
had O
to O
turn O
it O
off O
before O
it O
actually O
produced O
real O
heat O
. O

I O
got O
this O
hair O
dryer O
to O
replace O
a O
dryer O
I O
had O
for O
several O
years O
. O
  O
This O
one O
is O
really O
good O
. O
  O
It O
provides O
a O
good O
flow O
of O
air O
and O
has O
3 O
different O
heat O
settings O
and O
speed O
settings O
. O
I O
would O
recommend O
it O
. O

I O
thought O
I O
was O
buying O
the O
same O
dryer O
as O
my O
old O
one O
. O
  O
This O
one O
takes O
much O
longer O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
and O
the O
cord O
is O
not O
as O
long O
. O

It O
was O
n't O
as O
I O
expected O
. O
I O
HAD O
TO O
RETURN O
IT O
. O

perfect O

Great O
price O
. O

My O

and O
we O
had O
good O
luck O
with O
Conair O
in O
the O
past O
, O
so O
I O
thought O
I O
would O
try O

new O
model O
which O
was O
just O
introduced O
. O
  O
Works O
really O
great O
, O
and O

. O
  O
Absolutely O
would O
recommend O
it O
! O
  O
5 O
Stars O
. O

Sending O
it O
back O
. O
  O
Blows O
too O
hard O
on O
high O
.... O
needs O
another O
speed O
besides O
low O
. O

Best O

Great O
dryer O

Wife O
thinks O
this O
thing O
is O
the O
best O
dryer O
she O
's O
ever O
had O
! O
  O
Claims O
it O
drys O
her O
hair O
quickly O
without O
leaving O
all O
the O
static O
. O
I O
would O
n't O
know O
since O
I O
'm O
bald O
but O
I O
'm O
glad O
I O
bought O
it O
for O
her O
. O

My O
wife O
loves O
it O
. O
A O
great O
Mothers O
Day O
present O

perfect O
for O
air O
travel O
as O
is O
compact O
and O
fits O
in O
my O
cloth O
bag O
- O
love O
that O
it O
has O
the O
diffuser O
. O

I O
've O
had O
this O
hairdryer O
for O
7 O
months O
, O
and O
today O
it O
died O
. O

Great O
dryer O
works O
fast O
and O
has O
a O
long O
cord O
so O
you O
can O
move O
around O
. O

This O
dryer O
is O
just O
what O
I O
wanted O
. O

The O
cord O
is O
so O
short O
I O
have O
to O
stand O
at O
the O
plug O

works O
great O
- O
the O
2 O
nozzles O
come O
on O
and O
off O
fine O
- O
much O
lighter O
than O
my O
previous O
dryer O
. O

Good O
dryer O
but O
the O
buttons O
are O
n't O
easy O
to O
move O
. O

I O
've O
never O
had O
it O
in O
me O
to O
buy O
an O
expensive O
blow O
dryer O
, O
so O
I O
'm O
no O
expert O
on O
dryers O
. O
But O
I O
'm O
very O
satisfied O
with O
this O
one O
. O
Very O
powerful O
and O
  O
you O
ca O
n't O
beat O
the O
price O

I O
love O
it O

Good O
, O
but O
ony O
lasted O
a O
year O
. O
  O
Did O
n't O
re O
- O
purchase O
, O
going O
back O
to O
Remington O
. O

Longer O
than O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
from O
the O
picture O
. O
  O
Actual O
dimensions O
are O
needed O
. O

Worka O
well O

While O
the O
weight O
is O
decent O
. O
it O
's O
not O
designed O
well O
from O
a O
hand O
- O
use O
perspective O
. O
Also O
- O
no O
cool O
setting O
. O
  O
Hot O

on O
low O
and O
high O

Great O
product O
! O
The O
retractable O
cord O
is O
really O
nice O
. O
The O
air O
does O
not O
add O
static O
to O
the O
hair O
. O
I O
wish O
it O
came O
in O
other O
color O
options O
. O

I O
have O
long O
, O
fine O
, O
and O
straight O
hair O
and O
this O
has O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
my O
go O
- O
to O
dryer O
. O
It O
gets O
hot O
enough O
but O
not O
too O
hot O
. O
It O
is O
perfect O
for O
styling O

Very O
happy O

Nice O
blow O
dryer O
so O
far O
had O
about O
a O
month O
blows O
very O
strong O
and O
gets O
pretty O
hot O
I O
have O
long O
very O
frizzy O
hair O
and O
blows O
it O
straight O
with O
a O
round O
brush O
pretty O
quickly O
. O
It O
's O
pretty O
heavy O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
mind O
the O
weight O
. O
4 O
stars O
due O
to O
nozzle O
falls O
off O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
push O
it O
in O
tight O
ever O
time O
you O
use O
it O
but O
other O
than O
that O
no O
complaints O
. O

I O
love O
it O
! O
It O
's O
not O
as O
strong O
as O
I O
expected O
, O
but O
my O
hair O
dries O
super O
fast O
. O

This O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
blow O
dryer O
I O
have O
ever O
owned O
. O
  O
I O
have O
longer O
thick O
hair O
and O
this O
dryer O
cuts O
my O
hair O
styling O
time O
in O
half O
. O
Light O
weight O
and O
easy O
to O
use O
. O
The O
only O
thing O
I O
would O
change O
is O
maybe O
the O
location O
of O
the O
switches O
. O
I O
find O
myself O
hitting O
the O
switches O
to O
easily O
when O
styling O
my O
hair O
. O

excellent O

Great O

and O
so O
easy O
to O
install O

Good O
power O
and O
nicely O

Exactly O
what O
I O
wanted O
. O
Excellent O
dryer O
. O

brush O
too O
soft O

gave O
it O

not O
100 O

as O
powerful O
as O
my O
old O
hair O
dryer O
, O
but O
its O
so O
compact O

gets O
the O
job O
done O
. O
  O
My O
hair O
feels O
a O
lot O
softer O
and O
not O
burnt O
, O
so O
the O
lower O
heat O
seems O
to O
be O
fine O
. O
  O
I O
ve O
only O
had O
it O
a O

so O
I O
ca O
nt O
say O
how O
long O
the O

retract O
works O
. O
  O
For O
$ O
20 O
, O
if O
it O
lasts O
a O
year O
its O
better O
than O
the O

I O
was O
looking O

, O
and O

Not O

Update O
: O
retractable O
cord O
does O
n't O
always O
fully O
retract O
. O
Still O
works O
fine O
. O
I O
would O
have O
liked O
an O
easier O
to O
clean O
one O
but O
this O
works O
. O
I O
use O
my O
shop O
vac O
to O
demolish O
the O
lint O
in O
the O
rear O
fan O
. O
For O
the O
price O
it O
's O
still O
a O
good O
bargain O
. O

POWERFUL O
AND O
NOT O
EXPENSIVE O
, O
IT O
'S O
THE O
PERFECT O
SIZE O
, O
LOVE O
IT O

wife O
likes O
it O

If O
I O
had O
only O
known O
what O
a O
difference O
a O
hair O
dryer O
can O
make O
for O
your O
hair O
. O
I O
admit O
that O
I O
love O
to O
buy O
beauty O
products O
, O
but O
especially O
hair O
products O
. O
My O
hair O
is O
colored O
/ O
highlighted O
, O
fairly O
straight O
, O
but O
not O
thin O
. O
Lately O
I O
keep O
buying O
products O
to O
take O
the O
dry O
frizz O
that O
seems O
to O
appear O
on O
the O
ends O
of O
my O
hair O
. O
Little O
did O
I O
know O
that O
using O
the O
Conair O
Tourmaline O
Hair O
Dryer O
would O
solve O
that O
problem O
immediately O
. O
The O
dryer O
has O
settings O
for O
the O
usual O
hot O
/ O
cold O
/ O
warm O
settings O
and O
high O
/ O
medium O
/ O
low O
... O
but O
it O
's O
nice O
to O
have O
the O
controls O
slide O
on O
either O
side O
of O
the O
device O
. O
It O
's O
a O
powerful O
1875 O
watts O
that O
dries O
my O
hair O
faster O
with O
ions O
and O
gives O
it O
body O
plus O
takes O
away O
the O
dry O
ends O
almost O
100 O
% O
. O
My O
co O
- O
workers O
noticed O
my O
hair O
looking O
better O
too O
. O
Ironically O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
always O
use O
a O
blow O
dryer O
because O
I O
want O
healthy O
hair O
, O
but O
this O
dryer O
seems O
to O
make O
my O
hair O
look O
better O
. O
For O
the O
price O
and O
function O
, O
I O
recommended O
this O
dryer O
. O

Disappointed O
- O
thought O
it O
would O
work O
on O
my O
hair O
... O
but O
made O
my O
curly O
hair O
straight O
... O
with O
the O
diffuser O
! O

The O
wife O
loves O
it! O
... O
the O
night O
light O
is O
bright O
, O
but O
not O
harsh O
! O

First O
discovered O
this O
brand O
of O
hairdryer O
at O
a O
hotel O
that O
my O
husband O
and O
I O
stayed O
at O
and O
loved O
so O
much O
that O
when O
we O
got O
home O
I O
went O
online O
to O
find O
one O
. O
  O
It O
is O
made O
very O
well O
, O
a O
little O
more O
expensive O
than O
what O
you O
would O
pay O
for O
one O
from O
walmart O
but O
that O
was O
okay O
with O
me O
. O
  O
I O
have O
n't O
always O
had O
good O
luck O
in O
the O
past O
with O
hairdryers O
but O
I O
think O

The O

nite O
lite O
. O

Love O
this O
dryer O
. O
  O
I O
specifically O
chose O
it O
because O
it O
is O
not O
as O
loud O
as O
others O
. O

I O
only O
got O
to O
use O
it O
1.5 O
times O
when O
I O
was O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
using O
it O
the O
second O
time O
when O
it O
sparked O
and O
burned O
out O
.... O
I O
would O
like O
a O
refund O
but O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
to O
go O
about O
it O
. O
I O
used O
to O
have O
one O
that O
lasted O
for O
10 O
years O
befo O
re O
ti O
burned O
out O

I O
purchased O
this O
item O
less O
than O
3 O
months O
ago O
. O
After O
using O
the O
product O
for O
about O
4 O
weeks O
, O
I O
noticed O
that O
the O
handle O
got O
incredibly O
hot O
... O
too O
hot O
for O
me O
to O
hold O
without O
it O
burning O
my O
hand O
. O
Today O
, O
less O
than O
12 O
weeks O
after O
purchasing O
, O
the O
hair O
dryer O
started O
smoking O
and O
completely O
shut O
down O
. O
Needless O
to O
say O
, O
I O
am O
very O
disappointed O
. O

Lots O
of O
power O
in O
this O
little O
guy O
- O
handle O
folds O
if O
storage O
is O
a O
problem O
in O
a O
drawer O
or O
a O
suitcase O
. O

Just O
okay O
.... O
doesnt O
seem O
to O
have O
a O
strong O
blowing O
power O
, O
and O
the O
on O
/ O
off O
switch O
is O
located O
on O
the O
handle O
right O
where O
you O
hold O
it O
which O
makes O
it O
turn O
off O
when O
you O
are O
using O
it O
. O
The O
filter O
door O
keeps O
popping O
open O
too O
.... O
I O
kept O
it O
, O
but O
not O
all O
that O
thrilled O
with O
it O
. O

Not O
very O
powerful O
and O
took O
me O
longer O
than O
usual O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
. O

Delivered O
on O
time O
... O
as O
described O

This O
is O
perfect O
for O
travel O
. O
  O
It O
is O
the O
smallest O
dryer O
I O
have O
seen O
, O
but O
it O
's O
power O
is O
not O
diminished O
. O

This O
hair O
dryer O
was O
all O
it O
was O
advertised O
to O
be O
. O
  O
It O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
use O
and O
light O
weight O
. O

The O
Elchim O
dryer O
is O
the O
worst O
hair O
dryer O
I O
have O
ever O
owned O
. O
  O
It O
is O
loud O
, O
controls O
are O
not O
easy O
to O
use O
, O
heavy O
and O
  O
no O
filters O
. O
  O
My O
current O
dryer O
is O
10 O
years O
old O
and O
IS O
a O
professional O
model O
, O
much O
nicer O
. O
  O
I O
gave O
this O
one O
to O
our O
Abused O
Women O
's O
Center O
. O
  O
In O
asking O
beauty O
salons O
about O

I O
did O
not O
find O
one O
hair O
stylist O
that O
was O
familiar O
with O
the O
name O
or O
had O
used O
it O
. O
  O
DON'T O
WASTE O
your O
money O
on O
this O
one O
, O
it O
is O
a O
piece O
of O
junk O

in O
my O
hotel O
room O
in O
Disney O
! O
I O
was O
using O
it O
and O
was O
really O
impressed O
with O
the O
speed O
at O
which O
is O
dried O
, O
the O
fullness O
of O
my O
hair O
and O
also O
the O
weight O
of O
the O
machine O
. O
Love O
the O
retractable O

. O
My O
hair O
is O
very O
fine O
and O
fly O

in O
the O
humid O
weather O
. O
My O
style O
held O
even O
in O
the O
Florida O

, O
I O
came O
home O
and O
ordered O
one O
. O
Love O
it O
! O

This O
is O
a O
replacement O
of O
the O
same O
blow O
dryer O
that O
I O
had O
purchased O
based O
on O
a O
recommendation O
from O
a O
magazine O
. O
The O
blow O
dryer O
is O
very O
light O
and O
had O
good O
power O
but O
failed O
completely O
in O
less O
than O
2 O
months O
. O
I O
have O
had O
the O
replacement O
for O
3 O
wks O
now O
and O
there O
are O
times O
the O

too O
is O
going O
to O
stop O
completely O
. O

Love O
this O
dryer O

my O
old O
dryer O
. O
  O
I O
have O
very O
thick O
long O
hair O
and O
it O
's O
so O
annoying O
to O
have O
to O
dry O
it O
but O
when O
I O
do O
this O
is O
the O
best O

A O
solid O

  O
Not O
high O

I O
have O
used O

1.5 O

in O
the O
salon O
i O

gets O
too O
hot O
so O
i O
rarely O
use O
it O
on O
high O
heat O
, O
the O
cold O
button O
is O
placed O
in O
a O
good O
spot O
, O
dryer O
tends O
to O
be O
a O
little O
heavy O
when O
using O
all O
the O
time O
. O
but O
it O
has O
n't O
given O
me O
any O
trouble O
, O
over O
all O
it O
was O
a O
good O
buy O
. O

I O
really O
like O
the O
hair O
dryer O
. O
The O
cool O
switch O
is O
great O
. O
In O
other O
hair O

I O
had O
to O
hold O
down O
the O
cold O
button O
. O
Does O
its O
Job O
. O

Excellent O

NOT O
travel O

It O
dries O
my O
hair O
quickly O
, O
and O
my O
hair O
dries O
very O
smooth O
and O
soft O
. O
I O
had O
an O
issue O
with O
the O
cord O
of O
mine O
not O
staying O
locked O
, O
but O
I O
was O
able O
to O
easily O
exchange O
it O
for O
the O
same O
hair O
dryer O
which O
did O
not O
have O
the O
locking O
problem O
. O
Must O
have O
been O
a O
fluke O
, O
but O
it O
was O
very O
easy O
to O
return O
! O

Dries O
nicely O
, O
not O
too O
loud O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
I O
really O
notice O
the O
Nanoe O
feature O
's O
effects O
compared O
to O
my O
old O
hair O
dryer O
, O
but O
I O
would O
still O
buy O
it O
again O
. O

Still O
works O
great O
but O
all O
the O
graphics O
came O
off O
within O
a O
week O
. O
If O
you O
have O
any O
product O
on O
your O
hands O
, O
expect O
the O
same O
results O
. O

Good O
hairdryer O
for O
the O
price O
. O
Some O
hair O
dryers O
really O
make O
my O
color O
treated O
hair O
look O
dry O
and O
frizzy O
. O
This O
one O
works O
well O
with O
my O
hair O
type O
to O
keep O
it O
looking O
smoother O
than O
the O
average O
dryer O

Nice O

years O

My O

Humidity O
makes O
it O
impossible O
to O
do O
anything O
but O
this O
hair O
dryer O
has O
helped O
tremendously O
. O

Tended O

instead O
of O
curl O

works O
as O

We O
were O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
quality O
, O
simple O
hair O
drier O
. O
This O
one O
seemed O
to O
fit O
the O
bill O
. O
It O
works O
well O
, O
dries O
hair O
quickly O
, O
and O
seems O
to O
help O
tame O
the O
Frizzies O
. O
We O
have O
been O
using O
it O
for O
quite O
a O
while O
now O
, O
and O
have O
had O
absolutely O
no O
issues O
with O
it O
. O

thanks O

Bought O
this O
for O
my O
wife O
once O
her O
previous O
( O
different O
brand O
) O
hair O
dryer O
broke O
. O
She O
has O
been O
raving O
about O
it O
ever O
since O
she O
got O
it O
. O
I O
definitely O
scored O
some O
major O
brownie O
points O
with O
this O
one O
. O
A O
couple O
of O
the O
things O
she O
has O
mentioned O
are O
how O
quickly O
it O
dries O
her O
hair O
in O
just O
seconds O
, O
how O
quiet O
it O
is O
while O
in O
use O
, O
and O
how O
fresh O
her O
hair O
feels O
after O
each O
use O
. O

My O
Wife O
Really O
Likes O
This O
Dryer O
, O
We O
Would O
Like O
Panasonic O
Extended O
Warranty O
! O

excellent O
! O

Best O
blowdryer O
I O
have O
ever O
owned O
. O
Well O
worth O
the O
money O
! O

I O
love O
this O
hair O
drywr O
. O
  O
At O
1600 O
watts O
it O
dries O
my O
hair O
rapidly O
. O
  O
It O
's O
compact O
size O
makes O
it O
lighter O
and O
easier O
to O
handle O
than O
those O
bulky O
dryers O
that O
must O
be O
held O
foot O
away O
from O
the O
head O
. O
  O
This O
is O
a O
real O
plus O
for O
folks O
with O
arthritis O
in O
the O
shoulder O
or O
neck O
joints O
. O
It O
fits O
easily O
into O
a O
drawer O
in O
the O
bathroom O
and O
it O
does O
n't O
take O
up O
much O
room O
in O
a O
suitcase O
for O
travel O
. O
  O
This O
is O
my O
second O
hair O
dryer O
of O
this O
type O
.. O
  O
The O
first O
one O
was O
purchased O
several O
years O
ago O
, O
and O
it O
still O
works O
perfectly O
even O
after O
4 O
- O
5 O
years O
of O
nearly O
daily O
use O
. O
  O
This O
unit O
was O
purchased O
as O
a O
replacement O
for O
a O
similar O
1200 O
watt O
dryer O
( O
different O
brand O
) O
that O
I O
kept O
in O
my O
swimming O
bag O
but O
that O
finally O
stopped O
working O
after O
30 O
years O
. O

Absolutely O
love O
this O
! O
Dries O
hair O
quickly O
without O
burning O
my O
hair O
! O

powerful O
and O
fast O
drying O

Worked O
well O
in O
Israel O
with O
adapter O
but O
only O
on O
low O
power O
despite O
changing O
the O
voltage O
. O
I O
thought O
I O
blew O
it O
out O
after O
only O
a O
few O
seconds O
on O
high O
power O
. O
Thankfully O
it O
worked O
on O
low O
a O
few O
minutes O
later O
when O
it O
cooled O
down O
. O
OverAll O
it O
did O
the O
job O
but O
def O
does O
n't O
replace O
a O
real O
blow O
dryer O
. O

Replaced O
a O
like O
unit O
which O
had O
lasted O
6 O
years O

Girlfriend O
loves O
it O
! O
Not O
too O
hot O
for O
hwr O
hair O
. O

does O
a O
great O
job O
! O

Great O
prpduct O
for O
the O
price O

I O
bought O
3 O
hair O
dryers O
at O
local O
stores O
and O
returned O
all O
three O
-- O
just O
not O
what O
I O
wanted O
. O
  O
I O
kept O
looking O
at O
the O
Rimini O
1800W O
Tourmaline O
Ionic O
Ceramic O
on O
Amazon O
-- O
it O
was O
the O
color O
that O
caught O
my O
eye O
first O
-- O
that O
beautiful O
blue O
. O
  O
After O
I O
returned O
the O
third O
dryer O
, O
I O
came O
back O
to O
the O
Rimini O
1800W. O
  O
I O
liked O
the O
way O
the O
dryer O
angled O
down O
, O
the O
controls O
looked O
high O
enough O
up O
so O
I O
would O
n't O
be O
changing O
the O
settings O
, O
and O
I O
especially O
loved O
the O
color O
! O
  O
Well O
, O
do O
n't O
let O
the O
color O
sway O
you O
. O
  O
I O
ordered O
the O
dryer O
, O
and O
it O
's O
fabulous O
! O
  O
It O
's O
full O
- O
sized O
, O
powerful O
, O
quiet O
, O
and O
my O
fingers O
do O
n't O
continually O
change O
the O
settings O
. O
  O
It O
takes O
me O
about O
4 O
minutes O
to O
completely O
dry O
my O
shoulder O
- O
length O
, O
straight O
hair O
, O
and O
that O
's O
at O
medium O
heat O
, O
high O
power O
. O
  O
I O
'm O
so O
pleased O
with O
this O
hair O
dryer O
, O
and O
did O
I O
mention O
that O
I O
love O
the O
beautiful O
blue O
color O
? O

I O
typically O
never O
write O
reviews O
, O
but O
felt O
compelled O
to O
after O
using O
this O
amazing O
product O
. O
My O
hair O
has O
never O
felt O
so O
good O
after O
using O
this O
dryer O
. O
It O
dries O
quickly O
and O
I O
barely O
needed O
to O
flat O
iron O
my O
hair O
when O
finished O
. O
My O
hair O
withstood O
the O
humidity O
better O
than O
ever O
as O
well O
. O
My O
hair O
is O
colored O
( O
blonde O
to O
boot O
) O
, O
damaged O
, O
wavy O
and O
frizzy O
and O
it O
honestly O
felt O
like O
a O
Pantene O
commercial O
after O
one O
use O
! O
I O
am O
a O
lifer O
with O
this O
hair O
dryer O
and O
thinking O
of O
buying O
a O
few O
to O
have O
back O
ups O
. O
Thank O
you O
Babyliss O
for O
making O
my O
hair O
the O
best O
it O
has O
ever O
been O
. O

A O
huge O
step O
up O
from O
the O
one O
it O
replaced O
. O
  O
Feels O
solid O
and O
works O
great O
. O

I O
've O
had O
this O
hair O
dryer O
for O
almost O
4 O
years O
now O
, O
and O
to O
this O
day O
I O
love O
it O
. O
I O
have O
dry O
, O
frizzy O
, O
Hermione O
Granger O
- O
esqe O
hair O
so O
I O
needed O
something O
that O
would O
n't O
feel O
like O
I O
'm O
frying O
it O
. O
I O
highly O
, O
highly O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone O
. O
It O
comes O
with O
a O
diffuser O
which O
I O
only O
used O
like O
once O
or O
twice O
but O
it O
's O
ok O
. O
I O
'm O
gon O
na O
have O
this O
one O
for O
awhile O
, O
I O
love O
the O
sleek O
design O
too O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
see O
it O
becoming O
outdated O
like O
those O
pink O
and O
green O
hair O
dryers O
from O
the O
70s O
or O
something O
. O
Thanks O
scientists O
at O
Conair O
, O
I O
salute O
you O
. O

Very O
nice O
hair O
dryer O
. O
My O
favorite O
thing O
is O
that O
you O
push O
down O
the O
on O
/ O
off O
button O
and O
heat O
controls O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
SLIDE O
it O
as O
with O
my O
last O
dryer O
. O
Important O
when O
you O
are O
drying O
hair O
  O
for O
several O
children O
and O
may O
have O
lotion O
on O
your O
hands O
etc O
.... O
works O
well O
, O
looks O
good O
, O
nice O
controls O
. O
I O
am O
happy O
with O
it O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
works O
any O
differently O
than O
my O
last O
Ionic O
hair O
dryer O
, O
in O
terms O
of O
controlling O
frizz O
on O
my O
naturally O
curly O
hair O
, O
but O
it O
works O
equally O
well O
at O
a O
minimum O
. O

Best O
hair O
dryer O
I O
have O
ever O
purchased O
! O
  O
I O
have O
always O
bought O
the O
high O
end O
expensive O
hair O
dryers O
, O
but O
this O
one O
far O
exceeds O
any O
dryer O
I O
have O
bought O
! O
  O
Not O
too O
hot O
, O
light O
weight O
and O
my O
hair O
is O
dryer O
in O
5 O
minutes O
less O
than O
my O
last O
hair O
dryer O
! O
  O
I O
'm O
very O
happy O
with O
my O
purchase O
! O

Best O
wall O
mounted O
hair O
dryer O
I O
have O
owned O
. O
  O
Love O
it O
! O

Because O
of O
the O
placement O
on O
the O
blower O
, O
it O
takes O
up O
more O
space O
than O
I O
anticipated O
. O
  O
It O
does O
the O
job O
! O

I O
love O
this O
hairdryer O
. O
Purchased O
it O
for O
a O
trip O
abroad O
but O
my O
gym O
dryer O
died O
last O
week O
so O
started O
using O
this O
one O
and O
even O
though O
it O
is O
more O
compact O
, O
it O
dries O
my O
hair O
quickly O
. O
The O
dual O
voltage O
is O
a O
plus O
. O
Very O
pleased O
with O
the O
purchase O
. O

Purchased O
this O
without O
much O
research O
, O
so O
I O
am O
to O
blame O
for O
not O
loving O
this O
. O
  O
It O
's O
heavy O
, O
loud O
and O
I O
prefer O
more O
ranges O
in O
heat O
than O
it O
offers O
. O
  O
The O
attachments O
work O
well O
. O
  O
It O
's O
mid O
- O
sized O
, O
so O
if O
you O
're O
wanting O
something O
light O
and O
small O
, O
this O
is O
n't O
it O
. O
  O
Mid O
- O
sized O
and O
heavy O
...... O
I O
would O
not O
buy O
again O
. O

My O
old O
Revlon O
dryer O
died O
when O
my O
hair O
was O
half O
dry O
, O
so O
I O
quickly O
drove O
to O
the O
store O
and O
spent O
three O
minutes O
picking O
out O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
I O
could O
n't O
be O
happier O
. O
My O
hair O
is O
extremely O
thick O
with O
many O
layers O
and O
takes O
a O
long O
time O
to O
dry O
. O
The O
turbo O
setting O
allowed O
me O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
in O
almost O
half O
the O
time O
. O
Even O
better O
, O
the O
hair O
's O
texture O
was O
perfect O
. O
Shiny O
and O
alive O
, O
not O
the O
texture O
of O
straw O
you O
get O
when O
the O
hair O
is O
over O
dried O
. O

Great O
mini O
dryer O
with O
plenty O
of O
power O
. O
Only O
problem O
is O
that O
it O
's O
loud O
on O
high O
setting O
. O

Bought O
this O
hairdryer O
about O
a O
year O
ago O
. O
When O
I O
was O
using O
it O
the O
other O
morning O
, O
it O
went O
on O
and O
off O
and O
went O
on O
fire O
. O
Needless O
to O
say O
, O
I O
am O
not O
recommending O
it O
. O
  O
Never O
had O
this O
happen O
with O
any O
hairdryer O
I O
've O
owned O
. O
  O
No O
stars O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
be O
an O
option O
, O
so O
it O
gets O
one O
by O
default O
. O

better O
price O
than O
walmart O
. O
ca O
n't O
live O
without O
it O
! O

Fits O

The O
barrel O
of O
the O
dryer O
is O
slightly O
less O
than O
2 O
inches O
in O
diameter O
. O
Push O
in O
and O
twist O
, O
it O
will O
latch O
and O
stays O
on O
perfectly O
. O
This O
is O
a O
great O
value O
and O
works O
well O
. O

It O
is O
the O
2nd O
one O
I O
have O
purchased O
. O
Love O
it O
! O

I O
bought O
this O
hair O
dryer O
probably O
3 O
years O
ago O
and O
never O
got O
around O
to O
posting O
a O
review O
. O
This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
fantastic- O
I O
have O
had O
it O
for O
3 O
years O
or O
so O
and O
I O
have O
never O
had O
a O
problem O
or O
malfunction O
. O
It O
drys O
my O
hair O
fast O
and O
reduces O
frizz O
. O
I O
will O
always O
buy O
Elchim O
. O

I O
thought O
the O
button O
issue O
that O
everyone O
else O
wrote O
about O
would O
escape O
me O
. O
Nope O
. O
Almost O
every O
time O
I O
dry O
my O
hair O
I O
hit O
the O
temp O
or O
speed O
button O
... O
at O
least O
2 O
- O
3 O
times O
. O
It O
's O
does O
a O
great O
job O
drying O
but O
the O
buttons O
cause O
just O
enough O
nuance O
that O
I O
would O
recommend O
to O
keep O
looking O
. O
I O
like O
it O
but O
ca O
n't O
wait O
for O
it O
to O
break O
and O
find O
a O
new O
hair O
dryer O
. O

love O
it O
. O

Used O
item O
, O
hair O
in O
back O
of O
blower O
, O
I O
paid O
for O
new O
item O
, O
very O
disappointed O

great O
dryer O
( O
enough O
power O
) O
that O
i O
use O
not O
just O
for O
travel O
. O
  O
only O
problem O
is O
the O
cord O
is O
very O
short O
so O
you O
have O
to O
be O
fairly O
close O
to O
the O
outlet O
when O
you O
use O
it O
. O
  O
if O
they O
would O
make O
the O
cord O
longer O
, O
it O
would O
be O
perfect O
. O
  O
i O
also O
used O
it O
when O
i O
was O
in O
italy O
with O
no O
problems O
( O
although O
you O
do O
need O
an O
adapter O
but O
the O
converter O
is O
built O
in O
) O
. O

It O
took O
me O
waaay O
too O
long O
to O
find O
a O
hair O
dryer O
that O
I O
did O
n't O
think O
was O
going O
to O
start O
a O
fire O
or O
ruin O
my O
hair O
. O
I O
decided O
on O
this O
despite O
some O
bad O
reviews O
, O
and O
am O
glad O
that O
I O
did O
. O
It O
's O
pretty O
( O
I O
know O
this O
is O
n't O
important O
to O
some O
people O
) O
, O
and O
it O
dries O
really O
well O
. O
I O
have O
n't O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
it O
and O
love O
the O
accessories O
that O
came O
with O
it O
. O

I O
have O
short O
curly O
hair O
that O
is O
both O
course O
& O
thick O
. O
Was O
hoping O
this O
could O
replace O
my O
hair O
dryer O
& O
diffuser O
combo O
and O
assumed O
it O
would O
be O
more O
compact O
. O
Unfortunately O
, O
this O
is O
almost O
just O
as O
bulky O
and O
does O
n't O
distribute O
enough O
heat O
to O
curl O
/ O
scrunch O
my O
hair O
WHILE O
simultaneously O
drying O
. O
I O
would O
've O
been O
better O
off O
letting O
my O
hair O
air O
- O
dry O
, O
which O
is O
a O
horrible O
look O
for O
me O
. O
In O
the O
process O
of O
sending O
this O
back O
. O

Blows O
air O
way O
too O
hot O
. O
  O
It O
actually O
burned O
my O
hair O
. O
  O
I O
previously O
had O
another O
blow O
dryer O
the O
same O
brand O
and O
was O
perfect O
. O
  O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
if O
it O
's O
this O
one O
that O
's O
defective O
of O
they O
just O
do O
n't O
make O
them O
like O
before O
. O

I O
heat O
style O
pretty O
frequently O
and O
unfortunately O
burn O
out O
a O
lot O
of O
hair O
dryers O
. O
I O
have O
n't O
invested O
in O
a O
more O
expensive O
one O
and O
I O
may O
not O
need O
to O
. O
This O
baby O
is O
enduring O
through O
my O
blowouts O
! O
The O
ion O
technology O
is O
fantastic O
- O
it O
leaves O
my O
hair O
soft O
and O
smooth O
! O
With O
regular O
cleaning O
this O
has O
lasted O
longer O
than O
any O
other O
one O
I O
owned O
and O
really O
is O
keeping O
my O
hair O
in O
good O
shape O
. O
It O
's O
a O
great O
supplemental O
dryer O
as O
well O
and O
the O
coating O
is O
easy O
to O
grip O
along O
with O
a O
nice O
, O
light O
weight O
. O

6 O
months O
later O
and O
the O
motor O
is O
lagging O
. O
i O
keep O
the O
vent O
cleaned O
to O
no O
avail O
. O
It O
's O
also O
not O
that O
quiet O
. O
Revlon O
makes O
a O
much O
quieter O
one O
. O
Really O
disappointed O
. O

Great O
dryer O
. O
  O
Lightweight O
and O
easy O
to O
handle O
. O
  O
Great O
heat O
and O
cool O
features O
. O

It O
is O
lightweight O
as O
promised O
. O
  O
The O
handle O
folds O
up O
easily O
. O

I O
actually O
like O
this O
blow O
dryer O
very O
much O
. O
It O
makes O
my O
hair O
very O
smooth O
and O
silky O
. O
And O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
settings O
or O
placement O
of O
the O
switches O
, O
as O
others O
have O
stated O
. O
I O
would O
recommend O
this O
blow O
dryer O
to O
anyone O
. O

A O
great O
addition O
to O
my O
hair O

7 O

the O
extra O
part O
for O

go O
where O
you O
want O
it O
. O

Wonderful O
product O

  O
Thank O
you O

It O
smoothes O
the O
fizzies O
and O
folds O
down O
compactly O
to O
store O
when O
done O
. O
  O
It O
has O
three O
speeds O
instead O
of O
two O
, O
so O
does O
n't O
blow O
too O
furiously O
at O
lowest O
setting O
, O
which O
makes O
it O
easier O
to O
style O
my O
hair O
( O
does O
n't O
blow O
it O
off O
of O
the O

what O

the O

but O
it O
fits O
in O
my O
small O
bathroom O

Gets O

Not O
a O
lot O
of O
power O
. O
It O
takes O
a O
lot O
longer O
to O
dry O
long O
hair O
than O
with O
other O
dryers O
. O
The O
brush O
attachment O
is O
also O
a O

  O
For O

  O

Have O

the O

there O
was O
a O
burning O
smell O
coming O

  O
Would O
not O
recommend O
using O

purpose O
. O
  O
Good O

This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
worth O
every O
penny O
! O
I O
read O
an O
article O
by O
a O
top O
hair O
stylist O
who O
recommended O
this O
dryer O
. O
  O
So O
when O
my O
over O
$ O
100 O
infrared O
hair O
dryer O
broke O
after O
one O
year O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
give O
this O
one O
a O
try O
. O
I O
'm O
so O
glad O
I O
did O
because O
not O
only O
is O
it O
light O
weight O
, O
it O
cut O
my O
drying O
time O
down O
, O
and O
it O
helped O
smooth O
out O
my O
hair O
. O
I O
never O
knew O
a O
dryer O
could O
do O
that O
, O
especially O
when O
all O
my O
other O
dryers O
would O
leave O
my O
natural O
curly O
hair O
looking O
frizzy O
. O

It O
was O
damaged O
in O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
, O
poor O
quality O

Does O
what O
it O
is O
supposed O
to O
do O
. O
Could O
maybe O
blow O
air O
a O
little O
stronger O
but O
otherwise O
, O
a O
perfectly O
good O
hair O
dryer O
. O
Comes O
with O
a O
diffuser O
and O
a O
concentrator O
( O
that O
I O
will O
never O
use O
... O
) O

LIGHT O
WEIGHT O
AND O
JUST O
THE O
RIGHT O
AMOUNT O
OF O
HEAT O

This O
small O
Conair O
1875 O
will O
always O
be O
my O
favorite O
hair O
dryer O
. O
It O
is O
compact O
and O
easy O
to O
handle O
. O
I O
hope O
they O
never O
quit O
making O
this O
model O
. O

works O
great O

It O
is O
lightweight O
& O
has O
3 O

  O
I O

This O
hair O
dryer O
performs O
exactly O
as O
expected O
and O
advertised O
. O
  O
I O
recommend O
it O
. O

To O
much O
noise O
but O
does O
the O
work O
. O

Perfect O

When O
it O
works O
right O
it O
is O
my O
dream O
blowdryer O
. O
  O
Yes O
, O
thecontrols O
can O
easily O
get O
flipped O
around O
, O
but O
the O
temp O
andair O
flow O
is O
ideal O
for O
those O
of O
us O
with O
super O
fine O
  O
and O
fragilecurly O
hair O
. O
  O
Whatever O
they O
are O
doing O
to O
these O
ion O
hairdryersis O
nothing O
desirable O
for O
me O
. O
  O
They O
always O
frizz O
me O
out O
. O
  O
I O
use O
the O
high O
heat O
high O
speed O
setting O
with O
the O
hot O
airpik O
to O
straighten O

or O
use O
round O
brushesand O
vary O
the O
heat O
along O
each O
section O
of O
hair O
. O
  O
No O

Rewind O
about O
2003 O
- O
2004 O
: O
Bought O
this O
model O
in O
a O
store O
, O
loved O
it O
, O
and O
used O
it O
til O
it O
died O
in O
about O
2007 O
. O
Boughtanother O
from O
a O
different O
store O
. O
  O
Everything O
was O
fine O
at O
first O
. O
Then O
when O
I O
would O
use O
it O
the O
breaker O
would O
trip O
. O
  O
At O
firstit O
only O
happened O
once O
or O
twice O
, O
which O
is O
just O
one O
of O
thosethings O
that O
can O
happen O
for O
no O
good O
reason O
. O
  O
I O
bought O
anotherafter O
the O
electrician O
ok'd O
everything O
. O
  O
I O
figured O
it O
was O
just O
abad O
dryer O
. O
  O
So O
I O
bought O
one O
more O
from O
a O
different O
store O
. O
Worked O
fine O
until O
it O
sparked O
and O
a O
flame O
came O
out O
the O
end O
. O
After O
a O
burned O
hand O
I O
decided O
I O
should O
try O
and O
find O
anotherdryer O
. O
  O
Around O
2012 O
I O
was O
talking O
to O
a O
friend O
who O
works O
inthe O
salon O
industry O
and O
she O
told O
me O
the O
company O
that O
mademy O
favorite O
dryer O
had O
changed O
the O
way O
they O
made O
them O
. O
That O
made O
me O
think O
it O
was O
worth O
one O
last O
shot O
. O
  O
I O
have O
movedfrom O
where O
I O
used O
all O
my O
other O
dryers O
. O
  O
First O
couple O
dries O
wentgreat O
. O
  O
However O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
trust O
it O
not O
to O
use O
it O
in O
a O
non O
GFCIoutlet O
. O
  O
Last O
couple O
times O
I O
used O
it O
the O
GFCI O
activated O
andturned O
it O
off O
. O
  O
Now O
I O
'm O
convinced O
it O
is O
a O
safety O
hazard O
, O
orat O
the O
very O
least O
a O
challenge O
the O
electrical O
system O
doesn'tneed O
. O
  O
I O
'm O
heartbroken O
over O
that O
. O
  O
If O
the O
manufacturer O
couldaddress O
that O
problem O
, O
I O
would O
be O
SO O
happy O
. O
The O
seller O
on O
Amazon O
was O
reasonably O
priced O
and O
got O
myitem O
to O
me O
quickly O
and O
ingood O
condition O
. O

night O
light O
too O
bright O

Very O
happy O
with O
this O
hair O
dryer O

Does O
the O
trick O

very O
good O
great O
heat O
control O

I O
usually O
cut O
corners O
with O
this O
stuff O
. O
This O
is O
still O
a O
cheap O
dryer O
, O
but O
it O
's O
very O
good O
quality O
. O
The O
matte O
look O
is O
nice O
, O
has O
three O
settings O
for O
heat O
and O
three O
settings O
for O
how O
much O
air O
is O
pushed O
. O
Plus O
the O
cool O
button O
! O
It O
's O
worked O
great O
for O
half O
a O
year O
now O
. O
If O
it O
broke O
I O
'd O
buy O
another O
one O
! O

For O
an O
inexpensive O
hair O
dryer O
, O
this O
thing O
was O
pretty O
amazing O
. O
Lasted O
almost O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
with O
regular O
use O
. O

Love O
the O
light O
weight O
and O
ease O
to O
hold O
. O
  O
Big O
dryers O
are O
too O
heavy O
for O
me O
. O
  O
Good O
strong O
blow O
power O
and O
fast O
drying O

This O
hair O
dryer O
will O
suck O
your O
hair O
into O
the O
air O
intake O
. O

Awesomeness O

love O
love O
love O
good O
for O
my O
hair O

good O

Was O
not O
very O
powerful O
, O
was O
expecting O
a O
little O
more O
from O
it O
. O

Works O
well O
for O
my O
application O
. O

Works O
as O
expected O
fast O
delivery O

I O
have O
always O
bought O
Conair O
products O
in O
the O
past O
, O
so O
I O
never O
expected O
this O
purchase O
to O
be O
problematic O
. O
  O
The O
dryer O
works O
fine O
, O
but O
none O
of O
the O
attachments O
fit O
tightly O
and O
they O
fall O
off O
with O
the O
slightest O
touch O
. O
  O
It O
's O
a O
huge O
design O
error O
and O
frustrating O
as O
can O
be O
. O
  O
I O
would O
never O
recommend O
this O
product O
. O

Certainly O
outperforms O
my O
current O
blow O
dryers O
. O
The O
immediate O
difference O
is O
the O
drying O
time O
. O
I O
would O
n't O
say O
it O
halves O
the O
time O
it O
takes O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
, O
but O
it O
makes O
a O
noticeable O
difference O
. O
It O
's O
also O
relatively O
quieter O
than O
my O
other O
blow O
dryers O
, O
though O
as O
soon O
as O
you O
use O
the O
turbo O
, O
it O
gets O
louder O
. O
I O
certainly O
would O
n't O
call O
it O
a O
quiet O
blow O
dryer O
, O
but O
it O
is O
more O
comfortable O
to O
use O
. O
One O
odd O
thing O
, O
though O
: O
it O
seems O
to O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
suction O
( O
it O
's O
the O
only O
one O
that O
sticks O
to O
my O
shirt O
if O
I O
get O
it O
too O
close O
) O
, O
but O
not O
a O
very O
strong O
air O
flow O
output O
for O
the O
amount O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
drawing O
in.4 O
- O
stars O
so O
far O
because O
it O
's O
about O
its O
price O
; O
outperforms O
my O
current O
blow O
dryers O
but O
not O
by O
a O
significant O
margin O
. O
I O
've O
also O
read O
numerous O
reviews O
that O
this O
does O
n't O
have O
a O
great O
product O
life O
, O
so O
I O
'm O
waiting O
to O
see O
about O
that O
. O

great O
item O

We O
love O
this O
unit O
- O
nite O
light O
too O
! O

Great O
product O
. O
  O
Worked O
awesome O
in O
London O
and O
Scotland O
while O
using O
a O
Universal O
All O
in O
one O
interantional O
travel O
power O
plug O
adapter O
. O

The O
best O
dryer O
ever O
.... O

I O
love O
this O
dryer O
. O
It O
works O
great O
and O
it O
is O
quiet O

I O
bought O
my O
first O
one O
four O
months O
ago O
and O
returned O
it O
because O
it O
was O
shooting O
sparks O
after O
two O
months O
. O
  O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
an O
anomaly O
and O
bought O
a O
second O
one O
like O
a O
ding O
dong O
when O
first O
one O
was O
shot O
and O
it O
caught O
on O

  O
yesterday O
... O
F O
I O
R O
E O
... O
really O
, O
Revlon O
? O

I O
love O
this O
blow O
dryer O
, O
I O
love O
that O
there O
is O
a O
medium O
setting O
! O
! O

I O
love O
this O
small O
and O
easy O
to O
carry O
hair O
dryer O
, O
ideal O
for O
traveling O
. O
I O
will O
use O
Amazon O
for O
all O
my O
shopping O
in O
the O
future O
because O
they O
provide O
excellent O
service O
. O

Already O
had O
one O
. O
Bought O
this O
2nd O
one O
for O
the O
other O
bathroom O
. O
Great O
product O
. O

Purchased O
to O
replace O
an O
older O
Conair O
1875 O
. O
  O
The O
GFCI O
plug O
on O
this O
unit O
failed O
after O
45 O
days O
of O
normal O
use O
. O
In O
the O
future O
I O
will O
look O
for O
a O
dryer O
with O
a O
UL O
safety O
listing O
. O
Too O
bad O
Conair O
is O
diluting O
their O
brand O
with O
this O
junk O
. O

Recently O
purchased O
this O
again O
to O
replace O
a O
unit O
in O
our O
bathroom O
that O
has O
been O
there O
at O
least O
6 O
years O
. O
And O
... O
that O
unit O
still O
runs O
but O
the O
thermocouple O
switch O
that O
shuts O
the O
unit O
off O
when O
it O
overheats O
has O
worn O
over O
the O
years O
and O
has O
begun O
to O
engage O
a O
little O
too O
quickly O
. O
( O
Note O
that O
not O
keeping O
the O
lint O
filter O
clean O
will O
cause O
this O
issue O
as O
well O
, O
due O
to O
restricted O
airflow O
over O
the O
thermocouple).Indeed O
, O
a O
pretty O
darn O
good O
unit O
for O
the O
money O
. O
After O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
of O
use O
( O
literally O
, O
used O
hundreds O
of O
times O
in O
that O
period O
) O
the O
ears O
or O
fingers O
that O
hold O
the O
dryer O
became O
worn O
, O
or O
loose O
, O
so O
the O
hairdryer O
would O
fall O
out O
. O
This O
was O
solved O
by O
placing O
a O
strip O
of O
Velcro O
on O
the O
inside O
of O
each O
ear O
. O
  O
Would O
have O
given O
product O
5 O
stars O
if O
this O
had O
not O
occurred O
. O
Found O
that O
this O
easy O
repair O
needs O
to O
be O
repeated O
every O
couple O
of O
years O
. O
From O
my O
experience O
, O
definitely O
would O
not O
hesitate O
to O
recommend O
. O
Conjecture O
is O
that O
those O
who O
experienced O
short O
life O
with O
this O
appliance O
may O
not O
have O
cleaned O
the O
lint O
filter O
as O
often O
as O
required O
. O
From O
personal O
experience O
I O
know O
it O
's O
easy O
to O
put O
this O
little O
chore O
off O
. O
If O
you O
have O
had O
this O
product O
only O
a O
few O
months O
and O
you O
start O
experiencing O
the O
unit O
shutting O
off O
before O
your O
hair O
is O
dry O
- O
this O
is O
the O
thing O
to O
check O
. O

Love O
it O
! O
The O
power O
, O
the O
light O
weight O
, O
the O
settings O
& O
especially O
easy O
to O
pack O
because O
it O
folds O
up O
! O
I O
have O
fibromyalgia O
and O
my O
hands O
sometimes O
will O
not O
let O
me O
hold O
things O
. O
The O
grip O
on O
this O
is O
easy O
& O
it O
's O
light O
weight O
so O
it O
does O
n't O
hurt O
to O
hold O
it O
when O
drying O
my O
hair O
. O

I O
picked O
this O
up O
on O
lightening O
deal O
as O
I O
needed O
a O
new O
blow O
dryer O
. O
It O
's O
as O
good O
as O
my O
last O
conair O
but O
a O
bit O
less O
powerful O
- O
which O
is O
fine O
for O
me O
because O
I O
could O
n't O
use O
the O
highest O
setting O
on O
my O
last O
one O
since O
it O
blew O
my O
hair O
to O
much O
- O
I O
have O
fine O
hair O
so O
it O
just O
tangled O
my O
hair O
on O
the O
highest O
setting O
. O
I O
love O
the O
retractable O
cord O
! O

It O
's O
so O
nice O
! O

Excellent O
hair O
dryer O
! O
! O
! O
! O

Less O
than O
two O
years O
of O
use O
and O
this O
thing O
just O
stopped O
working O
. O
Aggravating O
! O

Been O
using O
this O
twice O
daily O
for O
over O
a O
year O
. O
Simple O
, O
effective O
. O
You O
do O
n't O
really O
need O
anything O
more O
than O
this O
to O
make O
wet O
hair O
dry O
. O
My O
dog O
would O
probably O
give O
it O
a O
1 O
star O
review O
, O
but O
he O
is O
biased O
because O
he O
hates O
hair O
dryers O
in O
general O
. O

Works O
very O
well O
on O
my O
hair O
. O
One O
thing O
that O
stinks O
, O
though O
, O
is O
that O
the O
concentrator O
piece O
on O
the O
end O
of O
the O
hairdryer O
comes O
off O
every O
now O
and O
then O
and O
it O
can O
become O
very O
annoying O
. O

Very O
loud O
and O
sounds O
like O
an O
afterburner O
out O
of O
an O
F-16 O
. O
Blows O
hot O
and O
cold O
. O

Do O
not O
buy O
this O
dryer O
! O
  O
After O
using O
it O
for O
less O
than O
one O
week O
, O
the O
handle O
would O
become O
so O
incredibly O
hot O
I O
could O
barely O
hold O
on O
to O
it O
. O
  O
I O
noticed O
that O
the O
protective O
covering O
had O
started O
to O
dimple O
and O
come O
apart O
. O
I O
continued O
using O
it O
being O
very O
careful O
where O
I O
put O
my O
hand O
on O
the O
handle O
. O
Now O
, O
after O
less O
than O
one O
month O
, O
it O
quit O
working O
all O
together O
. O
It O
shut O
off O
after O
smelling O
very O
hot O
and O
will O
not O
turn O
back O
on O
. O
  O
Junk O
! O

Had O
this O
product O
for O
several O
years O
and O
wore O
it O
out O
. O
Sure O
glad O
it O
was O
still O
available O
. O
Does O
the O
job O
better O
than O
most O
. O

Excellent O
dryer O
! O
  O
I O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone O

This O
is O
a O
very O
well O
built O
little O
dryer O
and O
works O
well O
. O

It O
's O
a O
tad O
heavier O
than O
I O
would O
like O
but O
I O
love O
the O
retractable O
cord O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
folds O
and O
fits O
easily O
in O
my O
vanity O
drawer O
. O
It O
does O
a O
great O
job O
. O

Excellent O
. O
Great O
Value O
. O
I O
love O
to O
retractable O
cord- O
folding O
aspects O
of O
this O
dryer O
. O
I O
put O
I O
'd O
away O
neatly O
in O
a O
drawer O
/ O
out O
of O
sight O
. O

Great O
price O
for O
an O
adequate O
hair O
dryer O
. O

Great O
diffuser O

Used O
this O
hair O
dryer O
in O
England O
last O
month O
. O
It O
worked O
fine O
with O
the O
adapter O
. O
My O
problem O
with O
this O
hair O
dryer O
is O
that O
even O
on O
the O
low O
setting O
the O
air O
from O
the O
dryer O
is O
too O
hot O
. O
I O
dry O
my O
hair O
in O
sections O
and O
I O
could O
hardly O
get O
a O
section O
dry O
before O
my O
scalp O
would O
start O
to O
burn O
. O

This O
blowdryer O
works O
well O
although O
not O
as O
powerful O
as O
the O
Revlon O
one O
I O
am O
replacing O
this O
with O
. O
  O
It O
dries O
my O
hair O
in O
a O
fair O
amount O
of O
time O
but O
I O
miss O
being O
able O
to O
hold O
onto O
the O
hairdryer O
and O
being O
able O
to O
turn O
it O
on O
and O
off O
one O
handed O
. O
  O
The O
curved O
handle O
on O
this O
does O
not O
allow O
you O
to O
do O
this O
. O
  O
Other O
than O
that O
I O
like O
it O
and O
I O
like O
the O
retractable O
cord O
although O
the O
cord O
could O
be O
a O
tad O
longer O
. O

Awesome O

Bought O
for O
my O
Mother O
, O
and O
it O
does O
what O
it O
is O
supposed O
to O
do O
. O

good O
hair O
dryer O
! O
  O
10mins O
to O
dry O
my O
long O
hair O
! O
I O
am O
so O
happy O

Purchased O
the O
Onei O
MK O
- O
II O
to O
replace O
my O
wigo O
. O
After O
purchasing O
a O
Chi O
& O
Sedu O
I O
was O
hesitant O
to O
purchase O
the O
Onei O
. O
This O
by O
far O
has O
surpassed O
my O
expectations O
& O
my O
experience O
with O
the O
Chi O
& O
Sedu O
. O
I O
need O
a O
hairdryer O
to O
meet O
my O
needs O
: O
dry O
without O
loss O
of O
volume O
& O
decrease O
amount O
/ O
use O
of O
root O
/ O
shine O
styling O
products O
. O
Very O
surprised O
at O
how O
gentle O
the O
air O
flow O
comes O
out O
& O
how O
fast O
my O
hair O
dries O
. O
  O
I O
assume O
it O
's O
based O
on O
the O
barrel O
shape O
of O
the O
Onei O
dryer O
vs O
a O
more O
cylindrical O
barrel O
like O
some O
dryers O
. O
The O
packaging O
of O
the O
dryer O
far O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
. O
The O
quality O
of O
the O
Onei O
feels O
/ O
looks O
better O
than O
the O
sedu O
I O
purchased O
months O
ago O
. O
So O
far O
very O
surprised O
& O
looking O
to O
see O
if O
this O
will O
outlast O
my O
last O
dryer O
a O
wigo(5yrs O
) O
. O
  O
I O
have O
had O
this O
dryer O
for O
only O
a O
month O
& O
have O
not O
heard O
of O
this O
brand O
before O
. O
That O
's O
why O
I O
only O
gave O
it O
a O
4 O
. O
So O
far O
loving O
it O
better O
than O
the O
Sedu O
& O
Chi O
. O

Ionizes O
and O
retracts O
. O
It O
has O
great O
power O
. O

OMG O
, O
I O
have O
been O
looking O
for O
this O
dryer O
for O
at O
least O
5 O
years O
! O
  O
After O
my O
favorite O
dryer O
broke O
, O
I O
looked O
for O
one O
like O
it O
that O
is O
lightweight O
, O
has O
power O
but O
not O
too O
much O
power O
, O
and O
most O
importantly O
, O
has O
the O
high O
/ O
low O
/ O
off O
switch O
on O
the O
BACK O
of O
the O
dryer O
handle O
, O
not O
in O
the O
front O
. O
  O
All O
of O
the O
dryers O
I O
have O
looked O
at O
in O
the O
past O
have O
the O
switch(es O
) O
on O
the O
front O
of O
the O
handle O
. O
  O
This O
is O
a O
problem O
for O
me O
, O
because O
when O
I O
style O
my O
hair O
with O
a O
dryer O
and O
a O
round O
brush O
, O
I O
have O
to O
constantly O
turn O
the O
dryer O
on O
and O
off O
. O
  O
With O
the O
buttons O
on O
the O
back O
of O
the O
handle O
like O
this O
one O
, O
I O
can O
turn O
it O
on O
and O
off O
with O
one O
hand O
. O
  O
When O
the O
buttons O
are O
on O
the O
front O
of O
the O
handle O
, O
I O
have O
to O
set O
my O
brush O
down O
to O
turn O
it O
on O
and O
off O
with O
two O
hands O
. O
  O
What O
a O
hassle O
! O
  O
This O
lightweight O
dryer O
with O
the O
on O
/ O
off O
switch O
on O
the O
back O
of O
the O
handle O
fits O
the O
bill O
perfectly O
. O
  O
I O
will O
probably O
buy O
another O
one O
as O
a O
back O
- O
up O
for O
when O
this O
one O
wears O
out O
. O
  O
I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
dryer O
, O
and O
you O
ca O
n't O
beat O
the O
price O
! O

Good O
! O

These O
little O
dryers O
are O
just O
great O
in O
my O
room O
and O
the O
guest O
room O
. O
Small O
enough O
to O
be O
out O
of O
the O
way O
but O
plenty O
of O
power O
to O
dry O
my O
thick O
hair O
. O
My O
guests O
love O
them O

Great O
service O
. O
I O
just O
wish O
that O
I O
had O
realized O
that O
the O
barrel O
is O
so O
long O
. O
My O
wife O
has O
a O
short O
arm O
  O
and O
has O
difficulty O
using O
the O
dryer O
. O

Bought O
the O
leopard O
version O
of O
this O
blow O
dryer O
because O
of O
the O
cheaper O
price O
and O
I O
LOVE O
it O
. O
It O
is O
a O
great O
blowdryer O
and O
I O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
every O
hair O
stylist O
. O
UPDATE O
: O
now O
7 O
- O
8 O
months O
later O
my O
blowdryer O
is O
broken O
. O
I O
really O
loved O
this O
blowdryer O
but O
mine O
just O
stopped O
work O
and O
only O
blows O
cold O
air O
now O
. O
Very O
disappointing O
. O

I O
like O
the O
warm O
and O
cool O
feature O
! O
Diffuser O
attachment O
an O
added O
bonus O

Replacement O
dryer O
for O
the O
original O
one O
I O
broke O
. O
Love O
it O
. O

It O
works O
OK O
. O
Easy O
to O
use O
. O
Nothing O
special O
about O
it O
. O
  O
It O
says O
for O
salon O
use O
but O
, O
it O
would O
take O
to O
long O
to O
dry O
Salon O
hair O
. O
I O
had O
a O
salon O
use O
blow O
dryer O
and O
it O
dried O
my O
hair O
much O
faster O
but O
the O
price O
was O
around O
$ O
200 O
to O
replace O
it O
. O
  O
so O
, O
for O
the O
price O
of O
the O
MHD O
dryer O
it O
works O
just O
fine O
. O
It O
just O
takes O
longer O
. O

Great O
dryer O
! O
! O
! O
The O
directions O
were O
not O
made O
for O
people O
who O
have O
no O
idea O
what O
they O
are O
doing O
, O
so O
it O
tooke O
about O
a O
month O
or O
so O
to O
actually O
put O
it O
together O
! O
! O
  O
But O
I O
got O
it O
and O
I O
love O
it O
. O
I O
would O
just O
say O
, O
put O
in O
better O
instructions O
to O
follow O
. O

as O
expected O

excellent O

This O
thing O
is O
a O
miracle O
worker O
. O
My O
curls O
have O
never O
look O
bigger O
and O
bouncier O
! O

I O
bought O
this O
hair O
dryer O
because O
it O
's O
dual O
voltage O
and O
I O
needed O
something O
for O
a O
trip O
to O
Italy O
. O
  O
It O
worked O
wonderfully O
in O
Europe O
. O
  O
And O
it O
's O
working O
great O
at O
home O
too O
. O
  O
Nice O
and O
powerful O
. O

very O
happy O
with O
the O
unit O
. O

Works O
very O
well O
. O
You O
only O
have O
to O
be O
careful O
with O
lid O
which O
is O
much O
thinner O
than O
the O
lower O
half O
. O

Fantastic O
product O
.. O
Save O
time O
each O
morning O
with O
this O
amazing O
product O

I O
purchased O
this O
hair O
dryer O
on O
February O
27th O
. O
The O
heating O
element O
stopped O
working O
on O
June O
3rd O
( O
so O
it O
worked O
for O
only O
3 O
months O
. O
) O
It O
will O
blow O
air O
, O
but O
not O
hot O
air O
. O
Returns O
not O
allowed O
after O
30 O
days O
. O

I O
really O
like O
this O
hair O
dryer O
! O
Although O
it O
's O
a O
bit O
heavy O
on O
my O
hands O
as O
I O
'm O
using O
it O
, O
it O
leaves O
my O
hair O
looking O
shiny O
and O
smooth O
with O
minimal O
frizz O
. O
It O
also O
dries O
my O
hair O
efficiently O
and O
quickly O
. O
Highly O
recommend O
it O
and O
it O
's O
at O
a O
great O
price O
! O
! O

This O
sounds O
weird O
, O
but O
the O
night O
light O
is O
MUCH O
TOO O
BRIGHT O
. O
  O
I O
had O
to O
tape O
something O
over O
it O
to O
mute O
the O
light O
. O
  O
The O
mounting O
bracket O
is O
tricky O
to O
install O
and O
kind O
of O
flimsy O
too O

A O
little O
heavy O
on O
the O
hand O
but O
works O
well O
. O

I O
wish O
this O
one O
had O
the O
Ionic O
feature O
that O
my O
other O
one O
has O
, O
which O
seems O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
a O
lot O
faster O
, O
but O
still O
a O
great O
compact O
dryer O
that O
is O
a O
great O
addition O
to O
my O
bathroom O
! O

Was O
tired O
of O
hair O
dryers O
that O

, O
but O
it O
's O
a O
little O
loud O
, O
and O
it O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
get O
as O
hot O
as O
my O
last O
dryer O
. O
  O
It O
takes O
a O
little O
longer O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
, O
but O
at O
the O
price O
I O
paid O
, O
it O
was O
still O
a O
good O
value O
. O
  O
I O
've O
had O
it O
for O
many O
months O
and O
it O
still O
works O
fine O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
little O
dryer O
from O
another O
vendor O
. O
Normally O
it O
takes O
me O
a O
good O
40 O
minutes O
to O
get O
my O
hair O
mostly O
dry O
and O
I O
air O
dry O
the O
rest O
with O
quite O
a O
bit O
of O
frizz O
. O
This O
little O
hair O
dryer O
is O
very O
lightweight O
, O
comfortable O
to O
hold O
and O
dried O
my O
hair O
nearly O
complete O
after O
just O
5 O
minutes O
with O
no O
frizz O
. O
I O
returned O
it O
. O
The O
problem O
is O
, O
this O
is O
literally O
the O
loudest O
hair O
dryer O
I O
have O
ever O
come O
across O
. O
Really O
loud O
. O
I O
felt O
like O
I O
had O
hearing O
issues O
for O
about O
15 O
minutes O
afterward O
. O
Granted O
I O
have O
severe O
migraines O
and O
am O
super O
sensitive O
to O
noise O
. O
I O
love O
the O
job O
it O
did O
, O
I O
just O
wish O
it O
did O
it O
more O
quietly O
. O
I O
could O
not O
imaging O
turning O
this O
on O
while O
traveling O
, O
camping O
, O
staying O
at O
someone O
's O
house O
. O
Too O
bad O

Dries O
as O
it O
should O
with O
aesthetic O
looks O
. O

I O
waited O
6 O
mos O
to O
write O
this O
review O
because O
I O
wanted O
to O
be O
sure O
it O
atleast O
lasted O
that O
long O
. O
This O
thing O
is O
perfect O
for O
home O
use O
. O
I O
use O
it O
on O
myself O
and O
my O
daughter O
. O
roller O
sets O
come O
out O
perfect O
. O
twistouts O
dry O
in O
half O
the O
time O
wash O
and O
go O
's O
have O
less O
shrinkage O
because O
the O
gel O
cast O
sets O
faster O
. O
I O
'm O
so O
glad O
i O
ordered O
this O
product O
. O
It O
is O
top O
heavy O
when O
you O
try O
and O
roll O
it O
I O
support O
the O
bottom O
and O
top O
as O
I O
push O
but O
it O
mainly O
stays O
in O
one O
spot O
. O
The O
bell O
can O
be O
a O
bit O
startling O
but O
mainly O
because O
you O
tune O
out O
the O
sound O
of O
the O
dryer O
so O
when O
the O
timer O
goes O
off O
you O
've O
forgotten O
what O
you O
were O
doing O
. O
i O
do O
nt O
find O
it O
necessary O
to O
crank O
the O
heat O
all O
the O
way O
up O
, O
at O
mid O
range O
my O
hair O
is O
dry O
in O
about O
40min O
. O
In O
Short O
... O
I O
love O
this O
dryer O
and O
if O
anything O
happened O
to O
it O
I O
would O
gladly O
purchase O
again O
. O
I O
ordered O
my O
dryer O
the O
week O
of O
Christmas O
it O
was O
on O
my O
doorstep O
the O
next O
day O

The O
dryer O
blows O
cold O
air O
on O
US O
settings O
! O
Worthless O
unless O
you O
're O
traveling O
abroad O
! O

Works O
perfectly O
. O

Excellent O
product O

Buyer O
beware O
! O
  O
I O
have O
owned O
this O
hair O
dryer O
less O
than O
9 O
months O
. O
  O
While O
drying O
my O
5 O
year O
old O
daughter O
's O
hair O
it O
shut O
off O
. O
  O
We O
thought O
we O
just O
needed O
to O
reset O
it O
on O
the O
plug O
. O
  O
After O
doing O
that O
and O
turning O
it O
back O
on O
we O
heard O
a O
loud O
snap O
. O
  O
It O
burned O
through O
the O
cord O
near O
the O
handle O
and O
left O
black O
marks O
on O
my O
husband O
's O
hand O
. O
  O
Thank O
goodness O
my O
daughter O
was O
n't O
hurt O
. O
  O
What O
a O
dangerous O
piece O
of O
garbage O
. O

Being O
a O
guy O
I O
never O
saw O
a O
need O
for O
a O
hair O
dryer O
, O
but O
recently O
I O
found O
it O
gives O
me O
a O
ton O
of O
volume O
( O
Duh O
) O
. O
This O
is O
a O
great O
buy O
and O
the O
attachment O
works O
wonders O
during O
styling O
. O
Not O
to O
mention O
, O
if O
you O
are O
a O
hairy O
guy O
, O
it O
makes O
the O
drying O
process O
of O
the O
rest O
of O
your O
body O
a O
lot O
easier O
! O

Really O
good O
dryer O
but O
now O
its O
seriously O
overpriced O
. O
Bought O
ours O
on O
Amazon O
in O
March O
for O
only O
$ O
32 O
. O
Totally O
worth O
every O
penny O
, O
however O
totally O
NOT O
worth O
$ O
200 O
. O
Not O
sure O
where O
the O
price O
increase O
came O
from O
..... O

Better O
than O
my O
old O
one O
. O
This O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
faster O
and O
a O
lot O
quieter O
. O

I O
read O
the O
reviews O
on O
this O
hair O
dryer O
and O
decided O
to O
give O
it O
a O
try O
. O
Going O
on O
a O
big O
trip O
and O
definitely O
needed O
a O
small O
travel O
size O
dryer O
. O
This O
hairdryer O
is O
amazing O
for O
its O
size O
. O
  O
I O
have O
fine O
hair O
but O
a O
lot O
of O
it O
and O
this O
thing O
works O
great O
great O
, O
it O
's O
amazing O
for O
its O
size O
how O
much O
power O
it O
has O
. O
I O
have O
a O
very O
expensive O
Ionic O
ceramic O
dryer O
and O
this O
thing O
dries O
my O
hair O
just O
as O
well O
. O
I O
've O
actually O
even O
started O
using O
it O
on O
an O
every O
day O
basis O
and O
for O
the O
price O
you O
can O
not O
go O
wrong O
! O

It O
drys O
my O
hair O
quickly O
and O
is O
n't O
too O
large O
or O
heavy O
to O
use O
. O
I O
wish O
it O
had O
a O
hanging O
loop O
on O
th O
handle O
, O
and O
it O
is O
a O
little O
on O
the O
noisy O
side O

Great O
product O
and O
amazing O
price O
! O
! O
! O

I O
know O
there O
have O
been O
a O
lot O
of O
positive O
reviews O
on O
this O
hairdryer O
but O
the O
one O
that O
I O
purchased O
just O
blew O
up O
. O
  O
Purchased O
in O
February O
of O
2015 O
and O
can O
no O
longer O
use O
it O
in O
the O
end O
of O
May O
2015 O
( O
three O
months O
) O
. O
  O
My O
girlfriend O
and O
myself O
were O
using O
it O
daily O
for O
the O
three O
months O
but O
I O
would O
think O
it O
would O
last O
longer O
than O
that O
. O
  O
Trying O
to O
reach O
out O
to O
the O
manufacturer O
now O
to O
get O
replaced O
but O
this O
is O
a O
hassle O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
deal O
with O
. O
If O
we O
get O
it O
replaced O
, O
I O
'll O
change O
my O
rating O

Everyone O
that O
comes O
over O
comments O
: O
“ O
WHERE O
did O
you O
get O
a O
hotel O
hair O
dryer O
! O
I O
WANT O
ONE O

! O
! O
” O
it O
works O
great O
, O
I O
use O
it O
every O
single O
morning O
and O
also O
with O
some O
craft O
projects O
. O
it O
’s O
easy O
to O
use O
and O
i O
love O
love O
love O
how O
you O
just O
shove O
it O
in O
it O
’s O
holster O
( O
like O
slamming O
an O
old O
telephone O
haha O
) O
very O
satisfying O
because O
it O
turns O
OFF O
when O
you O
put O
it O
in O
its O
home O
. O
Love O
that O
about O
it O
. O
I O
also O
like O
the O
position O
of O
the O
grip O
. O
I O
mounted O
mine O
onto O
tile O
with O
two O
3 O
M O
heavy O
duty O
adhesive O
strips O
so O
we O
did O
n’t O
have O
to O
drill O
holes O
. O
It O
’s O
holding O
up O
well O
and O
when O
it O
is O
time O
to O
take O
it O
off O
, O
you O
just O
slide O
the O
base O
off O
it O
’s O
mount O
and O
work O
with O
it O
directly O
. O
Great O
buy O

Works O
great O
. O
My O
wife O
really O
liked O
it O
for O
Mother O
's O
Day O
. O
Its O
dries O
her O
hair O
faster O
than O
her O
old O
one O
. O

Light O
too O
bright O

This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
light O
, O
quiet O
, O
and O
best O
of O
all O
, O
the O
cord O
swoops O
right O
up O
into O
the O
body O
of O
the O
dryer O
with O
the O
push O
of O
a O
button O
. O
I O
love O
, O
love O
, O
LOVE O
this O
feature O
. O

The O
bonnet O
is O
not O
quite O
big O
enough O
for O
large O
rollers O
, O
so O
the O
heat O
does O
not O
circulate O
well O
. O
  O
I O
'm O
still O
looking O
for O
the O
old O
- O
fashioned O
hat O
box O
dryers O
that O
I O
had O
in O
the O
60 O
's O
. O

Love O
it O
! O
! O
! O
! O
I O
've O
had O
it O
for O
couple O
of O
months O
now O
. O
Definitely O
recommend O
it O
. O

Great O

This O
is O
the O
WORST O
hair O
dryer O
that O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
. O
The O
one O
that O
Andis O
quit O
making O
, O
and O
I O
guess O
replaced O
it O
with O
this O
thing O
, O
was O
SOOOOOOO O
much O
better O
than O
this O
punny O
thing O
. O
Anything O
can O
blow O
harder O
than O
this O
one O
, O
it O
's O
terrible O
. O
The O
nozzle O
( O
I O
guess O
that O
's O
what O
you O
call O
it O
) O
anyway O
where O
the O
air O
comes O
out O
is O
so O
big O
around O
, O
what O
little O
air O
that O
comes O
out O
goes O
everywhere O
and O
you O
ca O
n't O
style O
your O
hair O
with O
it O
. O
Seems O
as O
though O
when O
a O
company O
comes O
up O
with O
a O
good O
product O
and O
it O
sells O
good O
, O
they O
ca O
n't O
stand O
it O
, O
and O
then O
they O
come O
up O
with O
something O
in O
it O
's O
place O
that O
is O
terrible O
and O
they O
think O
people O
should O
except O
their O
stupidity O
for O
making O
such O
a O
mess O
of O
things O
. O
I O
have O
had O
Andis O
wall O
hair O
dryers O
for O
years O
and O
loved O
them O
but O
, O
this O
one O
is O
the O
poorest O
excuse O
for O
a O
hair O
dryer O
that O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
Thank O
You O
, O
Louise O
Bell O

Very O
good O
hair O
dryer O
. O
Mounting O
bracket O
works O
very O
good O
. O

Worked O
great O
until O
it O
broke O
8.5 O
months O
in O
. O

I O
shopped O
around O
for O
a O
blow O
dryer O
and O
was O
about O
to O
buy O
one O
for O
well O
over O
100 O
dollars O
when O
I O
came O
across O
this O
one O
... O
so O
I O
thought O
I O
would O
give O
it O
a O
chance O
. O
  O
I O
am O
happy O
to O
say O
that O
I O
love O
it O
. O
  O
The O
chord O
is O
nice O
and O
long O
, O
the O
buttons O
are O
easy O
to O
set O
and O
do O
not O
sit O
in O
an O
area O
where O
they O
are O
in O
the O
way O
. O
  O
The O
cold O
shot O
button O
must O
be O
held O
down O
but O
it O
shoots O
out O
a O
nice O
cold O
blast O
of O
air O
to O
help O
set O
your O
hair O
. O
  O
The O
hot O
setting O
is O
super O
hot O
but O
I O
am O
sure O
works O
well O
with O
thick O
hair O
. O
  O
I O
mostly O
use O
the O
medium O
heat O
without O
any O
damage O
. O

I O
hairdresser O
recommended O
this O
blow O
dryer O
to O
me O
she O
said O
it O
was O
the O
strongest O
and O
best O
she O
has O
ever O
used O
, O
she O
was O
right O
. O
  O
I O

use O
this O
blow O
dryer O
in O
the O
movie O
Twister O

make O
the O

3 O
. O
  O
Every O
time O
one O
stops O
working O
, O
I O
buy O
another O
one O
. O
  O
It O
makes O
my O
hair O
look O
and O
feel O
great O
. O

Just O
the O
right O
size O
and O
power O
for O
travel O
. O

its O
fine O

Perfect O
! O
Good O
power O
. O

Small O
but O
packs O
some O
serious O
heat O
and O
power O
! O

Heats O
great O
, O
love O
the O
ergonimical O
style O

I O
love O
this O
hair O
dryer O

Works O
great O

I O
work O
for O
a O
salon O
that O
provides O
you O
with O
everything O
but O
your O
shears O
and O
I O
HATED O
the O
blow O
dryer O
they O
provide O
. O
I O
went O
to O
Cosmoprof O
and O
saw O
that O
this O
model O
was O
on O
sale O
and O
I O
decided O
to O
give O
it O
a O
shot O
thinking O
if O
I O
hate O
it O
I O
can O
always O
trade O
it O
in O
and O
get O
something O
else O
and O
since O
this O
was O
one O
of O
the O
more O
expensive O
models O
I O
'd O
get O
a O
small O
refund O
as O
well O
. O
The O
first O
client O
I O
had O
I O
noticed O
a O
huge O
difference O
, O
no O
frizzy O
hair O
and O
it O
does O
the O
job O
in O
half O
of O
the O
time O
than O
my O
other O
blowdryer O
. O
( O
Also O
, O
to O
fellow O
cosmetologists O
, O
I O
recommend O
the O
power O
styler O
from O
Daroko O
to O
use O
with O
your O
blowdryer)This O
is O
definitely O
a O
case O
of O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
. O
This O
blow O
dryer O
is O
worth O
the O
money O
. O
If O
you O
are O
ok O
the O
beauty O
industry O
this O
is O
a O
great O
investment O
. O

LOVE O
this O
hairdryer O
! O
! O
I O
keep O
getting O
compliments O
on O
my O
hair O
lately O
and O
the O
only O
thing O
I O
've O
done O
differently O
is O
to O
start O
using O
this O
blow O
dryer O
( O
with O
no O
cut O
or O
professional O
styling O
in O
months O
) O
! O
The O
small O
diffuser O
was O
a O
tight O
fit O
at O
first O
, O
but O
the O
more O
I O
've O
used O
it O
, O
the O
easier O
it O
's O
gotten O
. O
I O
guess O
the O
little O
tabs O
had O
to O
be O
rubbed O
down O
a O
bit O
. O
Never O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
curling O
diffuser O
. O
2 O
months O
in O
and O
am O
satisfied O
so O
far O
! O

I O
sent O
it O
back O
. O
  O
Basically O
not O
worth O
it O
. O
  O
Heavy O
- O
cord O
did O
not O
retract O
all O
the O
way O
-- O
not O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
. O

Good O
product O

Works O
fine O
but O
at O
their O
higher O
price O
no O
longer O
a O
good O
buy O

This O
hairdryer O
does O
not O
get O
very O
hot O
. O
On O
high O
heat O
it O
blows O
warm O
/ O
cool O
on O
the O
low O
blow O
setting O
. O
Even O
on O
the O
high O
heat O
and O
high O
blow O
setting O
it O
is O
only O
warm O
. O
  O
It O
takes O
longer O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
with O
this O
than O
my O
10 O
year O
old O
Panteen O
hair O
dryer O
. O
No O
reduction O
in O
frizz O
. O
I O
bought O
this O
on O
amazon O
but O
I O
saw O
this O
exact O
hairdryer O
at O
dollar O
general O
for O
$ O
15 O
. O
  O
It O
is O
ok O
. O
I O
would O
n't O
buy O
it O
again O
. O

fit O
my O
old O
wall O
mount O
- O
works O
great O
! O

The O
mounting O
screws O
that O
screw O
the O
base O
to O
the O
mounting O
plate O
are O
really O
tiny O
and O
flimsy O
. O
One O
of O
the O
two O
screws O
stripped O
its O
thread O
right O
away O
when O
it O
was O
being O
slightly O
tighten O
. O
It O
's O
a O
shame O
that O
a O
good O
product O
fails O
for O
something O
so O
simple O
. O

this O
product O
did O
not O
work O
at O
all O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
newand O
fine O
but O
never O
went O
on O

LOVE O
, O
LOVE O
, O
LOVE O
IT O
. O
Very O
strong O
wind O
and O
make O
my O
hair O
dry O
much O
faster O
. O
ca O
n't O
live O
without O
it O
, O

Love O
it O

Hard O
to O
flex O
into O
position O
. O

This O
hair O
dryer O
left O
my O
hair O
a O
tangeled O
mess O
each O
time O
I O
used O
it O
. O
  O
I O
will O
be O
returning O
and O
going O
back O
to O
a O
conair O
or O
revlon O
hair O
dryer O
. O

The O
best O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
In O
fact O
this O
was O
a O
replacement O
for O
the O
one O
I O
had O
for O
ten O
years O

Works O
great O
, O
gave O
me O
my O
independence O
back O
. O

I O
read O
the O
reviews O
and O
decided O
to O
try O
this O
. O
  O
Maybe O
BaByliss O
spoiled O
me O
I O
dunno O
. O
My O
hair O
is O
way O
too O
dry O
and O
does O
nt O
hold O
its O
shape O
. O
Returning O
and O
sticking O
with O
BaByliss O
. O

Love O
this O

Love O
it O
! O
  O
Does O
not O
frizz O
out O
my O
hair O
at O
all O
in O
fact O
it O
smooths O
it O
really O
well O
and O
gives O
me O
that O
just O
went O
to O
the O
salon O
look O
. O

This O
is O
my O
second O
Andis O
wall O
mounted O
hair O
dryer O
, O
which O
replaced O
one O
that O
was O
over O
5 O
years O
old O
. O
  O
Of O
course O
, O
the O
wall O
mount O
feature O
is O
the O
best O
for O
keeping O
a O
clutter O
- O
free O
countertop O
, O
but O
I O
also O
appreciate O
that O
it O
is O
quiet O
and O
has O
the O
power O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
quickly O
. O
  O
( O
I O
have O
thick O
, O
shoulder O
length O
hair O
. O
) O

The O
on O
/ O
off O
and O
heat O
selector O
buttons O
are O
not O
toggle O
or O
rocker O
switch O
like O
other O
ones O
it O
seems O
to O
wobble O
when O
operated O
and O
feel O
it O
might O
not O
last O
as O
long O
as O
others O
. O
  O
I O
do O
not O
use O
often O
but O
others O
in O
family O
will O
. O
  O
Will O
have O
to O
see O
how O
it O
wears O
. O

just O
like O
we O
use O
when O
we O
travel O
( O
Mariott O
uses O
these O
) O

Very O
good O
product O
! O

Good O
hair O

! O

Great O
for O
speed O
drying O
and O
traveling O
. O

Love O

. O

Makes O
me O
hair O
smooth O

dries O
my O

quickly O
. O
Love O
it O
. O

Quietiest O
Hair O
dryer O
that O
we O
've O
ever O
owned O
. O
  O
Very O
powerful O
, O
drys O
quickly O
and O
efficiently O
. O
  O
Love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
! O

Nice O
product O
, O
but O
never O
got O
the O
diffuser O
it O
was O
supposed O
to O
come O
with O
. O

Does O
n't O
fold O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O

I O
absolutely O
love O
this O
dryer O
! O
The O
buttons O
are O
easy O
to O
use O
, O
the O
concentrator O
nozzle O
keeps O
my O
hair O
smooth O
and O
it O
dries O
in O
half O
the O
time O
! O
I O
would O
buy O
this O
again O
! O

Wife O
did O
n't O
really O
like O
it O
. O
Was O
n't O
impressed O
. O
Works O
fine O
though O
. O

Overheats O
REALLY O
easy O
:( O
It O
is O
light O
, O
small O
, O
cute O
and O
works O
ok O
apart O
from O
that O
... O
I O
would O
also O
prefer O
the O
tip O
thinner O

Great O
product O
quiet O
like O
I O
've O
never O
experienced O
I O
forget O
it O
's O
on O
if O
I O
walk O
away O
from O
it O
! O
LolGets O
really O
hot O
so O
be O
careful O
to O
adjust O
or O
sit O
low O
.. O
best O
dryer O
ever O
and O
I O
've O
owned O
7 O

I O
’m O
better O
impressed O
with O
the O
Curlipops O
Diffuser O
Dryer O
than O
I O
was O
with O
my O
deceased O
Conair O
Curl O
Fusion O
Ionic O
Ceramic O
Styler O
Hair O
Dryer O
( O
next O
to O
current O
generation O
) O
which O
the O
Curlipops O
is O
replacing O
for O
me O
. O
Both O
dryers O
have O
negative O
ionic O
technology O
, O
which O
makes O
them O
preferable O
to O
the O
free O
hairdryers O
at O
hotels O
, O
the O
gym O
, O
and O
my O
therapy O
pool O
, O
as O
I O
always O
notice O
much O
more O
frizz O
when O
I O
use O
those O
dryers O
than O
when O
I O
use O
my O
own O
. O
So O
, O
in O
that O
regard O
, O
they O
’re O
both O
preferable O
IMO.Unlike O
the O
Conair O
, O
the O
Curlipops O
allows O
you O
to O
position O
the O
diffuser O
the O
way O
you O
want O
to O
, O
and O
for O
me O
that O
’s O
so O
that O
there O
are O
n’t O
large O
gaps O
between O
the O
dryer O
fan O
and O
your O
hair O
. O
It O
may O
be O
that O
I O
have O
a O
heightened O
sense O
of O
safety O
awareness O
, O
after O
working O
in O
health O
care O
for O
38 O
years O
, O
but O
the O
Conair O
’s O
clipping O
on O
in O
a O
way O
that O
kept O
the O
gaps O
as O
wide O
as O
possible O
did O
n’t O
give O
me O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
confidence O
that O
it O
would O
work O
well O
for O
“ O
pixiecurling O
. O
” O
For O
those O
who O
do O
n’t O
know O
, O
this O
is O
a O
method O
of O
drying O
curly O
hair O
, O
developed O
by O
someone O
who O
goes O
by O
“ O
pixiecurl O
” O
on O
naturallycurly.com O
, O
in O
which O
you O
scrunch O
your O
hair O
into O
the O
bowl O
of O
a O
dryer O
’s O
diffuser O
with O
the O
dryer O
off O
, O
turn O
it O
on O
and O
dry O
that O
section O
of O
hair O
, O
then O
turn O
it O
off O
before O
repositioning O
the O
dryer O
: O
because O
the O
dryer O
is O
n’t O
on O
when O
you O
do O
the O
scrunching O
, O
curls O
stay O
better O
defined O
, O
but O
another O
factor O
is O
that O
your O
hair O
is O
n’t O
being O
pushed O
away O
by O
airflow O
when O
you O
’re O
positioning O
the O
dryer O
, O
only O
possibly O
an O
issue O
with O
a O
pancake O
style O
dryer O
. O
I O
was O
still O
too O
chicken O
to O
try O
it O
with O
pixiecurling O
, O
but O
used O
the O
method O

) O
uses O
in O
her O
hair O
drying O
video O
& O
# O
60 O
; O
and O
it O
worked O
great O
! O
My O
hair O
dried O
a O
lot O
faster O
, O
curled O
really O
well O
, O
and O
I O
had O
no O
problems O
with O
frizz O
as O
it O
finished O
drying O
. O
Although O
it O
’s O
a O
little O
difficult O
to O
attach O
initially O
, O
the O
diffuser O
works O
really O
well O
, O
and O
that O
’s O
no O
biggie O
since O
I O
have O
no O
reason O
to O
keep O
removing O
and O
reattaching O
it O
, O
it O
just O
resides O
on O
the O
dryer O
. O
So O
one O
for O
Curlipops O
. O
It O
has O
three O
heat O
settings O
: O
cool O
, O
warm O
, O
and O
hot O
, O
which O
are O
independent O
of O
the O
airflow O
speed O
, O
as O
well O
as O
having O
a O
cool O
shot O
button O
. O
I O
do O
n’t O
use O
high O
speed O
because O
it O
disorganizes O
my O
curls O
. O
I O
’m O
also O
unlikely O
to O
use O
hot O
, O
but O
it O
’s O
nice O
to O
have O
the O
option O
of O
finishing O
with O
cool O
air O
without O
having O
to O
hold O
the O
cool O
shot O
button O
down O
for O
an O
extended O
period O
of O
time O
. O
The O
Conair O
has O
Hi O
, O
Off O
, O
and O
Lo O
, O
along O
with O
a O
cool O
shot O
button O
, O
so O
airspeed O
and O
heat O
, O
or O
lack O
thereof O
, O
are O
connected O
to O
each O
other O
, O
and O
I O
score O
another O
one O
for O
the O
Curlipops O
. O
Whine O
: O
the O
Conair O
has O
it O
in O
spades O
, O
and O
the O
Curlipops O
has O
very O
little O
. O
So O
I O
give O
this O
one O
to O
the O
Curlipops O
too O
. O
Both O
dryers O
are O
listed O
as O
having O
the O
same O
weight O
, O
according O
to O
Amazon O
, O
though O
that O
’s O
really O
the O
shipping O
weight O
. O
It O
’s O
a O
little O
more O

I O
’d O
like O

considering O
I O
have O
fibromyalgia O

and O
I O
do O
n’t O
need O
any O
help O
making O
my O
arms O
and O
shoulders O
ache O
, O
but O
it O
’s O
still O
better O
than O
getting O
hypothermia O
, O
pneumonia O
, O
or O
bronchitis O
. O
Also O
, O
not O
having O
the O
dryer O
permanently O
attached O
to O
a O
wall O
means O
I O
can O
get O
into O
more O
comfortable O
positions O
while O
drying O
my O
hair O
. O
Both O
still O
weigh O
less O
than O
my O
mother O
’s O
non O
- O
ionic O
, O
folding O

travel O
dryer O

which O
I O
used O
once O
while O
I O
was O
moving O
her O
, O
then O
abandoned O
due O
to O
the O
abundant O
halo O
of O
frizz O
it O
created O
. O
So O
score O
one O
for O
both O
pancake O
dryers O
. O
However O
, O
neither O
one O
has O
dual O
voltage O
, O
and O
the O
Curlipops O

instructions O
specifically O
state O
it O
should O
not O
be O
used O
with O
a O
voltage O
converter O
, O
so O
it O
would O
not O
be O
a O
possible O
choice O
for O
travel O
outside O
of O
North O
America O
. O
Curlipops O
. O
It O
has O
three O
heat O
settings O
: O
cool O
, O
warm O
, O
and O
hot O
, O
which O
are O
independent O
of O
the O
airflow O
speed O
, O
as O
well O
as O
having O
a O
cool O
shot O
button O
. O
I O
do O
n’t O
use O
high O
speed O
because O
it O
disorganizes O
my O
curls O
. O
I O
’m O
also O
unlikely O
to O
use O
hot O
, O
but O
it O
’s O
nice O
to O
have O
the O
option O
of O
finishing O
with O
cool O
air O
without O
having O
to O
hold O
the O
cool O
shot O
button O
down O
for O
an O
extended O
period O
of O
time O
. O
The O
Conair O
has O
Hi O
, O
Off O
, O
and O
Lo O
, O
along O
with O
a O
cool O
shot O
button O
, O
so O
airspeed O
and O
heat O
, O
or O
lack O
thereof O
, O
are O
connected O
to O
each O
other O
, O
and O
I O
score O
another O
one O
for O
the O
Curlipops O
. O
Whine O
: O
the O
Conair O
has O
it O
in O
spades O
, O
and O
the O
Curlipops O
has O
very O
little O
. O
So O
I O
give O
this O
one O
to O
the O
Curlipops O
too O
. O
Both O
dryers O
are O
listed O
as O
having O
the O
same O
weight O
, O
according O
to O
Amazon O

though O
that O
’s O
really O
the O

It O
’s O

Nice O
blower O
. O

This O
dryer O
is O
amazing O
! O
It O
works O
better O
than O
the O
shop O
dryers O
. O
It O
's O
super O
quiet O
besides O
the O
timer O
tick O
but O
even O
the O
tick O
is O
less O
noisy O
than O
the O
shop O
dryer O
.. O
me O
and O
my O
clients O
can O
carry O
on O
a O
conversation O
and O
they O
can O
enjoy O
watching O
t.v O
. O
This O
dryer O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
in O
all O
areas O
and O
it O
was O
also O
very O
easy O
to O
assemble O
. O
The O
shipping O
was O
also O
awesome O
it O
arrived O
within O
3 O
days O
from O
ordering O
it O
. O
I O
recommend O
this O
dryer O
to O
anyone O
. O

I O
have O
thick O
hair O
and O
this O
baby O
gets O
my O
hair O
dry O
quickly O
and O
WITHOUT O
frizzies O
! O
Love O
it O
! O

This O
dryer O
is O
so O
light O
weight O
! O
! O
I O
was O
amazing O
by O
that O
. O
It O
is O
perfect O
for O
what O
I O
needed O
. O

Does O
what O
it O
is O
supposed O
to O
. O
A O
noted O
design O
flaw O
... O
the O
hose O
connector O
to O
the O
bonnet O
does O
not O
couple O
well O
, O
or O
rather O
stay O
connected O
. O
I O
suggest O
that O
you O
shove O
the O
male O
hose O
part O
into O
the O
female O
bonnet O
part O
, O
without O
using O
the O
notches O
. O
It O
may O
permanently O
attach O
the O
tow O
so O
you O
can O
no O
longer O
use O
the O
brush O
or O
detach O
them O
, O
but O
it O
will O
keep O
the O
two O
secure O
. O
  O
Also O
it O
kind O
of O
smells O
weird O
when O
on O
. O

Bought O
dryer O
for O
my O
daughter O
it O
is O
n't O
hot O
enough O
for O
me O
but O
awesome O
for O
my O
10yr O
old O
to O
dry O
her O
thin O
/ O
fine O
hair O
with O

Fits O
a O
need O
, O
but O
not O
as O
nicely O
made O
as O
the O
model O
it O
replaced O
. O
The O
base O
is O
all O
molded O
plastic O
and O
is O
not O
really O
integrated O
with O
the O
hair O
dryer O
. O
What O
I O
mean O
is O
that O
there O
are O
two O
notches O
cut O
in O
to O
the O
plastic O
base O
and O
the O
hair O
dryer O
cord O
is O
run O
through O
the O
notches O
with O
some O
rubber O
grommets O
used O
to O
hold O
the O
cord O
in O
place O
. O
There O
are O
not O
a O
lot O
of O
alternative O
products O
to O
choose O
from O
and O
on O
the O
plus O
side O
it O
was O
relatively O
cheap O
and O
easy O
to O
install O
. O

I O
have O
very O
thick O
and O
coarse O
hair O
and O
this O
is O
the O
best O
hairdryer O
I O
have O
owned O
until O
now O
! O
It O
gets O
my O
hair O
dry O
so O
fast O
, O
and O
the O
end O
results O
are O
smooth O
and O
frizzless O
hair O
. O
With O
other O
hair O
dryers O
it O
takes O
anywhere O
from O
25 O
- O
35 O
minutes O
but O
this O
one O
literally O
takes O
7 O
- O
10 O
minutes O
plus O
adds O
more O
volume O
to O
my O
hair O
. O
The O
heat O
settings O
are O
perfect O
as O
well O
in O
case O
someone O
does O
n't O
want O
to O
add O
too O
much O
heat O
to O
your O
hair O
.. O
Every O
dryer O
I O
have O
ever O
owned O
did O
pretty O
much O
all O
the O
same O
things O
but O
at O
the O
end O
made O
my O
hair O
frizzy O
and O
dried O
my O
hair O
out O
. O
This O
dryer O
is O
THE O
ONLY O
ONE O
that O
makes O
my O
hair O
look O
so O
beautiful O
, O
sleek O
, O
soft O
and O
shiny O
! O
It O
makes O
my O
hair O
so O
smooth O
that O
I O
almost O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
flat O
iron O
it O
since O
it O
is O
naturally O
wavy O
. O
Freakinglyyy O

A++ O

Great O
power O

compact O

, O
easy O
to O
use O
. O
This O
is O
for O
my O
regular O
daily O
use O
because O
the O
small O
size O
fits O
under O
my O
sink O
but O
is O
powerful O
enough O
to O
blow O
out O
my O
hairstyle O
every O
day O
. O

I O
got O
this O
as O

works O
great O
. O
Perfect O
for O
weekend O
trips O
away O
from O
home O
and O
small O
enough O
to O
toss O
in O
a O
bag O
and O
take O
to O
the O
gym O
. O
Not O
terribly O
noisy O
either O
. O
I O
wish O
it O
had O
a O
medium O
heat O
setting O
but O
other O
than O
that O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
complain O

No O

has O
the O
hot O

warm O

  O
Works O
great O
. O

Of O
the O
two O
blow O

Great O
hairdryer O
! O

My O
favorite O
hair O
dryer O
, O
powerful O
, O
totally O
recommended O
! O

A O
lot O
of O
power O
. O
  O
Heavier O
than O
some O
hair O
dryers O
that O
I O
have O
previously O
owned O
. O
  O
Does O
n't O
get O
as O
hot O
as O
I O
would O
like O
it O
to O
, O
but O
still O
styles O
your O
hair O
effectively O
. O

Good O
value O
I O
am O
very O
happy O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
from O
Amazon O
warehouse O
deals O
, O
so O
it O
was O
a O
few O
dollars O
cheaper O
. O
The O
only O
thing O
it O
did O
n't O
have O
was O
a O
box O
. O
Everything O
else O
was O
there O
, O
and O
working O
. O
There O
was O
no O
damage O
to O
the O
item O
itself O
. O
This O
hair O
dryer O
runs O
a O
bit O
quieter O
and O
smoother O
than O
my O
previous O
one O
, O
and O
has O
both O
the O
concentrator O
and O
diffuser O
, O
and O
cold O
shot O
, O
so O
I O
'm O
set O
. O
It O
's O
light O
too O
, O
so O
if O
you O
spend O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
using O
it O
your O
wrist O
and O
hand O
wo O
n't O
get O
as O
tired O
. O
Great O
buy O
for O
the O
price O
. O
Better O
than O
the O
$ O
30 O
one O
I O
bought O
at O
Sally O
Beauty O
. O

So O
this O
blow O
dryer O
has O
a O
purple O
hint O
of O
color O
just O
an O
fyi O
and O
love O
it O
. O
I O
used O
it O
for O
the O
first O
time O
because O
my O
other O
blow O
dryer O
would O
cause O
a O
lot O
of O
split O
ends O
, O
instantly O
. O
So O
I O
used O
it O
for O
the O
first O
time O
and O
no O
split O
ends O
, O
yay O
! O
. O
I O
also O
did O
use O
another O
blow O
out O
product O
with O
this O
blow O
dryer O
which O
you O
should O
try O
to O
prevent O
split O
ends O
. O
I O
use O
the O
RedKen O
Satinwear O
Blow O
dry O
Lotion O
before O
I O
start O
blow O
drying O
and O
both O
combined O
work O
wonders O
. O
Your O
hair O
will O
look O
like O
you O
just O
came O
out O
of O
the O
salon O
. O

This O
is O
actually O
a O
pretty O
darned O
good O
blow O
dryer O
for O
the O
price O

  O
Just O
wish O

was O
longer O

good O
product O

My O
daughter O
has O
coarse O
thick O
hair O
whereas O
my O
son O
has O
thin O
straight O
hair O
. O
This O
dryer O
works O
for O
both O
of O
them O
efficiently O
. O
Works O
FAST O
! O
Do O
n't O
need O
a O
flat O
iron O
for O
my O
daughter O
since O
this O
gets O
it O
pretty O
straight O
while O
drying O
. O
Cuts O
time O
in O
half O

Bought O
based O
on O
good O
reviews O
and O
I O
now O
Highly O
recommend O
it O
myself O
! O
  O
Try O
it O
and O
you O
'll O
never O
want O
a O
different O
hair O
dryer O
. O

I O
love O
the O
amount O
of O
air O
it O
produces O
and O
the O
multiple O
heat O
and O
blow O
settings O
! O

This O
is O
a O
very O
decent O
little O
hair O
dryer O
: O
very O
inexpensive O
, O
two O
speeds O
and O
heats O
, O
but O
it O
packs O
punch O
for O
its O
size O
. O
I O
wish O
it O
were O
some O
other O
color O
( O
not O
a O
huge O
fan O
of O
pink O
) O
, O
but O
I O
am O
very O
satisfied O
with O
this O
purchase O
. O

bigger O
than O
I O
expected O
, O
does O
n't O
fit O
in O
my O
drawer O
. O
  O
but O
the O
product O
itself O
works O
great O
. O

Very O
good O
for O
the O
price O
. O
Gets O
super O
hot O
so O
you O
have O
to O
be O
careful O
. O

Would O
have O
preferred O
a O
stronger O
airflow O

Love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
It O
dries O
my O
hair O
faster O
than O
others O
and O
makes O
my O
hair O
soft O
. O

Exactly O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
! O
Here O
's O
hoping O
it O
lives O
a O
long O
and O
service O
- O
oriented O
life O
. O

Best O
hair O
dryer O
I O
have O
ever O
owned O
! O

Absolute O
bargain O
of O
the O
century O
! O
My O
wife O
had O
two O
Chi O
's O
break O
in O
the O
course O
of O
around O
five O
years O
. O
While O
most O
would O
argue O
that O
2 O
- O
3 O
years O
is O
adequate O
- O
when O
one O
pays O
$ O
100 O
+ O
for O
a O
hairdryer O
, O
you O
expect O
to O
see O
many O
long O
years O
of O
service O
. O
Instead O
of O
sinking O
another O
hundo O
into O
what O
is O
just O
a O
high O
priced O
Chinese O
made O
hair O
dryer O
, O
we O
took O
a O
gamble O
on O
the O
Herstyler O
Pro O
. O
The O
result O
? O
My O
wife O
is O
101 O
% O
pleased O
- O
really O
. O
FIt O
and O
finish O
is O
as O
good O
as O
the O
Chi O
. O
Logical O
button O
placement O
and O
function O
is O
perfect O
. O
Temps O
are O
ideal O
, O
force O
is O
great O
and O
the O
whole O
hairdryer O
feels O
like O
a O
salon O
professional O
. O
They O
could O
double O
the O
price O
and O
it O
would O
still O
be O
a O
steal O
. O
VERY O
well O
done O
. O
I O
like O
it O
so O
much O
, O
we O
are O
buying O
a O
second O
to O
stick O
on O
the O
shelf O
if O
the O
first O
ever O
gives O
up O
the O
ghost O
. O

Much O
smaller O
than O
anticipated O
- O
not O
sure O
what O
they O
measured O
for O
the O
dimensions O
. O
It O
is O
also O
fairly O
weak O
if O
you O
have O
thicker O
hair O
. O

Would O
give O
zero O
stars O
if O
allowed O
. O
The O
day O
it O
arrived O
, O
took O
it O
out O
of O
the O
box O
, O
plugged O
in O
and O
nothing O
. O
Just O
a O
big O
puff O
of O
smoke O
that O
smelled O
awful O
. O
Unplugged O
and O
it O
continued O
to O
smoke O
. O
Very O
disappointed O
in O
this O
. O
Thought O
I O
have O
found O
a O
trusted O
manufacturer O
and O
decently O
priced O
hair O
dryer O
. O
Back O
it O
went O
for O
return O
. O

Good O

Bought O
this O
for O
my O
daughter O
. O
  O
She O
loves O
it O
, O
except O
there O
is O
no O
diffuser O
but O
she O
has O
managed O
. O

Love O
it O
. O
Not O
to O
hot O
, O
drys O
my O
hair O
quickly O
and O
my O
hair O
looks O
fab O
. O
What O
more O
could O
I O
ask O
for O
. O
I O
'm O
glad O
I O
did O
not O
get O
one O
of O
the O
more O
pricey O
dryers O
. O

Works O
very O
well O
and O
fast O
. O
I O
have O
medium O
long O
wavy O
hair O
. O
It O
looks O
very O
healthy O
after O
blow O
drying O
without O
even O
any O
product O
. O
I O
am O
saving O
a O
lot O
by O
not O
having O
to O
use O
products O
in O
my O
hair O
anymore O
. O

Very O
good O
quality O
product O
for O
good O
price O

Perfect O

This O
thing O
had O
sparks O
coming O
out O
of O
it O
, O
so O
I O
called O
Panasonic O
and O
they O
said O
that O
these O
were O
made O
for O
use O
in O
Japan O
. O
They O
say O
100Volts O
on O
them O
. O
Look O
at O
all O
your O
other O
hair O
dyers O
and O
electrical O
appliances O
. O
They O
usually O
say O
120V O
or O
125V.I've O
copied O
and O
pasted O
this O
from O
a O
blog O
where O
someone O
asked O
if O
you O
can O
use O
Japanese O
appliances O
in O
the O
U.S. O
: O
Can O
you O
use O
Japanse O
appliances O
in O
the O
US?I O
am O
an O
electrical O
engineer O
. O
My O
expert O
opinion O
is O
I O
would O
stay O
away O
from O
using O
any O
appliance O
that O
generates O
heat O
... O
such O
as O
a O
hairdryer O
( O
as O
previously O
mentioned O
) O
or O
a O
kotatsu O
or O
a O
boiler O
for O
tea O
water O
... O
unless O
you O
know O
what O
you O
are O
doing!!Japan O
's O
electrical O
system O
is O
roughly O
the O
same O
as O
the O
US O
's O
. O
However O
, O
the O
US O
's O
voltage O
is O
120Vac O
RMS O
( O
60Hz)while O
Japan O
's O
is O
100Vac O
RMS O
( O
50 O
or O
60Hz O
depending O
on O
region).So O
, O
any O
heat O
generating O
device O
from O
Japan O
that O
is O
used O
in O
the O
US O
will O
get O
20 O
% O
hotter O
than O
it O
's O
design O
intended O
. O
The O
risk O
is O
damage O
to O
the O
device O
and/or O
fire O
... O
or O
injury O
of O
a O
person O
. O
Please O
be O
careful!!That O
being O
said O
, O
you O
could O
use O
a O
transformer O
for O
such O
devices O
if O
you O
really O
must O
have O
them O
. O
But O
, O
heat O
generating O
devices O
are O
usually O
pretty O
high O
wattage O
... O
meaning O
you O
'd O
need O
some O
pretty O
hefty O
transformers O
to O
do O
the O
job O
. O
We O
do O
have O
another O
of O
these O
dryers O
that O
's O
a O
slightly O
different O
model O
that O
has O
n't O
sparked O
, O
but O
knowing O
what O
I O
know O
now O
, O
I O
would O
n't O
buy O
another O
. O
I've O
put O
a O
link O
below O
to O
a O
similar O
dryer O
that O
's O
Conair O
brand O
that O
we O
've O
bought O
before O
and O
which O
is O
what O
I O
'm O
replacing O
this O
unit O
with O
. O
There O
may O
be O
other O
brands O
; O
just O
look O
for O
hair O
straightening O
dryer O
or O
something O
like O
that O
. O

I O
have O
had O
a O
couple O
of O
these O
over O
the O
years O
. O
  O
They O
've O
been O
great O
. O
  O
Lasted O
a O
long O
time O
. O
  O
Easy O
to O
mount O
. O
  O
Great O
night O
light O
too O
. O

Great O
dryer O
, O
easy O
to O
hold O
, O
made O
really O
well O
, O
drys O
hair O
in O
no O
time O
at O
all O

My O
old O
blow O
dryer O
broke O
and O
I O
needed O
a O
quick O
replacement O
. O
  O
The O
price O
seemed O
reasonable O
and O
it O
was O
a O
quick O
delivery O
. O
  O
The O
hair O
dryer O
is O
flimsy O
and O
the O
nozzle O
continues O
to O
fall O
off O
from O
day O
one O
. O
  O
I O
never O
had O
the O
time O
to O
pack O
it O
up O
and O
send O
it O
back O
. O
Bad O
me O
for O
not O
returning O
it O
. O

Amazing O
value O
! O

Very O
nice O
hairdryer O
. O
Wishing O
the O
size O
is O
smaller O

Great O

I O
use O
this O
to O
style O
my O
epic O
beard O
. O
It O
is O
great O
. O
The O
only O
down O
side O
I O
can O
thik O
of O
is O
the O
attachment O
only O
fits O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
This O
is O
a O
great O
hair O
dryer O
at O
a O
great O
price O
. O

It O
dries O

! O
I O
had O
brought O
one O
over O
from O
France O
that O
my O
mom O
had O
gotten O
years O
and O
years O
ago O
but O
unfortunately O
I O
was O
never O
able O
to O
get O
the O
same O
power O
due O
to O
the O
voltage O
difference O
. O
I O
ordered O
this O
one O
and O
it O
is O
the O
same O
to O
the O
T O
( O
except O
color O
) O
. O
Cut O
down O
my O
hair O
routine O
in O
half O
. O
It O
does O
fume O
and O
heats O
up O
A O
LOT O
so O
be O
careful!(I O
have O
black O
relaxed O
hair O
) O

Purchased O
several O
of O
these O
a O
few O

she O
bought O
this O
one O
as O

Used O
this O

during O
a O
recent O
trip O
to O
Europe O

  O
So O
easy O
to O
use O
in O
different O
countries O
and O
compact O
to O
carry O

Could O
n't O
ask O
for O
a O
better O
, O
more O
efficient O
dryer O
. O
  O
I O
even O
used O
it O
to O
warm O
cold O
food O
in O
my O
hotel O
room O
, O
but O
do O
n't O

to O
wear O
a O
terry O
headband O
around O
my O
forehead O
, O
ears O
, O
neck O
because O
of O
the O
leakage O
of O
hot O

, O
but O
otherwise O
, O
it O
dried O
my O
curly O
hair O
very O
quickly O

worried O
about O
where O

I O
've O
had O
this O
blow O

for O
about O
six O
months O
. O
It O
dries O
, O
it O
's O
strong O
, O
but O
I O
keep O
smelling O
a O
slight O
burn O
scent O
and O
I O
feel O
like O
it O
's O
just O
about O
ready O
to O
bite O
the O
dust O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
really O
even O
blow O
dry O
my O
hair O
that O
often O
. O
Also O
, O

claims O

be O
ionic O

my O
hair O
is O
totally O
frizzy O
after O
using O
it O

so O
it O
seems O
like O
just O
a O

Underpowered O

This O
is O
our O
second O
wall O
mounted O
hair O
dryer O
and O
I O
can O
see O
some O
improvements O
in O
the O
design O
. O
  O
We O
are O
very O
happy O
with O
its O
performance O
. O

I O
know O
everyone O
has O
said O
this O

is O
awesome O
blah O
blah O
blah O
. O
I O
normally O
love O
Andis O
products O
, O
but O
this O
has O
ended O
their O
winning O
streak O
with O
me O
. O
I O
purchased O
this O
for O
deep O
conditions O
and O
to O
style O
my O
hair O
roller O
sets O
, O
twists O
etc O
. O
This O
bonnet O
is O
so O
small O
it O
only O
fit O
on O
my O
7yr O
olds O
head O
and O
that O
was O
a O
tight O
fit O
. O
I O
really O
tried O
to O
make O
it O
work O
but O
after O
I O
knocked O
all O
my O
pink O
rollers O
loose O
, O
everyone O
got O
a O
hearty O
laugh O
I O
gave O
up O
. O
  O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
they O
used O
small O
models O
for O
the O
design O
or O
maybe O
I O
need O
a O
plus O
size O
head O
bonnet O
either O
way O
it O
was O
a O
return O
for O
me O
. O

Super O

THIS O
BLOW O

IT O

THE O
ONLY O
BLOW O
DRYER O
THAT O
REALLY O
WORKS O
ON O
MY O

DOESN'T O
BREAK O
OR O
BLOW O
OUT O
WHILE O

ONLY O

MORE O
STRONGER O

IT O
CAME O
IN O
PINK O
:) O
  O
OTHER O
THAN O
THAT O
NO O
COMPLAINTS O
! O
! O
! O

Why O
does O
this O
little O
compact O
travel O
dryer O
work O
better O
than O
my O
bigger O
more O
expensive O
hair O
dryer O
? O
Which O
I O
've O
put O
away O
in O
the O
guest O
bathroom O
. O
This O
is O
a O
great O
little O
dryer O
. O
I O
wish O
it O
had O
a O
quick O
cool O
shot O
button O
, O
but O
I O
would O
n't O
avoid O
buying O
it O
for O
that O
reason O
. O

works O
really O
well O
. O

I O
've O
only O
used O
this O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
, O
but O
so O
far O
has O
met O
my O
expectations O
. O
  O
Just O
installed O
a O
new O
handicapped O
shower O
, O
mounted O
this O
just O
outside O
the O
shower O
above O
a O
GFI O
receptacle O
. O
  O
it O
does O
a O
great O
job O
both O
drying O
me O
off O
, O
and O
drying O
the O
many O
shelves O
in O
the O
shower O
which O
hold O
water O
. O
My O
soap O
now O
stays O
dry O
and O
firm O
, O
and O
my O
bath O
mat O
does O
n't O
get O
waterlogged O
. O
Best O
feature O
- O
The O
magnet O
which O
holds O
the O
dryer O
in O
the O
cradle O
. O
Most O
plastic O
latches O
fail O
after O
a O
few O
months O
, O
but O
the O
magnet O
should O
be O
bulletproof O
. O
I O
also O
like O
the O
long O
cord O
which O
reaches O
to O
the O
end O
of O
my O
5 O
foot O
shower O
. O
If O
one O
does O
n't O
have O
a O
backer O
board O
I O
recommend O
Molly O
anchors O
to O
mount O
the O
dryer O
metal O
bracket O
. O

Awesome O
product O
but O
did O
not O
give O
5 O
stars O
because O
it O
did O
n't O
last O
long O
before O
it O
started O
giving O
problems O
. O
For O
the O
money O
paid O
, O
expected O
the O
product O
to O
hold O
up O
longer O
. O

Good O

this O
blow O
dryer O
is O
very O

job O
. O

very O
good O
and O
i O
love O
it O
! O

Junk O
. O
Hard O
to O
clean O
and O
it O
took O
a O
long O
time O
to O
dry O
. O
Other O
retractable O
hair O
dryers O
can O
be O
had O
for O
about O
the O
same O
price O
. O
Started O
to O
get O
a O
rattling O
sound O
inside O
of O
it O
with O
a O
burnt O
smell O
. O

, O
but O
I O
adapted O

  O
The O

a O
wonderful O
feature O
. O

So O

! O

It O

, O
not O
to O
big O
for O
the O
bathroom O
and O
with O
a O

The O

able O
to O
drastically O
cut O
down O
on O
the O
amount O
of O
flat O
- O
ironing O
I O
do O
. O
  O
It O
is O
somewhat O
heavy O
, O
but O
this O
is O
to O
be O
expected O
with O
the O
extra O
power O
that O
it O
provides O
and O
I O
really O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
weight O
. O
  O
I O
love O
the O
heavy O
- O
duty O
, O
long O
cord O
it O
has O
too O
! O
  O
My O
only O
complaint O
is O
one O
that O
I O
have O
heard O
from O
other O
viewers O
- O
the O
control O
buttons O
are O
somewhat O
awkward O
. O
  O
I O
have O
had O
to O
get O
used O
to O
holding O
this O
dryer O
in O
a O
different O
way O
than O
I O
've O
always O
held O
all O
other O
hairdryers O
. O
  O
If O
I O
hold O
it O
in O
the O
usual O
way O
, O
it O
is O
extremely O
easy O
to O
accidentally O
push O
the O
buttons O
with O
your O
hand O
and O
inadvertently O
change O
the O
settings O
. O
  O
Other O
than O
this O
small O
issue O
, O
which O
I O
am O
already O
getting O
used O
to O
dealing O
with O
, O
I O
think O
this O
is O
probably O
the O
best O
dryer O
that O
I O
have O
ever O
used O
. O

This O
is O
an O
okay O
product O
. O
If O
you O
avidly O
blow O
- O
dry O
your O
hair O
get O
a O
bigger O
one O
. O
But O
for O
the O
occasional O
use O
it O
's O
okay O

this O
is O
perfect O
, O
works O
great O
and O
so O
easy O
travel O
with O
due O
to O
is O
compact O
size O
. O

Before O
I O
ever O
used O
this O
product O
I O
thought O
all O
hair O
dryers O
are O
the O
same O
because O
they O
simply O
just O
blow O
air O
. O
After O
used O
my O
friend O
's O
Panasonic O
Nano O
hair O
dryer O
, O
I O
knew O
I O
was O
wrong O
. O
This O
is O
so O
much O
better O
than O
the O
cheap O
dryer O
I O
bought O
at O
supermarket O
. O
My O
hair O
was O
n't O
at O
all O
frizzy O
with O
this O
new O
hair O
dryer O
. O
I O
'm O
in O
love O
with O
this O
product O

I O
love O
this O
dryer O
and O
wish O
they O
made O
it O
in O
a O
smaller O
travel O
size O
. O
Only O
drawback O
is O
that O
the O
attachment O
bends O
easily O
so O
if O
you O
pack O
it O
make O
sure O
to O
take O
it O
off O
first O
. O
It O
heats O
up O
better O
than O
any O
other O
dryer O
I O
've O
used O
and O
my O
salon O
uses O
these O
exclusively O
. O

The O
only O
reason O
I O
can O
not O
give O
it O
5 O
stars O
is O
because O
it O
will O
not O
stick O
to O
my O
vanity O
which O
is O
made O
out O
of O
wood O
. O
It O
wo O
n’t O
hold O
in O
place O
after O
I O
place O
the O
blow O
dryer O
. O
Does O
stick O
very O
well O
to O
my O
vanity O
in O
the O
bathroom O
( O
glass O
/ O
marble O
) O
. O

Great O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
Does O
n't O
cause O
too O
much O
frizz O
. O
  O
Love O
the O
retractable O
cord O
. O

Great O
for O
drying O
hair O
! O

I O
'm O
not O
completely O
impressed O
with O
the O
cheap O
plastic O
although O
, O
I O
ve O
used O
it O
about O
6 O
times O
and O
it O
's O
still O
in O
good O
condition O
( O
also O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
I O
am O
hispanic O
and O
have O
very O
long O
, O
thick O
and O
curly O
hair O
) O
. O
I O
purchased O
this O
because O
my O
daughter O
has O
one O
and O
after O
using O
it O
, O
I O
fell O
in O
love O
. O
But O
, O
hers O
is O
definitely O
made O
with O
better O
quality O
materials O
, O
you O
can O
tell O
by O
just O
holding O
both O
of O
them O
in O
your O
hands O
the O
difference O
in O
quality O
. O
  O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
getting O
a O
super O
steal O
based O
on O
the O
price O
I O
paid O
for O
it O
( O
$ O
25 O
) O
opposed O
to O
what O
my O
daughter O
paid O
( O
she O
purchased O
hers O
directly O
from O
Andis O
for O
$ O
52 O
) O
As O
I O
previously O
mentioned O
, O
mines O
is O
still O
in O
good O
condition O
after O
using O
it O
several O
times O
, O
I O
'm O
just O
waiting O
to O
see O
how O
many O
more O
uses O
I O
get O
out O
of O
it O
. O
This O
is O
a O
case O
of O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
. O

Very O
fprceful O
and O
dries O
my O
hair O
in O
5 O
minutes O
- O
just O
like O
the O
professionals O
do O
it O
. O

The O
lower O
setting O
does O
not O
work O

I O
bought O
this O
Two O
days O
ago O
as O
my O
old O
dryer O
( O
conair O
1875 O
watt O
) O
has O
n't O
been O
drying O
as O
well O
lately O
. O
  O
I O
was O
impressed O
immediately O
with O
this O
dryer O
. O
  O
It O
is O
beautiful O
. O
  O
It O
is O
slightly O
heavier O
than O
my O
last O
one O
, O
  O
but O
it O
cut O
drying O
time O
considerably O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
this O
will O
be O
an O
issue O
. O
  O
It O
has O
three O
speeds O
. O
  O
It O
has O
three O
temperature O
settings O
. O
The O
highest O
is O
hotter O
than O
any O
blow O
dryer O
i O
have O
ever O
used O
. O
  O
I O
just O
dried O
my O
hair O
with O
it O
and O
my O
naturally O
wavy O
hair O
is O
so O
straight O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
break O
out O
my O
flat O
iron O
. O
Yes O
, O
I O
am O
amazed O
by O
this O
thing O
! O
The O
medium O
heat O
setting O
is O
equivalent O
to O
my O
last O
dryers O
hottest O
setting O
. O
  O
I O
have O
twin O
daughters O
that O
are O
young O
and O
I O
think O
the O
only O
setting O
cool O
enough O
to O
dry O
their O
hair O
with O
is O
the O
lowest O
heat O
Setting O
. O
This O
dryer O
is O
so O
powerful O
, O
  O
yet O
a O
ton O
quieter O
than O
my O
previous O
dryer O
. O
My O
husband O
even O
commented O
on O
how O
quiet O
it O
is O
. O
My O
husband O
also O
liked O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
is O
heavier O
. O
  O
Being O
a O
mechanic O
he O
said O
it O
probably O
has O
a O
stronger O
, O
  O
more O
durable O
motor O
. O
I O
was O
reading O
the O
booklet O
that O
was O
included O
, O
and O
this O
dryer O
has O
a O
four O
year O
warranty O
. O
  O
That O
's O
pretty O
astounding O
considering O
the O
price O
point O
. O
  O
I O
love O
this O
dryer O
, O
  O
and O
I O
'd O
buy O
it O
again O
in O
a O
heart O
beat O
. O
  O
I O
'm O
thinking O
about O
buying O
another O
one O
to O
store O
, O
  O
because O
I O
seriously O
love O
it O
that O
much O
! O
  O
Go O
buy O
it O
! O

The O
description O
for O
this O
product O
is O
incorrect O
. O
  O
It O
does O
not O
contain O
a O
cool O
shot O
button O

Used O
once O
on O
vacation O
so O
I O
can O
not O
comment O
on O
the O
longevity O
of O
this O
product O
. O
Size O
is O
slightly O
bigger O
than O
I O
had O
hoped O
, O
but O
I O
bought O
it O
because O
it O
was O
the O
best O
looking O
diffuser O

come O
w. O
a O
travel O
dryer O
that O
I O
could O
find O
. O
  O
Price O
was O
right O
and O
I O
think O
it O
was O
a O
good O
investment O
for O
a O
travel O
dryer O
only- O
I O
would O
not O
use O
this O
for O
regular O
at O

use O
. O

The O
wife O
is O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
. O
  O
It O
was O
a O
replacement O
of O
a O
similar O
Conair O
that O
lasted O
many O
years O
. O
  O
This O
one O
has O
held O
up O
for O
a O
few O
months O
now O
and O
looks O
like O
it O
will O
hold O
up O
like O
the O
old O
one O
. O
  O
I O
am O
pretty O
sure O
she O
will O
buy O
a O
similar O

many O
of O
the O
reviewers O
I O
read O
listed O
that O
as O
a O
con O
. O
As O
for O
how O
quiet O
it O
is O
, O
I O
would O
say O
it O
's O
as O
quiet O
as O
the O
other O
quiet O
dryers O
I O
've O
owned O
made O
by O
other O
companies O
. O
It O
's O
not O
a O
whisper O
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O
a O
scream O
. O
My O
hair O
looks O
better O
than O
it O
has O
in O
a O
long O
time O
... O
It O
's O
certainly O
shinier O
and O
looks O
thicker O
when O
I O
use O
this O
dryer O
. O
The O
dryer O
is O
also O
a O
very O
sexy O
looking O
piece O
, O
so O
if O
you O
're O
going O
buy O
based O
on O
looks O
, O
go O
for O
this O
machine O
! O
The O
only O
negative O
I O
have O
is O
the O
cold O
shot O
button O
. O
I O
foresee O
this O
button O
breaking O
easily O
and O
in O
the O
near O
future O
. O
I O
try O
to O
avoid O
using O
the O
shot O
button O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
cold O
setting O
switch O
to O
prolong O
the O
inevitable O
, O
though O
. O
  O
I O
truly O
do O
love O
this O
dryer O
. O
I O
was O
not O
compensated O
for O
my O
review O
. O
I O
bought O
the O
dryer O
after O
researching O
. O
I O
'm O
very O
happy O
with O
my O
purchase O
! O

Powerful O
, O
and O
quiet O
. O
It O
does O
n't O
have O
that O
high O
pitched O
whine O
. O
It O
does O
n't O
get O
super O
hot O
and O
does O
n't O
have O
to O
because O
it O
's O
powerful O
enough O
. O
Other O
dryers O
would O
make O
my O
hair O
hot O
to O
the O
touch O
or O
burn O
my O
hand O
. O
My O
hair O
seems O
to O
be O
healthier O
and O
smoother O
after O
using O
this O
for O
a O
couple O
months O
too O
! O

The O
best O

found O
. O
So O
much O
power O
in O
this O

be O
more O
compact O
, O
for O
traveling O
. O
Just O
a O
little O
big O
but O
okay O

Dried O

the O
short O
side O
. O

Very O

a O
happy O
customer O
. O

Perfect O

Seems O
to O
work O
. O
Do O
n't O
use O
it O
much O
. O

Very O
heavy O
, O
did O
n't O
get O
hot O
enough O
to O

. O
  O
Returned O
it O

Great O
dryer O
! O
Dries O
fast O
... O
The O
hottest O
setting O
is O
really O
hot O
so O
be O
careful O
not O
to O
burn O
yourself O
! O

This O
little O
hair O
dryer O
is O
great O
! O
I O
had O
one O
just O
like O
it O
in O
the O
past O
. O
It O
lasted O
20 O
years O
. O
It O
fits O
perfectly O
in O
my O
suit O
case O
, O
has O
just O
the O
right O
amount O
of O
power O
and O
heat O
. O
It O
is O
much O
better O
than O
others O
I O
have O
used O
( O
they O
did O
not O
last O
long O
) O
. O
It O
is O
well O
constructed O
too O
. O
A O
good O
purchase O
. O
I O
had O
looked O
every O
where O
for O
a O
replacement O
and O
had O
to O
settle O
for O
inferior O
products O
. O
I O
am O
really O
happy O
Amazon O
had O
it O
. O
I O
highly O
recommend O
. O

I O
have O
had O
better O
conair O
products O
in O
the O
past O
. O

Love O
love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
My O
first O
time O
to O
own O
a O
Turbo O
Power O
but O
should O
have O
been O
buying O
for O
years O
. O
Live O
and O
learn!I O
have O
very O
fine O
, O
thin O
, O
hair O
and O
all O
my O
other O
dryers O
have O
been O
to O
harsh O
on O
my O
fragile O
locks O
with O
1875 O
watts O
. O
After O
researching O
the O
best O
for O
my O
hair O
issues O
- O
the O
lower O
wattage O
, O
1500 O
, O
  O
is O
perfect O
and O
dries O
my O
hair O
beautifully O
, O
smooth O
and O
shinny O
. O
This O
dryer O
is O
also O
very O
substantial O
in O
motor O
which O
is O
important O
to O
me O
so O
it O
will O
last O
. O

Very O
lightweight O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
end O
up O
with O
cramped O
arms O
after O
using O
these O
. O
The O
buttons O
are O
also O
placed O
away O
from O
my O
fingers O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
accidentally O
turn O
them O
off O
. O

Bargain O

good O
. O

Only O
had O
my O

for O
a O
month O
but O
so O
far O
it O
's O
the O
best O

I O
've O
ever O
had O
. O
  O
Ionic O

Tucked O
out O
of O
the O
way O
in O
the O
female O
's O
bathroom O
of O
my O
home O
. O
I O
also O
purchased O
one O
for O
the O
male O
's O
bathroom O
in O
the O
house O
and O
will O
put O
in O
the O
master O
bathroom O
once O
I O
am O
complete O
with O
the O
remodel O
so O
if O
I O
ever O
get O
married O
again O
she O
will O
have O
one O
to O
use O
. O
great O
night O
light O
also O
. O
never O
have O
to O
turn O
on O
the O
bathroom O
light O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night O
.. O

It O
is O
the O
best O
hair O
dryer O
I O
have O
! O
I O
used O
have O
a O
old O
one O
which O
I O
used O
for O
many O
years O
! O
Best O
quality O
! O

Fairly O
quiet O
as O
hair O
dryers O
go O
. O
Like O
the O
attachments O
. O
LOVE O
the O
brown O
and O
pink O
color O
. O

Excellent O
product O
. O
  O
This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
hair O
dryer O
i O
have O
ever O
own O
. O
  O
Highly O
recommended O
:-) O

Decided O
to O
buy O
this O
hairdryer O
based O
on O
all O
the O
positive O
reviews O
. O
  O
I O
am O
very O
pleased O
with O
my O
purchase O
. O
The O
reviews O
are O
accurate O
and O
the O
price O
is O
great O
too O
. O

Overall O
I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
product O
. O
  O
My O
old O
blowdryer O
was O
awkward O
to O
work O
with O
and O
weak O
, O
and O
I O
would O
only O
blow O
dry O
my O
hair O
for O
special O
occasions O
. O
  O
Now O
I O
blow O
dry O
my O
hair O
every O
time O
it O
's O
washed O
. O
  O
My O
blow O
- O
dry O
time O
has O
been O
cut O
in O
half O
with O
this O
blow O
dryer O
. O
  O
It O
's O
much O
more O
powerful O
than O
similarly O
priced O
blow O
dryers O
. O
  O
It O
has O
a O
long O
, O
sturdy O
power O
cord O
, O
which O
makes O
the O
dryer O
easier O
to O
maneuver O
around O
to O
dry O
and O
style O
your O
hair O
. O
  O
It O
comes O
with O
a O
nozzle O
but O
not O
a O
diffuser O
, O
so O
if O
you O
use O
a O
diffuser O
you O
'll O
need O
to O
purchase O
one O
separately O
. O

Fantastic O
hair O
dryer O
! O
Was O
searching O
for O
a O
new O
hair O
dryer O
as O
my O
hot O
tools O
dryer O
was O
giving O
off O
a O
burning O
smell O
and O
really O
drying O
out O
my O
hair O
. O
I O
decided O
on O
xtava O
because O
of O
the O
good O
reviews O
and O
so O
glad O
I O
purchased O
it O
. O
  O
The O
nozzle O
for O
the O
dryer O
stays O
firmly O
in O
place O
which O
is O
fantastic O
since O
when O
I O
tried O
to O
use O
one O
on O
my O
previous O
dryers O
, O
it O
would O
always O
fall O
off O
. O
  O
My O
hair O
comes O
out O
super O
smooth O
. O
  O
It O
is O
very O
powerful O
and O
not O
super O
noisy O
. O
Another O
great O
feature O
is O
the O
removable O
back O
to O
clean O
out O
lint O
! O
I O
was O
also O
really O
impressed O
with O
the O
welcome O
letter O
from O
the O
company O
I O
received O
via O
email O
after O
I O
received O
the O
dryers O
with O
tips O
on O
blow O
drying O
my O
hair O
. O
Would O
definitely O
recommend O
this O
dryer O
to O
anyone O
I O
know O
. O

Love O
it O
! O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
much O
about O
ionic O
dryers O
because O
I O
previously O
had O
the O
same O
hair O
dryer O
for O
over O
15 O
years O
. O
I O
like O
this O
one O
so O
far O
. O
It O
is O
sturdy O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
consider O
it O
heavy O
. O
It O
has O
enough O
heat O
settings O
in O
my O
opinion O
and O
also O
includes O
a O
cool O
setting O
, O
similar O
to O
a O
hooded O
dryer O
, O
which O
I O
like O
, O
my O
last O
dryer O
did O
not O
have O
this O
. O

this O
is O
my O
2nd O
purchase O
of O
this O
product O
I O
wore O
the O
first O
one O
out O
after O
11 O
years O
! O
it O
still O
worked O
but O
the O
black O
cover O
blocking O
the O
heat O
would O
no O
longer O
stay O
on O
. O
I O
love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
it O
leaves O
my O
hair O
so O
soft O
no O
frizz O
! O
Well O
worth O
the O
money O
.. O
one O
of O
those O
cases O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
! O

Bonnet O
is O
so O
rediculously O
small O
it O
could O
not O
be O
placed O
on O
head O
of O
adult O
, O
let O
alone O
dry O
hair O
on O
rollers O
. O
I O
ca O
n't O
imagine O
what O
the O
professional O
is O
, O
certainly O
not O
a O
hair O
salon O
with O
this O
quality O
! O
  O
Disappointing O
. O
  O
Time O
consuming O
. O
Received O
when O
I O
got O
home O
5/7 O
. O
Diirected O
by O
Amazon O
to O
be O
returned O
by O
5/7 O
! O
  O
Silly O
waste O
. O

Very O
pleased O
with O
the O
dryer O
. O
  O
It O
's O
a O
little O
heavier O
than O
my O
last O
one O
, O
but O
does O
a O
great O
job O
. O
I O
would O
recommend O
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
blow O
dryer O
. O
Even O
my O
mother O
- O
in O
- O
law O
said O
it O
is O
awesome O
. O
It O
is O
powerful O
and O
dries O
my O
hair O
fast O
. O
I O
plan O
to O
look O
at O
other O
products O
made O
by O
them O
as O
well O
. O

Sweet O
, O
works O
as O
expected O
! O

I O
love O
it O
, O
it O
fits O
my O
little O
peanut O
head O
just O
fine O
and O
really O
snug O
. O
I O
used O
it O
to O
deep O
condition O
my O
hair O
with O
a O
plastic O
cap O
and O
silk O
bonnet O
on O
top O
then O
the O
hair O
dryer O
bonnet O
. O
I O
used O
the O
silk O
bonnet O
to O
protect O
my O
ears O
and O
neck O
from O
getting O
to O
hot O
. O
This O
is O
the O
first O
time O
I O
have O
ordered O
this O
and O
I O
'm O
very O

Highly O
satisfied O
with O
the O

normally O
takes O
me O
20 O
- O
30 O
minutes O
to O
get O
it O
completely O
dry O
. O
Then O
I O
need O
to O
use O
the O
flat O
iron O
to O
calm O
it O
all O
down O
. O
With O
this O
hair O
dryer O
I O
had O
it O
completely O
dry O
in O
10 O
minutes O
. O
When O
I O
use O
it O
with O
the O
Goody O
Quikstyle O
brush O
my O
hair O
is O
smooth O
enough O
that O
I O
only O
have O
to O
touch O
up O
a O
couple O
places O
with O
the O
flat O
iron O
. O
I O
live O
in O
the O
Deep O
South O
. O
Heat O
and O
humidity O
are O
a O
way O
of O
life O
. O
I O
ca O
n't O
tell O
you O
how O
happy O
I O
am O
with O
a O
hair O
dryer O
that O
cuts O
10 O
- O
20 O
minutes O
off O
the O
time O
I O
have O
to O
spend O
blowing O
more O
hot O
air O
my O
way O
. O
Also O

I O
have O
received O
two O
very O
service O
minded O

from O
the O

is O
because O
of O
these O
that O
I O
was O
prompted O
to O
write O
a O
review O
. O
  O
A O
quality O
product O
and O
a O
customer O
service O
driven O
company O
deserve O
a O
shout O
out O

only O
got O
to O
use O
it O
3 O
times._____Purchased O

  O
Wow O
this O
little O
dryer O
is O
quite O
powerful O
. O
  O
the O
switch O
was O
a O
little O
stiff O
to O
turn O
on O
at O
first O
and O
if O
feels O
a O
little O
cheap O
but O
Torumaliine O

little O
power O
house O

  O
love O
it O
. O

broke O
my O
arm O
and O
went O
on O
vacation O
so O
this O
little O
gadget O
hellped O
a O
lot O
. O
It O
will O
not O
hold O
a O
heavy O
dryer O
, O
but O
worked O
fine O
with O
a O
travel O
dryer O
. O
Suction O
will O
not O
work O
on O
a O
porous O
surface O
but O
did O
fine O
on O
a O
mirror O
or O
glass O
shower O
door O
. O

Best O
hairdryer O
I O
have O
ever O
used O
. O
  O
Large O
impellers O
really O
put O
out O
some O
air O
which O
speeds O
drying O
. O
  O
Can O
be O
very O
powerful O
or O
not O
depending O
on O
the O
setting O
you O
choose O
. O

excellent O
I O
love O
it O

Perfect O
hairdryer O
. O

Wonderful O
! O
Just O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
. O
I O
have O
medium O
length O
, O
thick O
, O
wavy O
hair O
. O
It O
smooths O
as O
it O
dries O
. O
Is O
light O
weight O
and O
quiet O
. O
And O
I O
love O
how O
hot O
it O
gets- O
lets O
me O
know O
its O
really O
working O
! O

excellent O

My O
hair O
normally O
takes O
forever O
to O
dry O
, O
but O
not O
with O
this O
dryer O
. O
It O
  O
drys O
so O
quickly O
and O
will O
NOT O
dry O
out O
your O
hair O
. O
Worth O
every O
penny O

I O
like O
it O
but O
the O
only O
problem O
is O
everytime O
I O
dry O
my O
hair O
, O
the O
front O
cover O
always O
falling O
out O
:( O

It O
works O
ok O
but O
it O
's O
not O
the O
easiest O
drier O
to O
use O
. O
It O
has O
an O
odor O
to O
it O
and O
I O
wish O
it O
was O
just O
a O
little O
smaller O
in O
size O

Very O
good O

This O
is O
a O
very O
nice O
dryer O
. O

Suits O
my O
needs O
very O
well O
. O
Quiet O
and O
compact O
. O

The O
dryer O
seems O
to O
be O
of O
good O
quality O
and O
would O
be O
easy O
to O
use O
if O
the O
nozzle O
were O
shorter O
. O
  O
I O
like O
the O
hairdryer O
itself O
very O
much O
but O
the O
nozzle O
is O
so O
long O
that O
I O
ca O
n't O
style O
the O
back O
of O
my O
hair O
easily O
. O
  O
I O
have O
shorter O
arms O
but O
I O
have O
never O
had O
this O
problem O
with O
other O
hair O
dryers O
. O
  O
Do O
you O
have O
a O
shorter O
nozzle O
to O
fit O
this O
dryer O
? O
  O
I O
bought O
this O
dryer O
because O
my O
old O
one O
was O
wearing O
out O
and O
a O
piece O
of O
the O
nozzle O
came O
off O
- O
making O
it O
difficult O
to O
use O
. O

I O
tend O
to O
have O
frizzy O
hair O
. O
  O
I O
honestly O
have O
n't O
noticed O
a O
difference O
between O
this O
hair O
dryer O
or O
any O
old O
regular O
hair O
dryer O
making O
my O
hair O
less O
frizzy O
. O
  O
I O
ordered O
this O
one O
because O
my O
old O
one O
broke O
. O
  O
I O
'm O
not O
noticing O
any O
difference O
. O

This O
dryer O
works O
well O
for O
a O
time O
, O
but O
breaks O
easily O
. O
I O
've O
replaced O
it O
3 O
times O
! O
THREE O
! O
I O
bought O
it O
because O
it O
was O
the O
cheapest O
option O
, O
but O
after O
purchasing O
it O
3 O
times O
, O
I O
should O
've O
just O
gone O
with O
a O
higher O
end O
model O
. O

Stopped O
working O
after O
3 O
months O
. O

Not O
recommended O
. O
  O
It O
does O
n't O
get O
hot O
and O
the O
comb O
was O
flimsy O
. O
Very O
disappointed O

Perfect O
size O
for O
traveling O
abroad O
and O
the O
price O
was O
right O
! O
I O
wish O
it O
was O
a O
tad O
more O
powerful O
but O
I O
can O
live O
with O
it O
as O
is O
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
good O
dryer O
, O
I O
give O
it O
5 O
stars O
. O
Thanks O

Very O
small O
and O
very O
light O
. O
  O
Perfect O
for O
travel O
and O
my O
silicon O
diffuser O
fits O
right O
over O
the O
nozzles O
. O
  O
I O
recommend O
this O
product O
. O

fit O
right O
where O
we O
needed O
it O
in O
our O
motorhome O

Heavy O
Duty O
awesome O
dryer O
. O
The O
cord O
alone O
lends O
itself O
to O
the O
words O
heavy O
duty O
. O
Powerful O
, O
light O
weight O
, O
multi O
- O
heating O
options O
. O
The O
best O
dryer O
I O
've O
ever O
purchased O
in O
my O
50 O
+ O
years O
, O
that O
is O
when O
hand O
held O
dryers O
began O
. O
I O
have O
long O
hair O
and O
it O
's O
cut O
my O
time O
in O
half O
. O
I O
ca O
n't O
say O
more O
other O
than O
I O
hope O
it O
last O
me O
a O
long O
time O
. O

Thought O
it O
would O
be O
more O
powerful O
, O
is O
it O
really O
2000 O
watts O
? O

Extremely O
fast O
delivery O
and O
the O
product O
works O
great O
. O
Very O
happy O
! O

it O
's O
great O
i O
enjoy O
working O
it O
. O
thanks O
much O
  O

as O
expected O
! O
good O

I O
would O
give O
it O
zero O
stars O
if O
I O
could O
but O
unfortunately O
that O
is O
not O
an O
option O
. O
I O
bought O
this O
product O
because O
it O
was O
dual O
voltage O
, O
and O
it O
not O
only O
burnt O
in O
the O
first O
time O
I O
used O
it O
, O
it O
also O
caught O
fire O
. O
I O
strongly O
do O
not O
recommend O
anyone O
to O
buy O
this O
product O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
on O
the O
recommendation O
of O
my O
stylist O
and O
I O
hate O
it O
. O
  O
The O
hot O
setting O
is O
too O
hot O
and O
burns O
my O
scalp O
, O
the O
power O
is O
too O
strong O
and O
makes O
my O
hair O
completely O
flat O
and O
yet O
, O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
dry O
it O
unless O
it O
's O
on O
these O
higher O
settings O
. O
  O
Also O
, O
it O
is O
a O
very O
heavy O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
I O
am O
very O
disappointed O
in O
this O
product O
. O
  O
Wish O
I O
had O
kept O
the O
box O
to O
return O
. O
  O
This O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
splurge O
. O

Dries O
my O
hair O
incredibly O
quickly O
. O
What O
used O
to O
take O
20 O
minutes O
now O
takes O
5 O
, O
it O
makes O
getting O
ready O
in O
the O
morning O
much O
more O
pleasant O
. O

I O
like O
how O
it O
has O
a O
low O
, O
medium O
, O
and O
high O
setting O
. O
  O
( O
Have O
nt O
bought O
a O
new O
dryer O
in O
a O
while O
:) O
  O
i O
just O
wish O
the O
concentrator O
was O
a O
bit O
thinner O
since O
that O
would O
cause O
less O
frizz O
. O

I O
have O
long O
thick O
hair O
and O
I O
go O
through O
blow O
dryers O
like O
crazy O
. O
This O
blow O
dryer O
dries O
my O
hair O
quickly O
. O
It O
's O
not O
too O
heavy O
and O
is O
easy O
to O
hold O
. O
Love O
it O
! O

I O
recently O
became O
aware O
of O
Xtava O
products O
while O
looking O
for O
a O
new O
hairdryer O
. O
I O
wanted O
the O
ceramic O
ionic O
technology O
as O
I O
have O
baby O
fine O
hair O
which O
tends O
to O
break O
and O
attract O
static O
way O
too O
easily O
. O
This O
hair O
dryer O
has O
been O
amazing O
. O
It O
's O
super O
quiet O
and O
has O
multiple O
heat O
levels O
which O
is O
great O
. O
I O
can O
usually O
dry O
my O
hair O
in O
about O
4 O
to O
5 O
minutes O
. O
I O
use O
the O
dryer O
with O
a O
flat O
brush O
, O
and O
have O
noticed O
my O
hair O
is O
smooth O
, O
shiny O
, O
and O
frizz O
free O
. O
I O
also O
have O
to O
say O
that O
Xtava O
has O
excellent O
customer O
service O
. O
When O
I O
originally O
purchased O
the O
dryer O
, O
Amazon O
fulfilled O
the O
order O
and O
shipped O
the O
wrong O
one O
. O
Xtava O
was O
super O
helpful O
in O
getting O
the O
issue O
resolved O
with O
Amazon O
. O
I O
now O
own O
two O
Xtava O
dryers O
and O
love O
them O
both O
. O
I O
'm O
really O
happy O
with O
my O
purchases O
, O
and O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
Xtava O
products O
. O
I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
dryer O
. O

I O
have O
had O
three O
of O
these O
over O
the O
years O
. O
Ionizing O
dryer O
keeps O
the O
frizz O
out O
of O
your O
hair O
. O
Cool O
setting O
is O
nice O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
two O
settings O
for O
hot O
, O
blasting O
and O
normal O
. O

The O

  O
Great O
little O
hair O

. O

This O
is O
the O
4th O
time O
I O
've O
bought O
this O
dryer O
over O
the O
course O
of O
a O
several O
years O
. O
It O
does O
fail O
at O
some O
point O
, O
but O
at O
the O
constant O
daily O
use O
it O
gets O
. O
Still O
very O
worth O
the O
price O
, O
it O
's O
quite O
powerful O
and O
puts O
out O
more O
heat O
and O
airflow O
than O
others O
I O
've O
used O
. O
Very O
happy O
with O
it O
overall O
! O

over O
priced O
junk O

Excellent O
noise O
levels O
-- O
very O
low O
. O
Heat O
control O
very O
good O
as O
well O
. O
Great O
hairdryer O
so O
far O
, O
particularly O
vs. O
previous O
Conair O
models O
. O

The O
retractable O
cord O
is O
wonderful O
for O
storage O
. O
  O
Power O
is O
great O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
hair O
dryer O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
ago O
after O
my O
old O
Conair O
died O
. O
  O
I O
like O
to O
use O
my O
dryers O
on O
low O
speed O
, O
but O
high O
heat O
. O
  O
Although O
the O
two O
settings O
should O
be O
independent O
, O
this O
dryer O
is O
just O
lukewarm O
on O
low O
speed O
. O
  O
It O
also O
made O
my O
hair O
fuzzy O
, O
and O
while O
it O
was O
lightweight O
- O
it O
felt O
cheap O
. O
I O
quit O
using O
it O
two O
months O
after O
I O
started O
using O
it O
and O
invested O
in O
a O
better O
dryer O
. O
  O
I O
purchased O
the O
Elchim O
2001 O
through O
Amazon O
, O
and O
while O
it O
's O
a O
bit O
more O
expensive O
( O
$ O
80 O
) O
, O
it O
's O
worth O
every O
penny O
. O
  O
I O
would O
not O
recommend O
the O
Conair O
1875 O
, O
unless O
you O
want O
your O
hair O
to O
look O
like O
a O
fuzzy O
mess O
. O

Great O
performance O
but O
they O
need O
work O
on O
the O
product O
painting O
, O
the O
paint O
started O
pilling O
after O
a O
few O
day O
's O
using O
the O
dryer O
but O
in O
general O
it O
's O
a O
great O
product O
for O
the O
price O

great O
product O
for O
price O

The O
dryer O
work O
fine O
for O
about O
10 O
months O
but O
it O
did O
end O
up O
catching O
fire O
while O
I O
was O
using O
it O
. O
I O
think O
for O
the O
price O
it O
should O
last O
longer O
than O
10 O
  O
months O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
little O
dryer O
. O
I O
bought O
it O
after O
using O
one O
in O
a O
hotel O
and O
wanting O
one O
for O
myself O
. O
It O
is O
very O
basic O
but O
does O
the O
job O
without O
destroying O
my O
eardrums O
. O
A O
minor O
complaint O
is O
that O
the O
cord O
is O
bit O
on O
the O
short O
side O
, O
but O
I O
cope O
with O
it O
. O

Great O
little O
dryer O

The O
motor O
died O
after O
a O
year O
of O
very O
light O
use O
. O
( O
2 O
- O
3x O
/ O
month O
) O
. O
It O
was O
a O
very O
poor O
value O
for O
the O
$ O
80 O
I O
paid O
in O
Sept O
2013.I O
was O
n't O
very O
impressed O
even O
while O
it O
was O
functioning O
. O
Blowout O
styling O
results O
were O
not O
as O
good O
as O
I O
get O
with O
my O
drugstore O
cheapie O
; O
hairs O
would O
get O
chomped O
and O
tangled O
in O
the O
dryer O
; O
poor O
button O
placement O
so O
the O
controls O
were O
frequently O
switched O
on O
/ O
off O
, O
high O
/ O
low O
by O
the O
palm O
of O
my O
hand O
while O
I O
was O
trying O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
. O
( O
Maybe O
I O
gripped O
it O
funny O
, O
but O
it O
did O
annoy O
me O
every O
time O
I O
used O
it O
) O

makes O
my O
hair O
smooth O

Wow O
, O
this O
dryer O
came O
in O
and O
I O
was O
so O
happy O
with O
the O
design O
and O
color O
of O
it O
. O
It O
also O
came O
in O
the O
nick O
of O
time O
as O
my O
much O
cheaper O
hair O
dryer O
had O
just O
went O
out O
. O
Believe O
me O
when O
I O
say O
this O
hair O
dryer O
is O
top O
of O
the O
line O
! O
Straight O
out O
of O
the O
box O
I O
noticed O
that O
it O
was O
light O
weight O
and O
had O
a O
sleek O
design O
. O
Upon O
use O
of O
this O
product O
I O
seen O
that O
it O
had O
several O
different O
settings O
as O
to O
get O
the O
desired O
drying O
time O
you O
'd O
like O
. O
It O
includes O
a O
diffuser O
to O
keep O
your O
hair O
from O
getting O
too O
overheated O
and O
dried O
out O
plus O
it O
has O
a O
reset O
and O
test O
button O
on O
the O
plug O
in O
. O
When O
I O
used O
this O
hair O
dryer O
I O
noticed O
that O
at O
the O
highest O
heat O
that O
the O
air O
is O
not O
super O
strong O
like O
some O
other O
hair O
dryers O
out O
there O
, O
but O
it O
definitely O
dries O
your O
hair O
in O
record O
time O
! O
This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
easy O
to O
hold O
on O
to O
whilst O
drying O
your O
hair O
and O
has O
a O
good O
vent O
on O
the O
back O
as O
to O
not O
clog O
up O
easily O
. O
I O
recommend O
this O
hair O
dryer O
to O
anyone O
looking O
for O
a O
new O
replacement O
because O
it O
work O
really O
well O
and O
is O
high O
quality O
for O
your O
money O
. O
I O
got O
this O
product O
for O
purpose O
of O
review O
, O
all O
claims O
and O
views O
are O
100 O
percent O
my O
own O
. O

Was O
advertised O
as O
red O
and O
came O
as O
salmon O
pink O
. O
Lasted O
roughly O
2 O
years O
before O
the O
heating O
element O
went O
out O
. O
Also O
, O
fairly O
weak O
fan O
. O

Used O
to O
a O
little O
more O
power O
but O
from O
a O
small O
( O
hotel O
- O
like O
) O
dryer O
, O
it O
works O
well O
. O

I O
am O
so O
excited O
by O
this O
dryer O
. O
It O
much O
quieter O
than O
my O
old O
one O
and O
dries O
my O
hair O
super O
fast O
without O
feeling O
dried O
out O
. O

Horrible O

the O
non O
- O
skid O
rubber O
thingies O
on O
the O
sides O
of O
the O
dryer O
so O
it O
does O
n't O
slip O
off O
bathroom O
shelf O
. O
  O
The O
overall O
drying O
could O
be O
improved O
. O
  O
My O
Vidal O
Sassoon O
travel O
dryer O
of O
the O
same O
wattage O
dried O
my O
hair O
much O
faster O
. O
  O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
buy O
another O
one O
of O
those O
again O
and O
just O
keep O
this O
one O
as O
a O
backup O
dryer O
in O
our O
guest O
bath O
. O

Powerful O
as O
any O
other O

Compact O

ligthweight O
enough O
for O
my O
overseas O

  O
And O
so O
convenient O
to O
not O
have O
to O
carry O
a O
converter O
. O
  O
I O
absolutely O
recommend O
at O
this O
price O
. O

Had O
one O
of O
these O
in O
dark O
blue O
for O
years O
, O
it O
finally O
gave O
out O
. O
This O
one O
is O
alright O
, O
but O
feels O
lighted O
and O
cheaper O
made O
then O
my O
old O

. O
Love O

. O

Dryer O

extremely O
heavy O
! O
  O
Not O
as O
hot O
or O
strong O
as O
other O
comparably O
priced O

. O
  O
Buttons O

BEST O
BLOWDRYER O
for O
NATURAL O
GIRLS O
. O
I O
Never O
use O
anything O

A O
little O
heavy O
for O
a O
travel O
dryer O

very O
fast O
drying O
experience O
! O

I O
absolutely O
love O
that O
it O
offers O
the O
two O
heat O
settings O
and O
separate O
speeds O
. O
My O
old O
dryer O
only O
had O
one O
control O
and O
if O
you O
wanted O
high O
speed O
it O
meant O
you O
had O
to O
have O
hair O
frying O
temperatures O
along O
with O
it O
. O
With O
the O
Wind O
Flower O
dryer O
I O
'm O
able O
to O
have O
a O
cooler O
temperature O
and O
impressively O
fast O
blowing O
capabilities O
. O
I O
have O
thick O
hard O
to O
dry O
hair O
and O
I O
can O
honestly O
say O
that O
I O
dried O
my O
hair O
faster O
than O
I O
ever O
have O
with O
other O
dryers O
. O
It O
's O
light O
weight O
so O
my O
arm O
did O
n't O
get O
tired O
using O
it O
which O
is O
also O
great O
. O
I O
received O
this O
with O
a O
promotional O
discount O
however O
my O
reviews O
are O
honest O
and O
unbiased O
. O

Pleased O
with O
packaging O
and O
shipping O
. O
Pleased O
with O
product O
. O
Its O
better O
than O
our O
other O
brands O
and O
love O
how O
fast O
it O
dries O
my O
hair O
and O
leaves O
it O
less O
frizzy O
. O

This O
hair O
dryer O
performs O
as O
expected O
. O
  O
I O
have O
dry O
/ O
damaged O
hair O
due O
to O
chemo O
2 O
years O
ago O
. O
  O
I O
have O
never O
owned O
a O
hair O
dryer O
and O
thought O
that O
maybe O
blow O
drying O
my O
hair O
with O
a O
diffuser O
to O
increase O
wave O
/ O
curl O
would O
make O
it O
look O
better O
but O
it O
did O
n't O
. O
  O
However O
this O
is O
not O
due O
to O
the O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
The O
hair O
dryer O
is O
light O
, O
was O
very O
easy O
to O
operate O
and O
try O
different O
hair O
styles O
with O
especially O
since O
it O
includes O
both O
a O
diffuser O
and O
a O
concentrator O
. O
I O
tried O
at O
least O
10 O
different O
hair O
styles O
with O
this O
thing O
and O
found O
it O
super O
easy O
to O
adjust O
and O
operate O
. O
  O
Feature O
I O
love O
the O
most O
: O
adjustable O
heat O
setting O
. O
  O
I O
use O
the O
warm O
instead O
of O
hot O
and O
I O
can O
put O
the O
fan O
on O
low O
or O
high O
depending O
on O
how O
fast O
I O
want O
it O
. O
  O
Great O
dryer O
for O
the O
price O
but O
also O
for O
all O
of O
the O
features O
. O

I O
've O
used O
this O
dryer O
for O
over O
a O
year O
now O
and O
I O
think O
it O
works O
really O
well O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
find O
any O
difference O
between O
this O
dryer O
and O
normal O
dryer O
but O
it O
blow O
dries O
  O
my O
hair O
really O
quickly O
and O
has O
options O
for O
cold O
and O
hot O
air O
. O

Noisy O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
see O
anything O
professional O
about O
this O
dryer O
. O

This O
is O
one O
powerful O
hair O
dryer O
. O
The O
heat O
can O
be O
controlled O
along O
with O
the O
height O
and O
hood O
position O
. O

Great O

THIS O
ISTHE O
BEST O
  O
DRYER O
I O
HAVE O
EVER O
USED O

I O
was O
skeptical O
to O
think O
that O
an O
expensive O
hair O
dryer O
could O
be O
better O
than O
my O
basic O
, O
cheapie O
Conair O
I O
had O
been O
using O
, O
but O
it O
totally O
works O
! O
  O
It O
's O
alot O
heavier O
than O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
but O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
hold O
it O
as O
long O
because O
my O
hair O
actually O
dried O
faster O
. O
  O
I O
got O
lured O
in O
by O
the O
coupon O
but O
it O
was O
still O
alot O
to O
spend O
. O
  O
My O
hair O
was O
healthier O
, O
indeed O
shinier O
and O
less O
frizzy O
after O
blow O
- O
drying O
. O
  O
I O
was O
n't O
exactly O
sure O
how O
to O
use O
all O
the O
nozzle O
attachments O
and O
when O
to O
use O
which O
for O
what O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
still O
experimenting O
. O

Love O
this O
dryer O
the O
best O
that O
I O
have O
found O
so O
far O
. O

Pro O
: O
  O
lightweight O
, O
good O
power O
, O
less O
frizziesCon O
: O
  O
have O
to O
unplug O
nightlight O
in O
bathroom O
to O
accommodate O
the O
large O
GFC O
plug O
of O
dryer O

Works O
great O
! O
! O
Dries O
my O
hair O
quickly O
and O
stores O
beautifully O
with O
the O
retractable O
cord O
and O
folding O
handle O
! O
! O
So O
glad O
I O
got O
it O
; O
) O

It O
is O
heavier O
than O
expected O
and O
does O
n't O
feel O
balanced O
in O
my O
hand O
. O
  O
The O
opening O
and O
attachments O
are O
smaller O
than O
our O
previous O
Remington O
, O
which O
is O
what O
I O
was O
trying O
to O
replace O
. O
  O
It O
is O
okay O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
I O
would O
buy O
the O
same O
model O
again O
. O

Good O

I O
was O
iffy O
after O
I O
ordered O
this O
product O
with O
all O
the O
horrible O
things O
that O
were O
said O
about O
it O
, O
but O
I O
really O
like O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
I O
only O
use O
the O
cold O
settings O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
in O
general O
. O
  O
I O
am O
already O
using O
it O
for O
a O
few O
months O
and O
I O
love O
it O
. O
  O
Do O
n't O
depend O
on O
what O
people O
have O
to O
say O
unless O
you O
try O
it O
. O
  O
Unless O
of O
course O
it O
is O
all O
bad O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
hair O
dryer O
at O
a O
great O
price O
. O
  O
My O
wife O
already O
had O
this O
one O
and O
has O
been O
using O
it O
for O
several O
years O
.. O
So O
when O
my O
other O
brand O
hair O
dryer O
died O
, O
I O
bought O
this O
one O
and O
so O
far O
so O
good O
. O
  O
I O
have O
been O
using O
it O
for O
about O
3 O
months O
now O
. O

Works O
great O

The O
picture O
of O
the O
product O
is O
deceptive O
. O
I O
bought O
it O
on O
Amazon O
and O
what O
I O
received O
was O
a O
very O
cheap O
looking O
product O
. O
The O
instructions O
on O
how O
to O
hang O
it O
on O
the O
wall O
is O
also O
very O
confusing O
. O
I O
am O
concerned O
about O
the O
safety O
of O
this O
product O
so O
I O
have O
stopped O
using O
it O
. O
Now O
I O
am O
left O
with O
a O
cheap O
dryer O
that O
I O
am O
never O
going O
to O
use O
. O
I O
wish O
I O
can O
return O
it O
back O
without O
paying O
a O
ton O
on O
shipping O
. O

Very O
powerful O
for O
a O
small O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
Bought O
this O
solely O
to O
use O
when O
I O
travel O
, O
because O
not O
all O
places O
provide O
a O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
But O
the O
places O
that O
do O
provide O
a O
hair O
dryer O
, O
the O
quality O
is O
poor O
. O
  O
So O
... O
bought O
one O
for O
myself O
and O
love O
it O
! O
  O
Especially O
the O
pink O
color O
and O
small O
little O
zebra O
print O
carrying O
case O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
hair O
dryer O
- O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
designed O
well O
. O
It O
's O
definitely O
pretty O
- O
does O
n't O
take O
up O
too O
much O
space O
. O
It O
has O
all O
the O
features O
that O
I O
need O
, O
like O
multiple O
heat O
settings O
, O
multiple O
air O
flow O
settings O
and O
even O
a O
cool O
blast O
to O
set O
the O
style O
. O
It O
fits O
standard O
hair O
dryer O
attachments O
too O
- O
  O
like O
a O
diffuser O
. O
It O
also O
comes O
with O
the O
attachment O
that O
focuses O
the O
air O
blast O
- O
I O
think O
it O
's O
called O
the O
nozzle O
, O
but O
it O
's O
key O
to O
minimizing O
damage O
on O
your O
hair O
. O
My O
last O
hair O
dryer O
( O
from O
a O
different O
brand O
) O
was O
closer O
to O
$ O
65 O
and O
although O
it O
worked O
great O
, O
it O
started O
to O
breakdown O
within O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
. O
It O
finally O
cracked O
it O
half O
in O
my O
checked O
bag O
during O
a O
recent O
flight O
. O
The O
price O
was O
right O
for O
this O
dryer O
- O
and O
I O
love O
the O
customer O
- O
centric O
focus O
of O
the O
company O
, O
xtava O
. O
I O
also O
love O
the O
follow O
up O
communication O
I O
received O
after O
buying O
this O
- O
tips O
for O
how O
to O
use O
it O
well O
, O
contact O
info O
if O
I O
have O
any O
problems O
. O
So O
, O
I O
'm O
happy O
with O
the O
dryer O
, O
but O
communication O
from O
xtava O
has O
been O
really O
great O
- O
the O
next O
time O
I O
'm O
in O
the O
market O
to O
buy O
something O
like O
this O
, O
I O
'll O
check O
xtava O
first O
. O

I O
love O
my O
Andis O
Ceramic O
blow O
dryer O
. O
Not O
only O
does O
it O
get O
our O
hair O
dry O
quickly O
but O
it O
also O
straightens O
at O
the O
Sam O
's O
time O
. O
Ca O
n't O
get O
no O
better O
for O
me O
and O
my O
family O
. O
Quick O
and O
easy O
! O

The O
best O
hair O
dryer O
I O
ever O
used O
! O
! O

Very O
light O
weight O
, O
easy O
to O
use O
with O
one O
hand O
as O
you O
round O
brush O
with O
the O
other O
... O
and O
overall O
was O
above O
my O
expectations O
! O

Love O
this O
hairdryer O
! O
So O
fast O
and O
light O
. O
Cut O
styling O
time O
in O
half O

This O
is O
the O
best O
blow O
dryer O
I O
ever O
purchased O
. O
I O
have O
very O
thick O
long O
hair O
. O
With O
this O
dryer O
it O
dried O
in O
no O
time O

wonderful O
hair O
dryer O
and O
at O
a O
good O
price O

Great O
hair O
dryer O

Works O
great O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
. O
Broke O
. O
Decided O
to O
give O
a O
second O
chance O
because O
I O
loved O
how O
compact O
it O
is O
and O
it O
is O
off O
counter O
. O
I O
have O
had O
a O
new O
one O
for O
4 O
mos O
now O
and O
my O
2nd O
one O
broke O
. O
Says O
I O
can O
not O
return O
so O
now O
I O
am O
out O
2 O
dryers O
and O
spent O
over O
$ O
70 O
- O
will O
never O
buy O
another O
one O
. O
Terrible O
product O

For O
the O
price O
, O
this O
hair O
buyer O
is O
wonderful O
. O
My O
hair O
is O
seriously O
prone O
to O
being O
frizzy O
, O
and O
with O
( O
1 O
) O
being O
tourmaline O
ceramic O
, O
( O
2 O
) O
having O
a O
warm O
setting O
as O
well O
as O
a O
cool O
and O
hot O
, O
and O
( O
3 O
) O
having O
a O
concentrator O
, O
my O
hair O
has O
started O
acting O
much O
better O
. O
It O
's O
also O
fairly O
quiet O
. O
The O
lack O
of O
five O
stars O
is O
because O
it O
is O
n't O
particularly O
easy O
to O
store O
; O
it O
barely O
fits O
in O
the O
normal O
- O
size O
drawer O
, O
and O
including O
the O
diffuser O
, O
concentrator O
, O
and O
a O
hairbrush O
, O
it O
can O
be O
challenging O
to O
fit O
it O
in O
the O
drawer O
. O
Definitely O
a O
wonderful O
buy O
, O
though O
. O

TY O

excellent O

I O
used O
amazon O
prime O
and O
got O
this O
pretty O
fast O
. O
I O
have O
n't O
used O
it O
as O
yet O
but O
I O
did O
test O
the O
item O
and O
it O
works O
seemingly O
well O
... O
The O
barrel O
of O
the O
blowdryer O
works O
pretty O
well O
and O
the O
force O
of O
the O
air O
blown O
was O
great O
. O
However O
while O
inspecting O
this O
item O
it O
has O
scuff O
marks O
on O
the O
concentrator O
as O
if O
it O
had O
been O
used O
before O
or O
before O
being O
shipped O
. O
Not O
sure O
if O
it O
will O
lessen O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
force O
of O
the O
air O
over O
a O
period O
of O
time O
but O
we O
'll O
see O
. O
Also O
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
dryer O
there O
was O
a O
removable O
backing O
that O
allows O
for O
cleaning O
if O
the O
air O
vent O
gets O
clog O
, O
which O
I O
did O
n't O
expect O
and O
it O
was O
a O
pleasant O
supprise O
. O
The O
concentrator O
also O
takes O
quite O
a O
bit O
of O
strength O
to O
put O
on O
. O
( O
Twisting O
it O
on O
does O
n't O
make O
much O
sense O
so O
I O
'd O
recommend O
lining O
it O
up O
and O
the O
pushing O
it O
down O
on O
the O
barrel) O
... O
My O
intial O
review O
however O
is O
4stars O
. O
I O
will O
be O
doing O
an O
update O
within O
the O
next O
month O
.. O

I O
'm O
profesional O
hairstylist O
and O
i O
love O
it O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
hair O
dryer O
several O
years O
ago O
and O
really O
loved O
it O
, O
so O
when O
it O
stopped O
working O
recently O
due O
to O
a O
loose O
connection O
in O
the O
GFCI O
plug O
I O
knew O
I O
had O
to O
purchase O
it O
again O
. O
  O
The O
retractable O
cord O
is O
just O
brilliant O
-- O
every O
hair O
dryer O
should O
have O
this O
feature O
. O
  O
The O
cool O
shot O
button O
is O
handy O
to O
help O
set O
your O
style O
. O
  O
And O
the O
diffuser O
attachment O
is O
just O
* O
fabulous O
* O
, O
with O
air O
being O
directed O
in O
and O
through O
the O
prongs O
as O
well O
as O
around O
them O
to O
provide O
more O
even O
heat O
and O
air O
distribution O
. O
  O
I O
am O
so O
glad O
Conair O
is O
still O
making O
this O
model O
and O
that O
Amazon O
carries O
it O
. O

Powerful O
! O

It O
certainly O
works O
okay O
, O
but O
! O
It O
's O
very O
big O
, O
it O
's O
quite O
heavy O
and O
you O
'll O
need O
to O
have O
a O
good O
memory O
to O
remember O
all O
of O
the O
functions O
. O
I O
would O
say O
this O
one O
has O
been O
Over O
Engineered O
in O
the O
extreme O
and O
I O
'm O
sure O
as O
I O
will O
, O
many O
will O
go O
back O
to O
their O
lighter O
and O
simpler O
to O
use O
unit O
. O
A O
speed O
, O
cool O
and O
perhaps O
two O
or O
three O
heat O
settings O
are O
I O
'm O
sure O
is O
what O
most O
of O
us O
need O
and O
want O
and O
I O
feel O
this O
baby O
has O
just O
got O
too O
many O
functions O
to O
be O
practical O
. O
Luckily O
, O
I O
purchased O
this O
on O
a O
very O
special O
Amazon O
Deal O
, O
but O
truthfully O
I O
will O
just O
keep O
this O
one O
as O
a O
spare O
. O

Handy O
little O
blowdryer O
, O
better O
than O

  O
It O
is O
too O
bright O
for O

I O
love O
the O

plenty O
of O
room O

Wife O

. O

Phenomenal O
product O

Great O

travel O
. O
  O
And O
does O
a O
nice O
job O
styling O
hair O
. O

Excellent O
and O
very O
durable O
hairdryer O
. O
This O
is O
a O
heavy O
quality O
dryer O
; O
no O
cheap O
light O
- O
weight O
plastic O
here O
. O
Comes O
with O
2 O
attachments O
. O
Would O
be O
nice O
if O
it O
came O
with O
a O
retractable O
cord O
, O
but O
money O
well O
spent O
nonetheless O
. O

It O
works O
as O
it O
should O
be O
working O

I O
want O
to O
  O
return O
this O
because O
it O
does O
not O
have O
a O
plug O
. O

It O
is O
a O
little O
heavier O
than O
most O
hair O
dryers O
I O
have O
had O
. O
I O
like O
the O
fact O
that O
high O
heat O
does O
not O
burn O
and O
it O
has O
very O
powerful O
air O
flow O
. O
  O
Wish O
it O
wasa O
little O
lighter O
weight O
. O

It O
is O
n't O
the O
stronger O
dryer O
I O
have O
used O
, O
but O
it O
is O
very O
adequate O
and O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
handle O
. O
The O
shipping O
was O
quick O
and O
perfect O
. O
So O
If O
your O
dryer O
dies O
This O
was O
a O
great O
substitute O
! O
! O
Thank O
you O
. O

Great O
! O
Its O
light O
, O
efficient O
and O
has O
a O
super O
cute O
design O
. O
Its O
even O
easier O
to O
use O
than O
my O
mom O
's O
expensive O
hair O
dryer O
. O

Yes O
it O
works O
great O

Spectacular O
, O
light O
- O
weight O
, O
compact O
and O
an O
outstanding O
price O
! O
  O
I O
purchased O
two O
! O
! O

ANOTHER O
BLOW O
DRYER O
THAT O
CAUSES O
FLYAWAY O
HAIR O
AND O
THE O
FRIZZIES O
! O
  O
I O
WISH O
SOMEONE O
KNEW O
OF O
A O
MINI O
DRYER O
THAT O
ACTUALLY O
STRAIGHTENS O
BANGS O
! O
  O
UNFORTUNATELY O
, O
THIS O
DRYER O
DOES O
NOT O
DO O
THE O
TRICK O
, O
I O
AM O
SORRY O
TO O
SAY O
! O

Burned O
out O
about O
4 O
months O
after O
I O
bought O
it O
. O
Total O
bummer O
. O
I O
have O
used O
Conait O
hair O
dryers O
for O
years O
and O
never O
had O
an O
issue O
before O
. O
This O
one O
was O
a O
bust O
:-( O

Low O
noise O
good O
hair O
dryer O

A O
little O
noisy O
, O
but O
powerful O
, O
small O
enough O
to O
pack O
. O
Cord O
is O
a O
bit O
on O
the O
short O
side O
, O
but O
it O
's O
perfect O
for O
my O
use O
. O

I O
like O
that O
this O
dryer O
provides O
greater O
heat O
than O
my O
1800 O
dryer O
, O
however O
it O
does O
n't O
put O
out O
as O
much O
power O
. O

Lasted O
only O
a O
few O
months O
before O
it O
died O
. O
Simply O
stopped O
working O
both O
the O
motor O
and O
the O
heating O
. O
During O
the O
time O
that O
it O
worked O
, O
average O
product O
. O
Not O
the O
best O
but O
not O
the O
worst O
. O

I O
had O
a O
Remington O
dryer O
before O
this O
that O
lasted O
5 O
years O
. O
I O
have O
thick O
, O
super O
long O
hair O
, O
so O
I O
needed O
something O
powerful O
that O
would O
n't O
leave O
my O
arms O
sore O
from O
an O
hour O
's O
worth O
of O
styling O
. O
My O
old O
hair O
dryer O
did O
the O
job O
in O
less O
than O
15 O
minutes O
- O
it O
was O
miraculous O
. O
The O
new O
line O
stinks O
, O
period O
. O
Instead O
of O
staying O
consistently O
hot O
, O
it O
cycles O
through O
heat O
settings O
( O
including O
cold O
) O
. O
The O
cord O
is O
also O
much O
shorter O
than O
before O
- O
a O
pain O
for O
tall O
women O
. O
The O
newest O
development O
with O
my O
dryer O
is O
sparks O
SHOOTING O
OUT O
from O
the O
dryer O
INTO O
my O
hair O
. O
Um O
, O
hello O
? O
! O
I O
've O
had O
this O
for O
8 O
months O
, O
and O
I O
use O
it O
anywhere O
from O
1 O
- O
3 O
times O
a O
week O
for O
20 O
minutes O
or O
less O
. O
Two O
stars O
because O
it O
is O
still O
fairly O
powerful O
, O
and O
drying O
time O
is O
n't O
insanely O
long O
. O
I O
want O
to O
love O
this O
dryer O
... O
I O
just O
wish O
the O
old O
version O
was O
still O
available O
. O

It O
is O
great O
I O
can O
dry O
my O
hair O
while O
I O
put O
on O
my O
makeup O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
find O
a O
blow O
dryer O
this O
would O
stay O
on O
without O
popping O
off O
. O
I O
went O
through O
about O
5 O
different O
ones O
. O

Just O
received O
, O
neither O
of O
the O
accessories O
would O
fit O
on O
the O
dryer O
. O
I O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
to O
anyone O
. O

Works O
fine O
. O

LoBe O
it O

works O
great O

Pleased O
with O
my O
new O
Conair O
hair O
dryer O
and O
the O
option O
for O
choices O
on O
level O
of O
drying O
. O
I O
am O
a O
little O
disappointed O
that O
occasionally O
the O
cord O
hangs O
up O
as O
it O
is O
retracting O
and O
is O
very O
difficult O
to O
start O
again O
. O

This O
works O
for O
me O
. O
I O
like O
a O
small O
hairdryer O
. O
It O
is O
plenty O
powerful O
and O
plenty O
pink O
! O

Great O
product O
! O

Worked O
perfect O
! O

Powerful O
and O
small O
. O
Like O
the O
compact O
convenience O
of O
it O
and O
am O
happy O
this O
dryer O
does O
n't O
take O
over O
my O
drawer O
space O
. O

exactly O
what O
I O
needed O
. O
love O
it O
. O

This O
is O
the O
best O
of O
hair O
dryer O
. O
Light O
weight O
, O
efficient O
, O
dual O
voltage O
and O
work O
fine O

I O
do O
n't O
believe O
the O
hair O
dryer O
is O
worth O
the O
price O
. O
All O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
it O
did O
not O
out O
perform O
my O
5 O
- O
year O
old O
, O
$ O
30 O
CONAIR O
that O
I O
purchased O
from O
Target O
. O

Good O
! O

Not O
as O
powerful O
as O
advertised O
. O
  O
Air O
force O
is O
weak O
. O
  O
For O
price O
you O
get O
what O
you O
get O
. O

i O
love O
my O
hair O
dryer O
. O
my O
hair O
does O
dry O
in O
less O
time O
. O

Works O
as O
well O
as O
more O
expensive O
products O
of O
similar O
type O
. O

I O
've O
owned O
and O
used O
this O
dryer O
daily O
for O
the O
last O
12 O
years O
. O
Works O
well O
on O
my O
wavy O
average O
thick O
hair O
. O
Its O
sturdy O
and O
dang O
near O
indestructible O
because O
its O
been O
dropped O
plenty O
of O
times O
. O
I O
've O
never O
considered O
getting O
a O
different O
one O
until O
recently O
, O
I O
think O
the O
motor O
is O
about O
to O
give O
up O
the O
ghost O
because O
it O
shoots O
out O
sparks O
( O
not O
to O
worry O
, O
I O
have O
not O
started O
on O
fire O
or O
lost O
any O
hair O
) O
but O
I O
am O
noticing O
more O
frizz O
than O
I O
have O
in O
the O
past O
. O
Only O
complaint O
is O
that O
the O
filter O
can O
not O
be O
completely O
removed O
to O
clean O
it O
out O
( O
has O
a O
cover O
but O
it O
does O
n't O
really O
do O
much O
, O
lots O
of O
lint O
still O
gets O
in O
there O
) O
. O
We O
have O
to O
use O
a O
q O
- O
tip O
and O
canned O
air O
spray O
to O
try O
and O
remove O
the O
lint O
. O
I O
am O
going O
to O
upgrade O
and O
see O
what O
that O
gets O
me O
. O
Buying O
: O
  O
Will O
let O
you O
know O
how O
it O
compares O
in O
a O
week O
or O
so O
. O

As O
an O
international O
traveler O
, O
I O
love O
the O
Dual O
Voltage O
! O
! O

The O
heat O
did O
not O
last O
for O
long O
, O
just O
cold O
air O
blows O
. O
  O
The O
dryer O
is O
stylish O
and O
the O
attachment O
does O
not O
fall O
off O
. O
  O
It O
is O
sad O
the O
heat O
stopped O
within O
a O
week O
. O

Dryer O
does O
not O
put O
out O
the O
heat O
as O
compared O
to O
the O
dryer O
it O
is O
replacing O
. O
  O
Blows O
strong O
but O
not O
hot O
enough O
. O
  O
The O
$ O
20 O
Conair O
at O
Costco O
puts O
out O
more O
heat O
than O
this O
product O
. O

This O
gives O
one O
choice O
of O
heat O
and O
power O
. O
It O
is O
fast O
and O
nice O

The O
locking O
mechanism O
on O
the O
hose O
is O
not O
stable O
enough O
to O
hold O
the O
hose O
securely O
. O
If O
I O
make O
a O
sudden O
move O
the O
hose O
pops O
off O

When O
this O
arrived O
i O
did O
n't O
even O
open O
it O
for O
a O
couple O
weeks O
, O
but O
as O
soon O
as O
i O
went O
to O
use O
it O
, O
it O
only O
blows O
cold O
air O
! O

Very O
light O
, O
fries O
my O
hair O
quickly O
. O
Like O
the O
cool O
button O
. O

Love O
it O
. O
Works O
great O
does O
nt O
over O
heat O
! O
Perfect O
buy O
! O

A O
couple O
of O
things O
to O
think O
about O
before O
buying O
this O
dryer O
. O
First O
, O
the O
cord O
is O
pretty O
short O
. O
It O
's O
about O
3 O
feet O
, O
and O
1/3 O
of O
it O
does O
not O
retract O
( O
by O
design O
) O
; O
so O
, O
about O
a O
foot O
of O
the O
cord O
hanging O
even O
when O
you O
are O
not O
using O
the O
dryer O
. O
Second O
, O
the O
there O
's O
no O
temperature O
setting O
, O
and O
the O
temperature O
is O
very O
low O
. O
If O
you O
have O
long O
hair O
, O
it O
takes O
a O
long O
time O
to O
dry O
it O
. O
For O
the O
price O
, O
this O
dryer O
is O
not O
bad O
, O
but O
for O
these O
reasons O
, O
I O
bought O
a O
different O
dryer O
. O
This O
dryer O
is O
now O
in O
the O
guess O
bathroom O
. O

I O
liked O
the O
hair O
dryer O
it O
. O
It O
is O
like O
the O
ones O
at O
the O
hair O
salon O
. O

My O
only O
complaint O
is O
that O
the O
extension O
does O
not O
clip O
on O
. O
Whenever O
I O
put O
the O
dryer O
away O
, O
the O
piece O
falls O
off O
and O
I O
have O
to O
go O
fishing O
for O
it O
. O
Other O
than O
that O
, O
it O
is O
light O
weight O
and O
cuts O
dry O
time O
. O
The O
highest O
heat O
setting O
is O
HOT O
. O

Love O
this O
blow O
dryer O
. O
  O
Hair O
so O
much O
easier O
to O
manage O
with O
this O
dryer O
than O
my O
old O
that O
just O
got O
hot O
. O

I O
loved O
it O

Hi O
, O
would O
have O
given O
it O
a O
5 O
- O
star O
, O
as O
it O
worked O
really O
well O
and O
was O
powerful O
yet O
quiet O
. O
  O
Unfortunately O
, O
not O
even O
a O
year O
old O
and O
with O
no O
warning O
, O
one O
day O
the O
on O
/ O
off O
switch O
no O
longer O
flicked O
on O
and O
off O
( O
like O
a O
spring O
had O
broken O
inside O
or O
something O
) O
and O
I O
had O
to O
throw O
it O
away O
. O
  O
Also O
, O
the O
filter O
is O
not O
easily O
accessible O
, O
like O
with O
some O
hair O
dryers O
that O
have O
a O
trap O
door O
that O
opens O
so O
you O
can O
reach O
them O
. O
  O
The O
only O
way O
to O
clean O
the O
filter O
is O
trying O
to O
shove O
a O
paper O
clip O
or O
pipe O
cleaner O
in O
between O
the O
vent O
slots O
and O
see O
if O
you O
can O
somehow O
pick O
the O
hair O
/ O
dust O
out O
of O
the O
filter O
. O

I O
had O
bought O
this O
blow O
dryer O
in O
a O
convenient O
store O
and O
loved O
it O
! O
  O
I O
went O
back O
and O
purchased O
an O
extra O
one O
for O
my O
guest O
bathroom O
for O
company O
to O
use O
. O
  O
Our O
family O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
birthdays O
in O
March O
and O
I O
thought O
this O
would O
be O
a O
great O
gift O
for O
my O
daughters O
. O
  O
The O
convenient O
store O
did O
not O
have O
any O
of O
these O
left O
, O
so O
I O
went O
to O
my O
Trusty O
Amazon O
and O
bought O
two O
from O
them O
. O
All O
of O
our O
daughters O
have O
waist O
length O
to O
knee O
length O
hair O
and O
I O
have O
very O
thick O
and O
long O
hair O
and O
it O
takes O
us O
30 O
to O
45 O
mins O
with O
other O
dryers O
to O
dry O
our O
hair O
. O
  O
This O
blow O
dryer O
does O
my O
hair O
in O
15 O
mins O
. O
  O
I O
love O
this O
thing O
! O
! O
  O
We O
do O
n't O
understand O
how O
some O
say O
they O
get O
their O
long O
hair O
stuck O
at O
the O
intake O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
blow O
dryer O
because O
most O
women O
do O
not O
have O
knee O
length O
hair O
and O
we O
have O
never O
had O
this O
issue O
. O
  O
If O
you O
want O
a O
powerful O
blow O
dryer O
, O
this O
is O
the O
one O
for O
you O
.. O

Nice O
hairdryer O
. O
Simple O
and O
solid O
. O
I O
use O
mine O
for O
drying O
off O
my O
goldendoodle O
when O
she O
's O
been O
out O
in O
the O
rain O
. O

I O
really O
like O
it O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
reasons O
. O
The O
size O
and O
also O
the O
blower O
, O
it O
is O
the O
best O
I O
have O
ever O
used O
. O
One O
problem O
, O
I O
had O
one O
before O
this O
order O
and O
it O
only O
lasted O
a O
year O
. O

Great O
seller O
and O
great O
product O
, O
this O
hair O
dryer O
is O
manageable O
and O
leaves O
my O
hair O
perfect O
. O
The O
drier O
is O
a O
bit O
heavy O
but O
other O
than O
that O
, O
perfect O
size O
and O
it O
makes O
wonders O

great O
for O
the O
guest O
room O

Works O
really O
well O
, O
and O
fun O
colors O

For O
commercial O
setting O
they O
are O
neat O
and O
clean O
but O
with O
heavy O
everyday O
use O
they O
get O
about O
1 O
- O
1.5 O
years O
before O
burning O
out O
. O
Very O
happy O
with O
the O
product O
and O
would O
recommend O
them O
to O
other O
businesses O
. O
I O
will O
be O
purchasing O
more O
in O
the O
future O
! O

The O
hairdryer O
was O
good O
while O
it O
lasted O
but O
has O
now O
burnt O
out O
. O
Dead O
in O
under O
two O
years O
. O
I O
bought O
it O
for O
$ O
26.75 O
two O
years O
ago O
on O
Amazon O
Prime O
and O
now O
it O
seems O
tripple O
the O
price O
! O
How O
is O
that O
even O
possible O
? O

Great O
product O
! O

Excellent O
hair O
dryer O
. O
I O
love O
it O
because O
I O
can O
get O
very O
high O
heat O
on O
a O
low O
or O
high O
blow O
setting O
. O
Also O
it O
cools O
down O
quickly O
on O
the O
cool O
air O
setting O
to O
lock O
in O
styles O
. O
Just O
enough O
blow O
power O
and O
plenty O
of O
choices O
for O
temp O
and O
speed O
. O
Easy O
to O
handle O
. O

Works O
well O
, O
used O
for O
a O
whole O
2 O
hours O
to O
dry O
some O
stuff O
. O

Received O
a O
replacement O
for O
this O
one O
that O
exploded O
about O
4 O
- O
6 O
months O
ago O
and O
that O
also O
blew O
up O
yesterday O
.... O
if O
you O
use O
a O
hairdryer O
every O
day O
this O
is O
not O
the O
one O
for O
you O
. O
It O
would O
stop O
half O
way O
through O
drying O
( O
and O
it O
takes O
less O
then O
ten O
minutes O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
) O
and O
I O
would O
have O
to O
let O
it O
cool O
off O
before O
it O
would O
restart O
. O
Glad O
I O
never O
mounted O
it O
. O

Just O
what O
I O
was O
wanting O
! O
! O
! O

Work O
really O
nice O
is O
awesome O
. O
..... O

I O
bought O
this O
exact O
hairdryer O
more O
than O
5 O
years O
ago O
and O
I O
had O
to O
buy O
it O
again O
. O
It O
's O
efficient O
and O
travels O
well O
! O

I O
wish O
I O
had O
this O
dryer O
forever O
! O

Love O
, O
love O
, O
love O
it O
! O
! O
! O
Very O
comfortable O
to O
use O
, O
controls O
in O
the O
right O
spot O
and O
dries O
my O
hair O
quickly O
and O
leaves O
it O
smooth O
and O
shiny O
! O
! O
! O
VERY O
happy O
! O
! O
! O
And O
it O
has O
sparkles O
... O
:D O

I O
have O
always O
had O
excellent O
luck O
with O
Conair O
hair O
dryers O
. O
  O
My O
previous O
one O
lasted O
over O
five O
years O
! O
  O
I O
have O
been O
using O
this O
one O
for O
a O
week O
so O
far O
and O
I O
love O
it O
. O
  O
It O
is O
lightweight O
and O
dries O
your O
hair O
quickly O
( O
without O
making O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
are O
going O
through O
a O
wind O
tunnel O
) O
. O
  O
It O
is O
a O
little O
smaller O
than O
my O
old O
dryer O
, O
so O
it O
would O
also O
be O
useful O
for O
travel O
. O
  O
Very O
nice O
. O

The O
dryer O
works O
great O
. O
  O
The O
only O
reason O
for O
not O
5 O
stars O
is O
the O
cord O
retraction O
. O
  O
It O
sometimes O
takes O
three O
times O
to O
get O
the O
cord O
to O
retract O
fully O
. O

EXCELLENT O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
tiny O
size O
for O
traveling O
, O
but O
I O
returned O
it O
because O
it O
does O
not O
have O
a O
cool O
shot O
button O
. O

Really O
nice O
product O
, O
but O
some O
times O
the O
cord O
retainer O
button O
not O
working O
properly O

I O
bought O
this O
because O
my O
older O
Conair O
caught O
on O
fire O
one O
morning O
, O
after O
about O
6 O
years O
of O
use O
. O
I O
needed O
something O
quick O
and O
inexpensive O
. O
That O
is O
what O
this O
is O
. O
The O
diffuser O
is O
not O
well O
conceived O
, O
the O
directional O
is O
poorly O
done O
. O
The O
airflow O
is O
slow O
, O
and O
the O
dryer O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
get O
hot O
enough O
. O
This O
worked O
well O
enough O
in O
a O
pinch O
, O
but O
is O
not O
my O
recommended O
choice O
for O
everyday O
use O
. O

Very O
nice O
. O
I O
love O
the O
different O
heat O
settings O
and O
the O
noise O
level O
is O
really O
low O
compared O
to O
my O
old O
Conair O
hair O
dryer O

It O
is O
tiny O
and O
lightweight O
but O
very O
powerful O
. O
It O
is O
perfect O
for O
travel O
. O

Does O
n't O
over O
dry O
my O
hair O
! O
  O
Love O
it O
! O

The O
only O
reason O
why O
I O
bought O
this O
blow O
dryer O
was O
that O
my O
other O
hair O
dryer O
gave O
out O
on O
me O
and O
due O
highly O
to O
the O
reviews O
. O
  O
The O
positive O
reviews O
were O
right O
on O
with O
the O
product O
. O
  O
I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
product O
to O
the O
3 O
settings O
for O
your O
hair O
and O
the O
add O
- O
on O
. O

Momma O
loved O
it O
:) O

This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
light O
weight O
and O
works O
awesome O
! O
I O
love O
the O
multiple O
settings O
and O
the O
size O
for O
travel O
. O
So O
far O
no O
issues O
. O

Great O
little O
Hair O
Dryer O

It O
quickly O
dries O

! O

I O

good O
working O
and O
I O
like O
me O
hear O
after O
the O
ions O

Excellent O
, O
but O
noisier O
than O
I O
thought O
. O

Best O
hairdryer O
I O
've O
ever O
had O
, O
love O
the O
ease O
of O
cord O
retraction O
. O

Great O
product O
! O
The O
only O
bad O
thing O
was O
that O
the O
wheels O
did O
n't O
fit O
. O

Works O
fine O
, O
I O
just O
wish O
there O
was O
a O
cool O
setting O
for O
those O
hot O
days O
you O
have O
to O
blow O
dry O
your O
hair O
. O
It O
also O
seems O
like O
it O
does O
n't O
get O
as O
hot O
as O
my O
other O
hair O
dryer O
this O
size O
. O

This O
works O
great O
. O
We O
've O
had O

years O
now O
and O

$ O
20 O
on O
Amazon O
( O
sale O

  O
Nice O
and O
quiet O

to O
the O
one O
my O
wife O
used O
to O
use O
. O
  O
I O
'm O
surprised O
more O
women O
do O
n't O
have O
hearing O
loss O
from O
all O
the O
noise O
of O

things O
. O

Gets O
my O
hair O
dry O
. O
Folds O
up O
neatly O
. O
But O
it O
did O
n't O
do O
anything O

special O
to O
my O
hair O
. O
It O
's O
a O
hair O

. O
It O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
n O
fits O
in O
my O
luggage O
. O
So O
it O
does O
what O
it O
's O
supposed O
to O
do O
. O

Lots O
of O
power O
, O
works O
great O
, O
hair O
does O
n't O
seem O
as O
dry O
after O
using O
. O
  O
Would O
definitely O
buy O
again O
. O

The O
heat O
setting O
is O
only O
two O
it O
said O

  O
I O
have O
curly O
hair O
and O
have O
found O
that O
the O
diffuser O
that O
comes O
with O
it O
is O
the O
best O
for O
making O
my O
hair O
have O
the O
best O
curls O
. O
  O
I O
had O
actually O
purchased O

hair O
dryers O
( O
one O
specifically O
for O
curly O
hair O
) O
and O
they O
did O
n't O
work O
at O
all O

  O
Not O

blow O
my O

all O
around O
when O

the O

professional O
and O
have O
used O
this O
dryer O
daily O
for O
years O
. O
Mine O
recently O
died O
so O
bought O
another O
one O
. O
Reasonable O
price O
too O
. O

excellent O
: O
compact O
and O
very O
powerful O
. O

dries O
your O
hair O
very O
quickly O
, O
I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
product O

Seems O
to O
work O
okay O
. O
I O
have O
n't O
really O
had O
the O
chance O
to O
try O
it O
out O
yet O
. O
I O
pulled O
it O
out O
of O
the O
box O
and O
tested O
it O
, O
so O
for O
now O
its O
okay O
. O
The O
hair O
dryer O
and O
attachments O
are O
much O
smaller O
than O
I O
imagined O
. O
Its O
a O
normal O
size O
hair O
dryer O
, O
however O
I O
'm O
used O
to O
a O
much O
bigger O
one O
by O
Revlon O
. O
Hopefully O
this O
one O
matches O
up O
well O
to O
the O
standards O
of O
the O
Revlon O
products O
. O
I O
figured O
I O
could O
n't O
beat O
the O
price O
.... O

Good O

good O
buy O
for O
the O
money O
. O
  O
Works O
perfectly O
. O

It O
's O
ok O
but O
I O
was O
expecting O
it O
to O
have O
more O
power O
. O
Very O
expensive O
and O
same O
power O
as O
the O
previos O
model O
. O
I O
kept O
it O
because O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
time O
to O
shop O
around O
, O
otherwise O
, O
it O
would O
had O
gone O
back O
. O

This O
hair O
dryer O
worked O
perfectly O
on O
my O
recent O
trip O
to O
Holland O
, O
Belgium O
, O
France O
, O
and O
England O
. O
  O
There O
was O
no O
converter O
needed O
, O
just O
an O
outlet O
adapter O
when O
switched O
on O
the O
250 O
V O
mode O
and O
used O
only O
on O
the O
low O
setting O
. O
  O
To O
clarify O
, O
you O
can O
ONLY O
use O
it O
on O
the O
LOW O
setting O
, O
however O
on O
the O
low O
setting O
it O
runs O
like O
it O
is O
on O
high O
- O
very O
easy O
, O
and O
worked O
perfectly O
. O
  O
It O
is O
also O
extremely O
compact O
for O
easy O
packing O
, O
but O
still O
worked O
like O
a O
bigger O
, O
nice O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
Hope O
this O
helps O
someone O
:) O

Met O
my O
expectations O
. O

GIVEN O
AS O
A O
GIFT O
AT O
CHRISTMAS O
... O
AWESOME O
PRODUCT O
, O
MY O
SISTER O
LOVES O
IT O
AND O
SHE O
HAS O
EXTREMELY O
FRIZZY O
HAIR O
. O

I O
realized O
a O
bit O
too O
late O
in O
my O
adult O
life O
that O
a O
good O
blow O
- O
dryer O
makes O
all O
the O
difference O
in O
the O
look O
and O
feel O
of O
your O
hair O
. O
I O
simply O
could O
not O
figure O
out O
why O
my O
hair O
was O
always O
kind O
of O
sticky O
and O
not O
quite O
fully O
dry O
when O
I O
got O
out O
of O
the O
shower O
and O
tried O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
with O
my O
5 O
+ O
year O
old O
Conair O
that O
I O
bought O
at O
CVS O
very O
inexpensively O
. O
I O
did O
some O
research O
online O
and O
scoffed O
at O
the O
$ O
150 O
+ O
dryers O
that O
were O
being O
promoted O
. O
This O
one O
was O
on O
the O
list O
, O
and O
honestly O
, O
given O
the O
relatively O
lower O
price O
point O
versus O
the O
other O
professional O
dryers O
, O
I O
was O
willing O
to O
try O
it O
out O
. O
WOW O
. O
I O
have O
used O
it O
now O
about O
3 O
times O
, O
and O
it O
is O
hard O
to O
believe O
what O
a O
significant O
difference O
I O
see O
in O
my O
hair O
. O
I O
styled O
it O
myself O
for O
a O
formal O
Gala O
event O
, O
and O
was O
able O
to O
achieve O
the O
shiny O
look O
, O
feel O
, O
and O
volume O
in O
my O
hair O
that O
any O
professional O
stylist O
could O
achieve O
. O
It O
was O
unreal O
. O
Even O
on O
a O
work O
day O
I O
feel O
so O
much O
better O
about O
myself O
having O
simply O
styled O
my O
hair O
with O
this O
blow O
dryer O
. O
It O
targets O
the O
hot O
hair O
wonderfully O
and O
leaves O
my O
hair O
so O
dry O
, O
shiny O
and O
healthy O
. O
I O
went O
back O
and O
ordered O
one O
to O
send O
to O
my O
mom O
! O
She O
is O
also O
a O
victim O
of O
ignorance O
- O
to O
- O
bad O
- O
dryer O
- O
itis O
, O
so O
I O
went O
ahead O
and O
sent O
her O
the O
cure O
. O
Happy O
Drying O
! O

This O
hair O
dryer O
has O
a O
a O
short O
cord O
and O
you O
have O
to O
have O
it O
close O
too O
a O
plug O
. O
The O
other O
other O
issue O
is O
the O
on O
and O
off O
switch O
and O
the O
temperature O
level O
are O
too O
close O
to O
where O
you O
hold O
the O
dryer O
and O
the O
buttons O
switch O
on O
and O
off O
all O
the O
time O
. O
  O
It O
's O
hard O
to O
hold O
the O
dryer O
. O

I O
absolutely O
love O
it O

of O
air O
, O
love O
the O

the O
pattern O
is O
fun O
. O

Bonnet O
was O
very O
tight O
around O
the O
head O
. O
I O
took O
the O
elastic O
out O
and O
replaced O
it O
with O
some O
1/4 O
inch O
elastic O
material O
purchased O
from O
Walmart O
, O
taping O
it O
to O
some O
automotive O
wire O
and O
threading O
through O
the O
bonnet O
. O
Now O
my O
wife O
likes O
it O
very O
much O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
hair O
dryer O
after O
it O
was O
recommended O
by O
a O
friend O
. O
  O
I O
absolutely O
love O
it O
! O
  O
I O
have O
long O
hair O
and O
have O
never O
been O
able O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
as O
quickly O
as O
I O
can O
with O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
I O
ca O
n't O
say O
enough O
good O
things O
about O
it O
and O
highly O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
! O

We O
bought O
two O
wall O
mount O
hairdryers O
to O
install O
at O
a O
vacation O
rental O
. O
  O
They O
work O
well O
and O
are O
attractive O
. O
  O
They O
are O
small O
, O
do O
n't O
take O
up O
too O
much O
wall O
space O
and O
leaves O
the O
counter O
top O
clear O
. O
  O
It O
was O
a O
good O
choice O
for O
us O
. O

As O
a O
bald O
man O
, O
I O
love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
It O
helps O
my O
wife O
dry O
her O
hair O
in O
a O
fair O
amount O
of O
time O
, O
less O
than O
her O
previous O
hair O
dryer O
. O
Seems O
to O
work O
pretty O
good O
. O
Typically O
loud O
when O
on O
, O
so O
I O
leave O
the O
room O
. O
Also O
, O
of O
note O
, O
this O
hair O
dryer O
does O
not O
have O
an O
actual O
turbo O
despite O
the O
product O
description O
. O
I O
feel O
like O
this O
is O
either O
false O
advertising O
and O
I O
have O
been O
duped O
, O
or O
the O
seller O
has O
no O
idea O
what O
the O
hell O
a O
turbo O
actually O
is O
. O
Turbos O
are O
found O
on O
internal O
combustion O
engines O
, O
both O
gasoline O
and O
diesel O
. O
If O
' O
turbo O
' O
is O
meant O
to O
mean O
something O
like O
strong O
wind O
, O
they O
should O
have O
used O
a O
word O
like O
Kyufu O
, O
which O
is O
Japanese O
for O
strong O
wind O
. O
Or O
maybe O
the O
German O
word O
for O
hair O
dryer O
, O
which O
is O
fohn O
. O
Either O
way O
, O
do O
n't O
be O
fooled O
. O
There O
is O
no O
actual O
turbo O
, O
quiet O
fan O
and O
motor O
is O
subjective O
. O
It O
is O
loud O
. O
And O
I O
have O
not O
tested O
the O
lifeline O
shock O
protection O
. O
I O
would O
hope O
it O
works O
, O
but O
after O
the O
other O
misleading O
information O
, O
your O
results O
may O
vary O
. O

I O
m O
a O
hairstylist O
. O
I O
have O
2 O
of O
these O
. O
Super O
light O
and O
dries O
great O
. O
Not O
loud O
either O
! O

Compact O
and O
easy O
to O
use O

My O
daughter O
says O
that O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
use O
and O
is O
fine O
. O

Great O
purchase O
! O
Works O
perfectly O
. O

little O
bit O
heavier O
than O
expected O
. O

Love O
it O
.... O

I O
love O
my O
new O
Rusk O
! O
It O
is O
a O
little O
heavier O
than O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
, O
but O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
hold O
. O
The O
4 O
attachments O
make O
any O
style O
possible O
. O

The O
hair O
dryer O
is O
quiet O
and O
powerful O
enough O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
, O
however O
, O
the O
on O
/ O
off O
switch O
stopped O
working O
the O
first O
day O
. O
I O
did O
not O
want O
to O
go O
through O
taking O
it O
off O
the O
wall O
and O
send O
it O
back O
so O
I O
am O
using O
this O
item O
by O
plugging O
and O
unplugging O
the O
hair O
dryer O
as O
needed O
for O
use O
. O
The O
switch O
should O
last O
years O
, O
but O
did O
n't O
even O
work O
for O
one O
day O
. O

LOVE O
this O
hairdyer O
! O
! O
  O
Dries O
my O
hair O
in O
half O
the O
time O
, O
is O
so O
quiet O
and O
light O
in O
weight O
. O
  O
My O
girlfriend O
has O
owned O
this O
dryer O
for O
years O
and O
always O
has O
it O
with O
her O
when O
we O
travel O
together O
. O
  O
After O
our O
last O
vacation O
together O
I O
decided O
it O
was O
time O
I O
owned O
my O
own O
! O

So O
far O
used O
only O
one O
time O
, O
but O
I O
liked O
how O
it O
handled O
and O
it O
did O
a O
good O
job O
. O

I O
'm O
so O
glad O
that O
I O
finally O
got O
one O
of O
these O
for O
home O
. O
Works O
really O
well O
, O
not O
too O
loud O
and O
my O
hair O
does O
n't O
feel O
fried O
like O
a O
hand O
- O
dryer O
. O
My O
only O
suggestion O
is O
getting O
a O
weight O
to O
add O
to O
the O
base O
because O
it O
can O
tip O
over O
easier O
than O
it O
should O
. O

It O
made O
my O
hair O
very O
puffy O
... O
very O
, O
very O
, O
way O
too O
puffy O

Yes O
the O
blow O
dryer O
works O
well O
to O
dry O
my O
  O
hair O
, O
but O
it O
did O
n't O
leave O
my O
hair O
smooth O
without O
frizz O
. O
It O
was O
also O
awkward O
to O
handle O
, O
the O
nozzle O
is O
long O
. O
I O
will O
go O
back O
to O
my O
old O
hair O
dryer O
! O

Dry O
that O
hair O
for O
less O
than O
$ O
13 O
... O

This O
is O
a O
wonderful O
hair O
dryer O
. O
I O
would O
recommend O
to O
anyone O
. O

If O
you O
want O
it O
to O
de O
- O
frizz O
and O
smooth O
your O
hair O
and O
straighten O
it O
then O
it O
is O
a O
5 O
star O
purchase O
. O

well O
, O
it O
just O
did O
n't O
turn O
on O
after O
a O
year O
of O
use O
. O
it O
was O
n't O
dropped O
or O
near O
to O
a O
water O
or O
anything O
that O
might O
've O
caused O
it O
to O
malfunction O
. O
As O
i O
was O
getting O
ready O
for O
my O
day O
, O
it O
just O
did O
n't O
turn O
on O
. O
i O
tried O
to O
troubleshoot O
it O
, O
reset O
, O
use O
a O
different O
plug O
etc O
. O
no O
luck O

Awesome O
in O
perfect O
condition O
the O
box O
was O
a O
little O
beat O
up O
but O
the O
product O
is O
fantastic O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
sized O
hairdryer O
and O
has O
been O
working O
for O
about O
six O
months O
with O
daily O
use O
. O
My O
only O
complaint O
is O
I O
have O
thick O
hair O
so O
I O
wish O
it O
had O
a O
little O
more O
power O
and O
ran O
a O
little O
more O
hot O
like O
some O
of O
my O
other O
hair O
dryers O
. O

Very O
nice O
, O
compact O
, O
high O
quality O
dryer O
with O
good O
controls O
- O
a O
good O
value O
. O

Works O
well O
, O
good O
power O
, O
able O
to O
dry O
hair O
quickly O
. O

I O
love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
! O
I O
have O
long O
, O
natural O
hair O
. O
I O
used O
to O
blow O
dry O
and O
flat O
iron O
my O
hair O
until O
it O
started O
breaking O
and O
looking O
* O
dead O
* O
. O
I O
heard O
about O
this O
dryer O
on O
You O
Tube O
from O
Sista O
with O
Real O
Hair O
. O
I O
ordered O
and O
received O
it O
within O
3 O
- O
4 O
days O
. O
No O
more O
blow O
drying O
for O
me O
. O
Great O
Price O
too O
! O

When O
I O
touched O
the O
box O
I O
knew O
right O
then O
and O
there O
that O
something O
does O
n't O
feel O
right O
. O
It O
did O
n't O
feel O
like O
a O
brand O
new O
box O
and O
when O
I O
opened O
it O
up O
my O
suspicion O
was O
confirmed O
. O
I O
have O
received O
a O
used O
or O
return O
product O
when O
I O
paid O
for O
a O
new O
one O
. O
The O
hair O
dryer O
had O
marks O
on O
it O
from O
previous O
use O
. O
I O
'm O
not O
happy O
about O
this O
. O
  O
UPDATE O
: O
I O
decided O
to O
use O
it O
anyways O
but O
it O
would O
n't O
even O
work O
. O
I O
tried O
resetting O
and O
testing O
it O
but O
it O
wo O
n't O
even O
turn O
on O
. O
The O
buttons O
are O
very O
cheaply O
made O
. O
When O
I O
moved O
the O
buttons O
it O
felt O
like O
it O
would O
fall O
apart O
. O
Very O
disappointed O
. O

I O
use O
it O
daily O
. O
It O
's O
good O
and O
value O
for O
money O
. O

Do O
yourself O
a O
favor O
and O
buy O
this O
right O
now O
. O

It O
's O
a O
really O
good O
value O
for O
the O
money O
. O
  O
It O
is O
a O
bit O
heavier O
than O
I O
am O
used O
to O
and O
if O
just O
got O
s O
bit O
hotter O
it O
would O
be O
perfect O

This O
is O
the O
best O
compact O
hairdryer O
i O
ever O
purchased O
. O
So O
much O
power O
. O

A O
good O
piece O
of O
kit O
. O
I O
chose O
it O
for O
my O
wife O
she O
loves O
it O
. O
So O
powerful O
that O
she O
rarely O
uses O
it O
on O
full O
power O
( O
2 O
wiggles O
) O

I O
love O
this O
dryer O
. O
  O
I O
purchased O
about O
3 O
weeks O
ago O
and O
have O
used O
it O
almost O
every O
other O
day O
since O
I O
bought O
it O
. O
  O
It O
dries O
extremely O
fast O
in O
the O
morning O
so O
it O
allows O
me O
to O
not O
have O
to O
blow O
dry O
which O
is O
essential O
with O
African O
American O
hair O
and O
relaxers O
to O
prevent O
dryness O
. O
The O
settings O
are O
great O
and O
It O
is O
super O
quiet O
which O
is O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
. O
  O
Those O
are O
all O
definite O
positives O
. O
  O
However O
, O
I O
would O
have O
to O
agree O
with O
one O
of O
the O
other O
reviewers O
. O
  O
It O
is O
extremely O
top O
heavy O
and O
I O
had O
the O
same O
problem O
in O
that O
yesterday O
it O
fell O
over O
and O
the O
visor O
in O
the O
front O
broke O
. O
  O
Now O
I O
am O
hoping O
I O
can O
find O
someone O
that O
replaces O
the O
part O
as O
the O
part O
is O
screwed O
in O
and O
if O
that O
is O
the O
case O
then O
this O
would O
possibly O
increase O
my O
score O
a O
little O
but O
you O
still O
have O
the O
problem O
of O
it O
falling O
over O
in O
the O
future O
. O
  O
If O
I O
can O
not O
find O
a O
part O
to O
replace O
it O
online O
then O
I O
would O
drop O
this O
review O
to O
a O
2 O
or O
1 O
since O
it O
does O
n't O
work O
as O
well O
without O
the O
visor O
keeping O
the O
heat O
in O
. O

Nice O
hair O
dryer O
but O
very O
heavy O
. O

Ok O
.... O
It O
really O
dosent O
get O
that O
hot O
. O

Great O
hair O
dryer O
. O
no O
complaints O

This O
is O
great O
! O
! O
! O

It O
's O
really O
pretty O
and O
useful O
! O
The O
delivery O
is O
fast O
! O
Thanks O

The O
power O
of O
the O
dryer O
seems O
less O
than O
I O
would O
have O
thought O
. O
  O
Still O
nice O
. O

Great O
hair O
dryer O
! O
Shipping O
was O
very O
fast O
! O

Love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O

This O
blow O
dryer O
seemed O
to O
be O
just O
what O
I O
wanted O
, O
but O
was O
a O
huge O
disappointment O
. O
  O
It O
is O
very O
loud O
as O
I O
think O
one O
reviewer O
stated O
. O
  O
That O
I O
could O
deal O
with O
but O
that O
was O
just O
one O
small O
detail O
. O
  O
The O
attachment O
for O
the O
hair O
curling O
I O
could O
not O
work O
, O
although O
that O
may O
just O
be O
me O
. O
  O
The O
settings O
for O
the O
hot O
and O
cold O
on O
this O
are O
right O
at O
the O
finger O
tips O
where O
you O
hold O
the O
dryer O
. O
  O
Therefore O
, O
if O
you O
are O
not O
careful O
you O
will O
be O
drying O
on O
warm O
instead O
of O
high O
. O
  O
You O
start O
wondering O
why O
its O
not O
getting O
dry O
. O
  O
I O
have O
had O
to O
change O
it O
back O
as O
many O
as O
20 O
times O
in O
one O
hair O
drying O
session O
. O
  O
And O
now O
the O
last O
and O
& O
most O
frustrating O
feature O
of O
the O
dryer O
. O
  O
The O
concentrated O
hair O
drying O
attachment O
that O
was O
stated O
in O
the O
description O
of O
the O
product O
as O
coming O
off O
for O
easy O
cleaning O
, O
unlike O
most O
other O
models O
. O
  O
Well O
yes O
, O
it O
does O
come O
off O
for O
easy O
cleaning O
alright O
, O
it O
just O
blows O
it O
across O
the O
room O
as O
you O
are O
drying O
your O
hair O
. O
  O
You O
just O
do O
n't O
want O
anyone O
else O
in O
the O
room O
with O
you O
for O
you O
never O
know O
where O
the O
line O
of O
fire O
may O
be O
. O
  O
It O
blows O
off O
with O
quite O
a O
force O
so O
I O
am O
sure O
it O
would O
hurt O
someone O
, O
particularly O
a O
small O
child O
. O
  O
I O
owned O
a O
Vidal O
Sassoon O
Dryer O
before O
but O
never O
one O
like O
this O
. O
  O
I O
can O
not O
recommend O
this O
product O
and O
will O
not O
purchase O
another O
one O
of O
this O
brand O
. O
  O
It O
was O
inexpensive O
so O
I O
guess O
its O
true O
, O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
. O
  O
Not O
worth O
paying O
return O
shipping O
so O
I O
use O
it O
as O
it O
is O
until O
my O
new O
one O
arrives O
. O

Amazing O
dryer O
! O
! O
It O
has O
cut O
my O
drying O
time O
down O
significantly O
. O
I O
have O
really O
curly O
hair O
& O
this O
dryer O
works O
very O
well O
with O
my O
diffuser O
. O
I O
think O
it O
is O
a O
great O
value O
for O
the O
money O
and O
I O
'm O
so O
happy O
with O
my O
purchase O
! O

Very O
nice O
and O
easy O
to O
use O
. O
  O
Works O
great O
! O

So O
powerful O
and O
light O
, O
for O
that O
price O
it O
left O
behind O
all O
expensive O
Italian O
hairdryers O

the O
quality O
is O
very O
good O

Love O
this O
dryer O
especially O
the O
cool O
setting O
which O
I O
use O
for O
the O
first O
week O
after O
I O
color O
my O
hair O
. O
  O
It O
's O
lightweight O
and O
does O
n't O
make O
a O
lot O
of O
noise O
. O

Another O
device O
that O
is O
a O
powerhouse O
in O
a O
small O
package O
. O
  O
I O
had O
a O
very O
expensive O
white O
designer O
hairdresser O
before O
this O
and O
it O
still O
took O
forever O
to O
dry O
hair O
, O
and O
got O
so O
hot O
doing O
so O
that O
kids O
and O
pets O
yowl O
. O
  O
This O
dryer O
works O
in O
record O
time O
, O
blows O
the O
moisture O
out O
like O
those O
car O
dryer O
things O
at O
the O
car O
wash O
, O
and O
does O
n't O
burn O
hair O
or O
scalp O
doing O
so O
. O
  O
It O
is O
also O
fairly O
quiet O
for O
the O
power O
. O
  O
I O
am O
not O
a O
pro O
hairdresser O
so O
ca O
n't O
speak O
for O
that O
, O
but O
for O
the O
family O
bath O
night O
, O
it O
is O
fast O
without O
the O
  O
furious O
. O

Product O
arrived O
in O
perfect O
condition O
and O
have O
had O
no O
issues O
since O
it O
arrived O
. O
  O
It O
was O
packaged O
very O
sustainably O
and O
safely O
. O
Am O
very O
satisfied O
with O
customer O
service O
. O
  O
Totally O
worth O
the O
wait!My O
girlfriend O
absolutely O
loved O
this O
as O
a O
gift O
! O
She O
said O
the O
dryer O
is O
powerful O
enough O
but O
not O
hot O
enough O
to O
damage O
hair O
will O
leaving O
smooth O
hair O
and O
preventing O
split O
ends O
from O
fraying O
from O
the O
intense O
heat O
of O
a O
competitor O
. O
  O
If O
you O
have O
a O
significant O
other O
with O
delicate O
hair O
this O
is O
definitely O
worth O
the O
price O
and O
wait O
. O
  O
It O
will O
pay O
itself O
back O
in O
no O
time!I O
say O
it O
's O
worth O
the O
wait O
because O
you O
either O
have O
to O
save O
up O
enough O
money O
to O
purchase O
an O
item O
of O
this O
caliber O
and O
also O
because O
it O
is O
manufactured O
in O
Italy O
and O
takes O
about O
two O
weeks O
to O
arrive O

Great O
dryer O
. O
It O
dried O
my O
hair O
in O
under O
10 O
min O
. O
And O
I O
have O
thick O
hair O
that O
reaches O
my O
bum O
. O
Powerful O
, O
my O
leave O
your O
hair O
a O
little O
frizzed O
. O

Love O
having O
my O
hair O
dryer O
so O
handy O
. O

As O
a O
professional O
makeup O
artist O
and O
hair O
stylist O
I O
invest O
in O
a O
lot O
of O
products O
. O
This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
really O
not O
my O
favorite O
. O
I O
usually O
hold O
it O
by O
the O
base O
when O
I O
'm O
drying O
a O
client O
's O
hair O
but O
it O
gets O
so O
hot O
that O
I O
have O
to O
hold O
it O
by O
the O
handle O
, O
but O
when O
I O
do O
that O
I O
'm O
touching O
all O
the O
buttons O
and O
turning O
stuff O
on O
and O
off O
on O
accident O
. O
Also O
, O
the O
part O
that O
holds O
the O
filter O
on O
the O
back O
of O
the O
dryer O
keeps O
falling O
off O
that O
I O
had O
to O
tape O
it O
and O
now O
it O
looks O
terrible O
but O
it O
's O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
holds O
the O
piece O
on O
. O
Not O
to O
mention O
the O
metal O
grate O
on O
the O
back O
that O
holds O
the O
filter O
in O
keeps O
caving O
in O
constantly O
. O
I O
feel O
like O
these O
are O
not O
meant O
for O
travel O
, O
which O
is O
funny O
because O
it O
's O
travel O
size O
. O
Maybe O
I O
got O
a O
bad O
batch O
or O
something O
. O
Yes O
it O
's O
a O
powerful O
driver O
, O
but O
this O
seems O
more O
like O
it O
's O
aimed O
at O
a O
consumer O
than O
a O
professional O
which O
is O
sad O
because O
I O
had O
many O
professionals O
reccomend O
it O
to O
me O
. O
I O
would O
n't O
reccomend O
this O
to O
traveling O
stylists O
, O
but O
maybe O
it O
works O
better O
if O
you O
have O
your O
own O
station O
. O

good O
quality O
and O
lasts O
a O
long O
time O
... O

This O
hairdryer O
with O
the O
brush O
attachment O
works O
very O
well O
for O
drying O
and O
straightening O
out O
curly O
hair O
. O
A O
must O
for O
everyone O
with O
these O
extra O
curls O
! O
It O
's O
also O
quite O
nice O
to O
have O
the O
availability O
of O
the O
two O
currents O
that O
one O
might O
use O
built O
into O
this O
one O
unit O
. O
It O
will O
be O
great O
for O
traveling O
to O
Europe O
. O

Can O
a O
blow O
dryer O
be O
too O
powerful O
? O
.. O
the O
answer O
is O
yes O
.. O
it O
is O
very O
well O
made O
but O
it O
is O
so O
powerful O
if O
drys O
my O
hair O
so O
fast O
I O
ca O
n't O
style O
it O
with O
my O
round O
brush O
for O
a O
good O
blow O
out O
.. O
resulting O
in O
frizz O
that O
I O
have O
to O
correct O
with O
a O
flat O
iron O
.. O
this O
was O
on O
low O
setting O
.. O
the O
high O
setting O
might O
as O
well O
be O
a O
jet O
engine O
. O
. O
I O
'm O
keeping O
it O
to O
use O
on O
my O
poodle O
because O
she O
needs O
to O
be O
dryer O
quickly O
.. O
one O
major O
plus O
though O
it O
does O
not O
get O
very O
hot O
thus O
limiting O
the O
damage O
you O
will O
do O
. O

help O
my O

Also O

once O
with O
the O

No O

This O

that O
we O

and O
it O
lasted O
7 O
+ O
years O
. O
Ca O
n't O
ask O
for O
much O
more O
for O
a O
blow O
dryer O
in O
this O
price O
range O
. O

Cord O

So O
far O
so O
good O
. O
Very O
pleased O
at O
the O
price O
top O
! O

I O
bought O
this O
to O
replace O
my O
Conair O
Infinity O
Pro O
hairdryer O
. O
What O
attracted O
me O
to O
this O
Andis O
was O
the O
salon O
grade O
and O
the O
ionic O
/ O
ceramic O
attributes O
. O
Overall O
this O
is O
a O
good O
hair O
dryer O
, O
but O
it O
does O
n't O
blow O
as O
hard O
as O
the O
Conair O
it O
replaced O
. O
This O
was O
HUGE O
for O
me O
, O
as O
I O
like O
a O
good O
air O
flow O
. O
It O
takes O
longer O
for O
my O
wife O
to O
dry O
her O
hair O
because O
of O
it O
, O
so O
we O
went O
back O
to O
our O
old O
brand O
. O
It O
does O
, O
however O
, O
leave O
your O
hair O
silkier O
which O
was O
a O
surprise O
to O
me O
. O
I O
did O
n't O
think O
an O
ionic O
dryer O
could O
do O
that O
, O
but O
it O
does O
. O
The O
two O
settings O
it O
has O
for O
wattage O
did O
n't O
seem O
to O
make O
much O
of O
a O
difference O
, O
but O
it O
's O
a O
nice O
touch O
. O
I O
'm O
sure O
there O
's O
a O
reason O
for O
the O
option O
, O
but O
I O
ca O
n't O
think O
of O
anything O
it O
's O
useful O
for O
. O
I O
put O
it O
on O
the O
high O
setting O
and O
let O
it O
go O
. O
The O
retractable O
cord O
is O
nice O
, O
but O
it O
does O
n't O
reel O
the O
cord O
all O
the O
way O
in O
, O
leaving O
about O
16 O
in O
left O
dangling O
. O
After O
a O
few O
weeks O
of O
use O
, O
it O
reels O
in O
even O
less O
, O
now O
leaving O
about O
20 O
or O
so O
inches O
hanging O
. O
Pro O
: O
Silky O
hair O
, O
somewhat O
retractable O
cord O
, O
two O
wattage O
settings O
( O
that O
I O
'll O
prob O
never O
use).Con O
: O
Takes O
longer O
to O
dry O
long O
, O
thick O
hair O
as O
the O
air O
current O
is O
n't O
as O
strong O
as O
I O
'd O
like O
. O
I O
would O
n't O
buy O
this O
again O
or O
recommend O
it O
, O
but O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
mind O
a O
slightly O
weaker O
air O
flow O
, O
the O
ionic O
silkiness O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

Return O
is O
no O
longer O
needed O

It O
only O
has O
high O
and O
low O
modes O

or O
off O

For O
the O
price O
, O
the O
size O
, O
and O
options O
, O
it O
has O
dried O
my O
hair O
faster O
than O
that O
blue O
Conair O
from O
Target O
. O
My O
hair O
is O
dark O
black O
, O
thick O
in O
volume O
, O
and O
takes O
a O
long O
time O
to O
dry O
. O
You O
can O
ask O
all O
of O
my O
hairstylists O

So O
this O
one O
is O
great O
for O
your O
money O
. O

Nice O
velocity O

does O
n't O
get O
too O
hot O

  O
Cold O

good O

as O
described O

Did O
not O
like O
this O
at O
all O
. O
My O
hair O
took O
longer O

it O
was O
so O
loud O

LAST O
A O
VERY O
VERY O
LONG O
TIME O
. O
LOVE O
IT O
.. O
WOULD O
DEFINATELY O
BUY O
IT O
AGAIN O
IF O
I O
HAD O
TO O
. O

Love O
the O
air O
pressure O
on O
this O
dryer O
! O

I O
would O
have O
given O
this O
blow O
dryer O
a O
5 O
, O
but O
the O
cord O
needs O
to O
be O
longer O
. O
  O
Overall O
it O
works O
great O
though O
. O

This O
dryer O
was O
purchased O
last O
summer O
and O
safely O
stored O
while O
we O
moved O
. O
I O
pulled O
it O
out O
this O
January O
, O
and O
the O
low O
setting O
has O
already O
stopped O
working O
, O
while O
the O
high O
setting O
barely O
pushes O
out O
any O
air O
. O
  O
I O
'm O
now O
convinced O
this O
was O
a O
fake O
, O
and O
am O
sorely O
disappointed O
. O
Amazon O
is O
always O
our O
first O
stop O
for O
purchases O
such O
as O
these O
, O
and O
I O
've O
always O
been O
very O
happy O
with O
their O
customer O
service O
... O
I O
have O
a O
request O
for O
a O
refund O
in O
, O
and O
we O
'll O
see O
how O
this O
resolves O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
hair O
dryer O
because O
it O
was O
dual O
voltage O
, O
and O
I O
wished O
to O
use O
it O
in O
both O
the O
United O
Kingdom O
and O
France O
. O
  O
It O
has O
an O
American O
plug O
, O
but O
with O
a O
convertor O
for O
each O
country O
it O
worked O
wonderfully O
! O
  O
I O
could O
not O
be O
happier O
with O
this O
purchase O
. O
  O
Turns O
out O
we O
went O
to O
Italy O
too O
, O
and O
with O
the O
same O
French O
convertor O
, O
the O
dryer O
worked O
in O
Italy O
too O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
product O
- O
compact O
and O
powerful O
- O
worth O
for O
money O

works O
well O
. O
Shipping O
was O
spot O
on O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
receive O
the O
straightening O
pic O
that O
came O
with O
the O
dryer O
. O

love O
it O
love O
the O
arrival O
time O
as O
well O
. O

Very O
short O
cord O
, O
was O
expecting O
much O
longer O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
from O
Target O
a O
little O
over O
three O
months O
ago O
( O
so O
, O
sadly O
I O
ca O
n't O
return O
it O
) O
and O
the O
heating O
element O
has O
already O
died O
. O
I O
like O
the O
folding O
and O
retractable O
cord O
features O
as O
well O
as O
the O
reasonable O
price O
, O
but O
it O
is O
n't O
a O
deal O
if O
you O
have O
to O
replace O
it O
every O
three O
months O
! O
I O
'll O
spend O
a O
little O
more O
next O
time O
and O
get O
a O
higher O
quality O
product O
. O

been O
using O
this O
brand O
in O
my O
bathrooms O
for O
years O

Gives O
my O

volume O
without O
frizz O
. O
My O
hair O
dries O
quicker O
this O
this O
dryer O
, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
super O
hot O
. O
The O
shape O
of O
it O
allows O
you O
to O
shape O
your O
air O
while O
you O
dry O
it O
. O
If O
you O
have O
curly O
hair O
, O
get O
this O
now O
! O
I O
do O
wish O
it O
had O
some O
sort O
of O
attachment O
that O
was O
similar O
to O
a O
concentrator O
so O
I O
could O
blow O
dry O
parts O
of O
my O
hair O
out O
. O
You O
can O
take O
off O
the O
diffuser O
attachment O
but O
it O
's O
not O
hot O
enough O
or O
concentrated O
enough O
to O
make O
my O
hair O
do O
what O
I O
want O
for O
that O
type O
of O
style O
. O
I O
have O
to O
use O
a O
traditional O
dryer O
if O
I O
am O
doing O
something O
other O
than O
just O
being O
curly O
. O

Bought O
this O

This O
is O
a O
great O
item O
my O
college O
age O
daughter O

Awesome O

This O

then O
it O
was O
either O
used O
or O
refurbished O
and O
not O
returned O
to O
is O
original O
state O
. O
It O
overheats O
and O
has O
damaged O
my O
hair O
because O
it O
is O
not O
working O
correctly O
. O
I O
know O

5 O
minutes O
. O

It O
works O
great O
! O
The O
dial O
for O
timing O
it O
's O
backwards O
but O
it O
works O
just O
fine O
. O

I O
used O
to O
spend O
six O
hours O
doing O
my O
girls O
' O
naturally O
coily O
and O
kinky O
hair O
. O
Drying O
time O
has O
now O
been O
cut O
to O
an O
average O
if O
five O
minutes O
, O
which O
in O
turns O
means O
a O
styling O
time O
of O
two O
hours O
total O
on O
the O
girls O
. O
This O
dryer O
gave O
me O
my O
weekends O
back O
. O
Only O
down O
side O
is O
that O
the O
ones O
I O
've O
had O
go O
out O
after O
roughly O
two O
years O
. O
I O
'm O
on O
my O
third O
t3 O
since O
2011 O
. O

I O
have O
very O
fine O
hair O
and O
it O
is O
not O
thick O
, O
so O
when O
I O
go O
outside O
on O
a O
humid O
day O
, O
the O
places O
where O
my O
hair O
is O
naturally O
curly O
curl O
up O
worse O
and O
the O
rest O
loses O
the O
style O
I O
intended O
when O
I O
left O
the O
house O
. O
Static O
was O
a O
big O
issue O
, O
so O
when O
shopping O
for O
a O
blower O
with O
high O
wattage O
, O
high O
heat O
( O
yes O
, O
I O
want O
HOT O
) O
and O
high O
velocity O
, O
I O
found O
this O
one O
hoping O
it O
would O
meet O
the O
requirements O
. O
I O
found O
it O
to O
be O
like O
most O
of O
the O
drug O
- O
store O
blowers O
in O
my O
blower O
- O
graveyard O
in O
the O
closet O
, O
going O
to O
the O
next O
garage O
sale O
. O
I O
just O
did O
not O
meet O
the O
expectations O
, O
not O
enough O
blow O
, O
heat O
and O
I O
still O
had O
frizzy O
static O
hair O
. O
It O
works O
and O
probably O
works O
just O
fine O
for O
those O
who O
have O
thick O
hair O
they O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
damage O
, O
but O
my O
hair O
takes O
2 O
minutes O
flat O
to O
dry O
and O
style O
. O
I O
did O
move O
on O
and O
purchased O
Onei O
MK O
- O
II O
for O
about O
$ O
70 O
taking O
a O
really O
big O
chance O
. O
It O
blew O
me O
away O
literally O
and O
exceeded O
all O
expectations O
. O
So O
for O
fine O
hair O
users O
, O
it O
may O
be O
worthwhile O
to O
shop O
around O
since O
there O
are O
very O
few O
resources O
for O
our O
types O
. O

Best O
hair O
dryer O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
. O

Startlingly O
small O
and O
flimsy O
looking O
, O
with O
a O
thin O
plastic O
grill O
over O
the O
fan O
. O
But O
does O
a O
decent O
job O
, O
with O
good O
air O
on O
the O
high O
setting O
. O
I O
'd O
never O
rely O
on O
this O
for O
every O
day O
or O
for O
a O
long O
trip O
, O
but O
since O
it O
's O
so O
light O
and O
small O
, O
will O
keep O
it O
on O
hand O
for O
overnights O
. O

Works O
great O
! O

his O
dryer O
replaces O
my O
old O
one O
which O
is O
cumbersome O
and O
bulkier O
. O
  O
Does O
a O
great O
job O
. O

very O
compact O
. O
Ideal O
for O
traveling O
. O

I O
wanted O
a O
salon O
quality O
dryer O
and O
got O
it O
! O
  O
This O
dryer O
is O
fast O
, O
easy O
to O
work O
with O
, O
not O
too O
heavy O
and O
does O
a O
fantastic O
job O
. O
  O
Best O
I O
've O
ever O
owned O
. O

great O
buy O

works O
well O
, O
good O
ppwer O
, O
nice O
size O
for O
travel O
. O
would O
recommend O
it O
. O

good O
as O
any O
other O

Great O

great O
value O

Was O
not O
the O
red O
one O
I O
wanted O
, O
but O
is O
sufficient O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
hair O
dryer O
for O
my O
mother O
. O
She O
is O
a O
hair O
stylist O
and O
swears O
by O
it O
. O
She O
says O
it O
takes O
up O
no O
space O
and O
very O
convenient O
when O
mounted O
on O
the O
wall O
. O
Works O
just O
as O
good O
as O
any O
other O
blow O
dryer O
she O
's O
used O
. O
Great O
space O
saver O
. O

This O
dryer O
is O
just O
cheap O
. O
  O
Cheap O
, O
lightweight O
, O
plasticky O
feeling O
. O
  O
Granted O
, O
it O
IS O
all O
of O
those O
things O
but O
I O
have O
a O
much O
nicer O
travel O
hair O
dryer O
that O
does O
n't O
feel O
like O
it O
is O
just O
going O
to O
snap O
in O
two O
... O
unfortunately O
my O
other O
one O
does O
n't O
have O
a O
diffuser O
which O
is O
the O
sole O
reason O
I O
got O
this O
one O
. O
  O
But O
hey O
, O
it O
's O
only O
for O
travel O
... O

Cheap O
blower O
dryer O
. O
It O
does O
n't O
blow O
dry O
very O
hot O
air O
but O
I O
did O
buy O
it O
for O
a O
good O
price O
and O
it O
works O
. O
This O
is O
why O
I O
gave O
it O
3 O
stars O
. O

Small O
enough O
to O
travel O
but O
powerful O
, O
I O
like O
it O
better O
than O
my O
regular O
Revlon O
I O
was O
using O
for O
3 O
years O
. O

I O
just O
hate O
it O
! O
I O
gave O
away O
my O
Babyliss O
thinking O
this O
one O
is O
better O
. O
What O
a O
mistake O
! O
! O
! O
When O
I O
use O
it O
my O
hair O
gets O
opaque O
. O
I O
'm O
very O
disappointment O
and O
is O
too O
late O
to O
return O
it O
. O

VERY O
HEAVY O
- O
seems O
to O
work O
well O
but O
would O
n't O
recommend O
for O
travel O
. O

Worked O
great O
in O
Germany O
and O
the O
UK O
. O
  O
Just O
turn O
the O
butyon O
and O
you O
are O
ready O
for O
overseas O
. O
  O
Lightweight O
. O
  O
Low O
setying O
is O
powerful O
. O
  O
Highly O
recommend O
. O

Wife O
loves O
it O
! O

As O
of O
now O
no O
complaints O
, O
It O
's O
quiet O
and O
does O
the O
job O
. O

Was O
looking O
for O
a O
family O
hair O
dryer O
. O
Got O
a O
great O
deal O
and O
works O
good O
. O
  O
We O
also O
like O
the O
color O
. O

The O
weight O
is O
inordinately O
heavy O
! O
Why O
? O
My O
old O
dryer O
weight O
was O
like O
nothing O
in O
comparison O
. O
It O
does O
the O
job O
, O
but O
I O
'd O
recommend O
a O
lighter O
model O
to O
a O
friend O
. O

The O
real O
product O
is O
bigger O
than O
I O
expected O
but O
it O
does O
make O
your O
hair O
look O
better O
comparing O
with O
other O
regular O
dryers O
. O
And O
I O
love O
the O
color O
! O
! O
! O

My O
mom O
is O
a O
cosmetologist O
& O
has O
always O
supplied O
me O
with O
professional O
grade O
dryers O
for O
my O
thick O
, O
heavy O
hair O
. O
This O
one O
works O
better O
than O
any O
other O
professional O
dryer O
I O
have O
tried O
. O
The O
cost O
was O
more O
reasonable O
too O
. O

The O
hair O
dryer O
works O
as O
expected O
. O

With O
three O
teenage O
girls O
in O
the O
house O
, O
the O
hair O
dryer O
gets O
a O
lot O
of O
use O
. O
A O
LOT O
OF O
USE O
. O
We O
've O
blown O
through O
quite O
a O
few O
hairdryers O
- O
no O
pun O
intended O
. O
This O
one O
however O
, O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
clear O
winner O
. O
As O
a O
stylishly O
bald O
man O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
personally O
vouch O
for O
it O
, O
but O
the O
female O
testimonials O
are O
unanimous O
... O
this O
is O
an O
excellent O
product O
. O
Full O
disclosure O
: O
the O
dog O
is O
n't O
a O
big O
fan O
, O
but O
she O
does O
n't O
like O
baths O
much O
either O
, O
so O
can'r O
be O
surprised O
. O

Great O
little O
hair O
dryer O
for O
the O
money O
. O
No O
cool O
setting O
and O
low O
speed O
is O
really O
low O
, O
but O
I O
still O
like O
it O
and O
would O
recommend O
it O
. O

Love O
, O
love O
, O
love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
! O
  O
I O
've O
been O
looking O
( O
and O
trying O
) O
for O
months O
now O
! O
I O
finally O
found O
the O
perfect O
one O
for O
me O
! O
  O
YEAH O
! O
It O
's O
lightweight O
, O
small O
enough O
to O
travel O
and O
powerful O
. O
So O
easy O
to O
use O
. O
Economical O
, O
too O
! O
  O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
buy O
another O
one O
for O
the O
guest O
bath O
! O
  O
It O
's O
hard O
to O
locate O
great O
hair O
dryers O
when O
you O
find O
one O
that O
you O
like O
in O
a O
hotel O
. O
For O
some O
reason O
Conair O
puts O
1875 O
on O
most O
ALL O
their O
dryers O
, O
so O
it O
's O
hard O
to O
tell O
the O
actual O
model O
number O
when O
you O
find O
one O
that O
you O
like O
... O
  O
Glad O
we O
were O
finally O
able O
to O
track O
this O
one O
down O
! O

I O
bought O
this O
hairdryer O
more O
than O
year O
ago O
when O
my O
last O
one O
lit O
on O
fire O
. O
I O
choose O
this O
one O
because O
I O
know O
the O
Babyliss O
name O
and O
I O
loved O
the O
pattern O
. O
The O
pattern O
IS O
actually O
as O
cute O
as O
it O
looks O
in O
the O
picture O
. O
Weight O
: O
This O
dryer O
weighs O
about O
as O
much O
as O
a O
weighted O
tape O
dispenser O
. O
It O
feels O
like O
a O
professional O
hair O
dryer O
and O
is O
not O
easy O
to O
break O
. O
Design O
: O
The O
cord O
on O
the O
dryer O
is O
somewhat O
rigid O
and O
unwieldy O
. O
It O
became O
easier O
to O
wrangle O
when O
I O
bought O
Velcro O
ties O
for O
the O
cord O

I O
ca O

much O
here O
. O
After O
all O
, O
it O
is O
just O
blowing O
hot O
air O
, O
but O
I O
guess O
that O
I O
can O
say O
that O
it O
dries O
quickly O
. O
Temperature O
: O
The O
hot O

gets O
pretty O
hot O

Not O
hot O
enough O
to O
burn O
your O
scalp O
, O
but O
hot O
enough O
to O
get O
the O
job O
done O
. O

I O
love O
this O
dryer O
. O
I O
use O
it O
as O
both O
my O
everyday O
dryer O
and O
my O
travel O
dryer O
. O
It O
's O
just O
as O
powerful O
as O
a O
full O
- O
size O
but O
without O
the O
weight O
and O
bulk O
. O
I O
'm O
seriously O
never O
going O
back O
to O
a O
full O
- O
size O
dryer O
again O
. O

dryers O
my O
hair O
super O
fast O
and O
no O
frizz O

Just O
love O
it O
, O
freedom O
from O
the O
hooded O
dryer O
! O

Works O
okay O
, O
but O
very O
heavy O
! O

Good O
air O
flow O
. O
Fairly O
quiet O
. O
Seems O
like O
good O
construction O
. O
Location O
of O
the O
buttons O
makes O
them O
easy O
to O
switch O
unintentionally O
. O
I O
think O
this O
is O
a O
winner O
at O
around O
twenty O
six O
bucks O
delivered O
. O

great O
design O
base O
could O
be O
more O
sturdy O

Great O
dryer O
makes O
my O
hair O
feel O
like O
silk O

Has O
a O
good O
volume O
of O
air O
on O
high O
for O
a O
compact O
unit O
, O
but O
the O
trade O
- O
off O
is O
it O
is O
a O
bit O
noisy O
too O
. O
  O
Not O
mention O
in O
the O
listing O
, O
but O
the O
blue O
button O
is O
a O
cool O
air O
button O
and O
works O
as O
would O
be O
expected O
. O
  O
Unlike O
the O
Revlon O
Rvdr5033 O
I O
had O
the O
cool O
button O
on O
this O
unit O
just O
turns O
the O
heat O
off O
and O
back O
on O
when O
released O
and O
does O
not O
change O
the O
fan O
. O
  O
It O
gets O
very O
hot O
on O
high O
and O
so O
did O
the O
Revlon O
. O
  O
Too O
hot O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
but O
it O
appears O
no O
one O
makes O
a O
1500 O
watt O
model O
anymore O
. O
  O
I O
could O
find O
nothing O
but O
1875 O
watt O
models O
even O
in O
compact O
. O
  O
Not O
pictured O
or O
mentioned O
but O
this O
one O
like O
all O
of O
them O
has O
the O
huge O
block O
on O
the O
cord O
end O
with O
a O
GFI O
and O
AC O
plug O
as O
part O
of O
that O
block O
. O
  O
Even O
though O
they O
tell O
you O
not O
to O
put O
two O
GFI O
's O
on O
the O
same O
circuit O
and O
there O
has O
n't O
been O
a O
house O
built O
in O
almost O
40 O
years O
without O
a O
GFI O
covering O
any O
outlet O
in O
every O
bathroom O
the O
requirement O
for O
this O
still O
persists O
. O
  O
I O
like O
that O
you O
can O
easily O
take O
the O
cover O
of O
the O
fan O
in O
the O
rear O
for O
cleaning O
. O
  O
Not O
many O
of O
the O
compact O
models O
seem O
to O
have O
that O
feature O
. O
  O
Overall O
a O
good O
unit O
. O
  O
Time O
will O
tell O
how O
durable O
and O
long O
lasting O
it O
is O
. O
  O
I O
can O
only O
hope O
it O
is O
as O
good O
in O
that O
area O
as O
the O
one O
it O
replaced O
. O
  O
Update O
7/21/15 O
: O
Well O
it O
is O
NOT O
very O
long O
lasting O
. O
  O
About O
4 O
months O
in O
it O
suddenly O
started O
smoking O
and O
got O
very O
hot O
very O
fast O
did O
some O
nice O
sparking O
and O
arcing O
, O
then O
quit O
. O
  O
We O
will O
see O
if O
they O
honor O
the O
warranty O
. O

Great O
size O
and O
does O
a O
good O
job O
. O
The O
detachable O
black O
diffuser O
piece O
is O
extremely O
hard O
to O
get O
off O
( O
at O
least O
mine O
was O
) O
so O
consider O
whether O
you O
will O
take O
it O
off O
and O
on O
often O
. O

I O
will O
now O
be O
saving O
money O
by O
going O
less O
to O
my O
hairstylist O
. O
This O
blowdryer O
dried O
my O
hair O
2x O
faster O
than O
a O
previous O
blowdryer O
I O
had O
. O
  O
I O
wished O
I O
had O
bought O
this O
blowdryer O
years O
ago O
! O

Best O
hair O
dryer O
I O
've O
ever O
owned O
. O
  O
I O
'm O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
product O
. O

it O
did O
n't O
fit O
me O
, O
I O
WAS O
NOT O
TALL O
  O
TO O
FIT O
UNDER O
IT O
SO O
I O
HAD O
TO O
SIT O
ON O
A O
BIG O
CHAIR O
COUTON O
  O
TO O
FIT O
MY O
HEAD O
UNDER O
IT O
. O
  O
I O
HAD O
ONE O
BEFOR O
THAT O
THE O
NECK O
PART O
WENT O
UP O
OR O
DOWN O
AND O
I O
though O
this O
one O
did O
it O
too O
. O

I O
've O
been O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
deal O
on O
a O
hair O
dryer O
for O
weeks O
and O
finally O
came O
across O
this O
one O
. O
Great O
purchase O
. O

gave O
3 O
stars O
because O
it O
is O
advertised O
as O
having O
2 O
speeds O
and O
3 O
heat O
settings O
. O
It O
does O
but O
the O
heat O
settings O
are O
fixed O
to O
certain O
speeds O
. O
You O
can O
not O
have O
high O
speed O
with O
low O
heat O
or O
low O
speed O
with O
high O
heat O
, O
only O
high O
heat O
with O
high O
speed O
or O
low O
heat O
with O
low O
speed O
etc O
. O
Wanted O
to O
control O
heat O
and O
speed O
separately O
. O
Nothing O
wrong O
with O
unit O
otherwise O
but O
lowered O
rating O
due O
to O
not O
being O
able O
to O
change O
heat O
and O
speed O
settings O
independently O
. O
Returned O
for O
refund O

Fantastic O
Hair O
Dryer O

Love O
it O
! O
! O
! O

It O
is O
adequate O
. O
I O
do O
wish O
the O
prongs O
of O
the O
diffuser O
were O
a O
more O
flexible O
or O
softer O
. O
It O
kind O
of O
hurts O
our O
heads O
. O

this O
is O
a O
great O
little O
hairdryer O
- O
I O
ordered O
it O
for O
travel O
. O
  O
It O
's O
a O
little O
heavy O
and O
large O
for O
a O
travel O
dryer O
but O
most O
travel O
dryers O
are O
loud O
and O
cheap O
and O
take O
forever O
to O
dry O
your O
hair O
. O
  O
This O
one O
is O
as O
powerful O
as O
a O
full O
size O
dryer O
. O
  O
If O
suitcase O
space O
is O
n't O
an O

this O
is O
the O

The O
brush O
attachment O
does O
n't O
work O
well O
through O
the O
hair O

I O
was O
actually O
looking O
for O
something O
else O
when O
I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
and O
thought O
why O
not O
. O
  O
I O
am O
very O
pleased O
with O
this O
purchase O
. O
  O
I O
have O
fine O
shoulder O
length O
hair O
and O
it O
did O
not O
take O
an O
hour O
to O
dry O
, O
as O
another O
reviewer O
stated O
. O
  O
( O
Of O
course O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
attempt O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
when O
it O
is O
dripping O
wet O
either O
. O
  O
I O
wrap O
my O
hair O
in O
a O
towel O
and O
do O
other O
things O
for O
a O
while O
before O
attempting O
to O
blow O
dry O
. O
) O
  O
Anyway O
, O
I O
was O
worried O
at O
first O
because O
the O
packaging O
and O
most O
of O
the O
instructions O
are O
in O
Japanese O
. O
  O
But O
I O
used O
it O
on O
the O
lower O
voltage O
and O
it O
was O
fine O
. O
  O
I O
used O
the O
regular O
brush O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
, O
as O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
how O
to O
use O
the O
round O
brush O
yet O
. O
  O
I O
dried O
most O
of O
my O
hair O
and O
then O
used O
this O
upside O
down O
to O
give O
my O
hair O
some O
lift O
and O
bounce O
, O
which O
it O
did O
. O
  O
Also O
, O
my O
hair O
does O
not O
look O
frizzy O
, O
like O
it O
does O
at O
times O
when O
using O
a O
regular O
blow O
dryer O
( O
I O
believe O
because O
sometimes O
a O
regular O
blow O
dryer O
both O
damages O
and O
tends O
to O
tangle O
your O
hair O
) O
. O
  O
My O
hair O
actually O
looks O
shiny O
as O
well O
as O
smooth O
( O
as O
if O
I O
flat O
ironed O
it O
) O
. O
  O
I O
would O
give O
this O
a O
try O
if O
you O
are O
someone O
who O
likes O
the O
look O
of O
their O
hair O
when O
it O
is O
blow O
dried O
and/or O
flat O
ironed O
but O
with O
what O
seems O
much O
less O
damage O
. O
  O
I O
think O
you O
could O
get O
away O
with O
using O
just O
this O
dryer O
and O
a O
little O
serum O
( O
depending O
on O
how O
naturally O
straight O
your O
hair O
is O
) O
. O
I O
am O
excited O
to O
use O
this O
and O
try O
to O
figure O
out O
the O
round O
brush O
too O
. O

Works O
very O
well O
thus O
far O
. O

I O
am O
small O
with O
shoulder O
problems O
and O
this O
is O
very O
compact O
and O
light O
weight O
. O
  O
It O
packs O
a O
punch O
with O
power O
! O

excellent O
item O

Since O
my O
hair O
is O
too O
thin O
, O
it O
dries O
it O
in O
a O
minute O
! O
But O
leaves O
it O
so O
hard O
frizzy O
:( O
it O
is O
also O
very O
, O
very O
loud O
! O
! O
! O
My O
duaghter O
loves O
it O
, O
her O
hair O
is O
long O
and O
thick O
, O
she O
does O
not O
complain O
. O
I O
did O
mot O
return O
it O
, O
my O
daughter O
uses O
it O
. O

Does O
what O
its O
suppose O
to O
do O
, O
like O
the O
ability O
to O
clean O
it O
. O

Very O
good O

Love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
Dries O
my O
hair O
in O
no O
time O

The O
Nano O
technology O
is O
great O
. O
Blow O
dry O
is O
much O
faster O
than O
regular O
product O
. O
Keep O
my O
hair O
style O
nice O
( O
no O
dryness O
) O
. O

I O
'm O
  O
in O
love O
with O
this O
hair O
dryer O
It O
's O
small O
but O
really O
dry O
's O
my O
hair O
fast O
and O
does O
a O
wonderful O
job O
. O

it O
took O
me O
a O
while O
to O
find O
a O
blow O
dryer O
that O
actually O
made O
it O
easier O
to O
do O
my O
hair O
, O
usually O
my O
hair O
would O
still O
be O
super O
fluffy O
and O
still O
kind O
of O
tangled O
after O
blow O
drying O
. O
I O
have O
really O
kinky O
curls O
and O
after O
using O
this O
my O
hair O
was O
almost O
straight O
. O
I O
only O
used O
a O
flat O
iron O
so O
it O
would O
be O
sleek O
but O
this O
blow O
dryer O
really O
works O
. O
it O
made O
my O
hair O
shiny O
and O
straight O
and O
it O
gets O
really O
hot O
which O
helps O
a O
great O
deal O
. O
I O
totally O
recommend O
this O
blow O
dryer O
to O
anyone O
especially O
if O
you O
have O
kinky O
curly O
hair O
like O
my O
self O
. O

I O
had O
one O
before O
and O
I O
love O
it O
. O
  O
It O
's O
off O
the O
counter O
and O
out O
of O
the O
way O
. O

Works O
great O
; O
looks O
good O
on O
wall O
. O

Dries O
really O
fast O
. O
I O
have O
to O
use O
a O
brush O
and O
brush O
my O
hair O
while O
using O
this O
dryer O
or O
else O
it O
is O
just O
an O
odd O
mess O
. O
I O
live O
in O
area O
with O
high O
humidity O
off O
the O
Gulf O
coast O
and O
my O
hair O
stays O
flat O
all O
day O
! O
Even O
straighter O
than O
my O
straight O
haired O
friends O
. O
I O
do O
have O
to O
use O
another O
dryer O
when O
I O
want O
to O
wear O
my O
curls O
because O
this O
dryer O
takes O
them O
out O
. O

Works O
great O
. O

i O
love O
the O
cord O
keeper O
Conair O
dryers O
. O
  O
Much O
easier O
to O
store O
. O
  O
My O
old O
Conair O
cord O
keeper O
( O
less O
expensive O
, O
2 O
speed O
, O
2 O
heat O
settings O
) O
wore O
out O
at O
the O
plug O
. O
  O
Could O
n't O
be O
without O
a O
blow O
dryer O
so O
looked O
to O
trusty O
Amazon O
. O
  O
I O
saw O
this O
model O
and O
read O
the O
reviews O
. O
  O
I O
liked O
that O
it O
had O
a O
cool O
setting O
and O
did O
n't O
have O
to O
keep O
, O
the O
button O
pushed O
for O
the O
cool O
shot O
. O
  O
I O
also O
like O
that O
it O
has O
the O
cord O
keeper O
. O
  O
But O
the O
best O
feature O
about O
it O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
is O
that O
it O
is O
MUCH O
QUIETER O
than O
the O
less O
expensive O
model O
. O
  O
I O
get O
ready O
for O
work O
in O
the O
early O
mornings O
and O
this O
model O
produces O
a O
moderate O
hum O
, O
compared O
to O
the O
blasting O
roar O
the O
cheaper O
model O
makes O
. O
  O
If O
a O
quieter O
blow O
dryer O
is O
what O
you O
're O
looking O
for O
, O
with O
1875 O
power O
, O
this O
is O
your O
dryer O
. O
  O
Worth O
the O
extra O
money O
! O
! O
! O
  O
Buy O
it O
, O
you O
wo O
n't O
be O
sorry O
! O
  O
Super O
fast O
delivery O
! O
  O
Ps O
, O
use O
the O
concentrator O
nozzle O
, O
cuts O
down O
on O
frizz O
. O

Exceeded O
my O
expectations O
. O

This O
hair O
dryer O
met O
all O
of O
my O
expectations O
. O
I O
love O
its O
compact O
design O
. O
The O
bonnet O
is O
large O
enough O
to O
fit O
over O
rollers O
, O
and O
on O
the O
medium O
heat O
setting O
it O
gets O
warm O
enough O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
in O
10 O
minutes O
. O
I O
think O
it O
's O
a O
quality O
product O
with O
a O
thoughtful O
design O
. O

Works O
great O
! O
Night O
light O
still O
works O
and O
we O
've O
had O
it O
over O
a O
year O
! O

I O
have O
long O
curly O
hair O
3b O
. O
I O
bought O
this O
dyer O
thinking O
it O
would O
work O
wonders O
on O
my O
hair O
. O
First O
, O
I O
think O
it O
does O
a O
great O
job O
and O
dries O
my O
hair O
very O
fast O
. O
However O
, O
I O
would O
prefer O
to O
have O
the O
teeth O
longer O
and O
better O
way O
to O
cup O
the O
hair O
so O
to O
speak O
. O
My O
hair O
gets O
caught O
in O
the O
back O
and O
ends O
up O
with O
tge O
burning O
hair O
smell O
. O
Secondly O
, O
I O
bought O
this O
dyer O
6 O
weeks O
ago O
and O
it O
's O
already O
broken O
. O
Amazon O
is O
amazing O
and O
agreed O
to O
refund O
my O
money O
. O
I O
think O
this O
would O
work O
better O
for O
women O
with O
short O
curly O
hair O
more O
than O
anything O
. O

Love O
it O
. O
It O
fits O
on O
the O
wall O
and O
it O
's O
out O
of O
the O
way O
. O
Nite O
lite O
is O
bright O
also O

Bought O
one O
of O
these O
for O
a O
spare O
bedroom O
when O
we O
have O
guests O
. O
Took O
a O
shower O
in O
there O
one O
day O
and O
LOVED O
this O
so O
much O
I O
threw O
mine O
away O
and O
bought O
one O
for O
myself O
too O
. O

Operates O
like O
a O
very O
cheap O
hairdryer O
. O
We O
bought O
for O
our O
10yr O
old O
daughter O
and O
it O
's O
fine O
for O
her O
. O
Takes O
longer O
to O
dry O
hair O
than O
most O
. O
We O
may O
just O
have O
a O
fluke O
... O

The O
vulcano O
of O
hair O
dryers O

EXCELENTE O
PRODUCTO O

Works O
well O
but O
extremely O
loud O
. O

so O
far O
so O
good O
. O
  O
My O
husband O
ordered O
it O
, O
but O
we O
both O
use O
it O
. O
  O
Have O
had O
a O
similar O
  O
one O
before O
and O
used O
it O
for O
years O
. O
Hoping O
this O
one O
last O
as O
long O
. O

This O
blow O
dryer O
was O
heavy O
and O
too O
hot O
. O
  O
At O
the O
time O
of O
purchase O
this O
product O
there O
were O
plenty O
in O
stock O
. O
As O
soon O
as O
I O
got O
mine O
delivered O
. O
The O
product O
page O
shows O
this O
product O
is O
no O
longer O
available O
. O
Anyway O
, O
I O
returned O
it O
and O
got O
the O
Babyliss O
one O
. O
Much O
happier O
with O
the O
other O
purchase O
. O

I O
hope O
it O
last O
long O
than O
the O
one O
I O
got O
last O
year O

This O
is O
much O
lighter O
than O
the O
older O
model O
I O
had O
and O
love O
the O
different O
speeds O
and O
power O
. O

Great O
! O

Light O
is O
too O
bright O

Broke O
within O
2 O
months O
. O
  O
I O
would O
recommend O
buying O
a O
few O
levels O
up O
as O
I O
have O
had O
those O
in O
the O
past O
and O
they O
do O
not O
break O
. O

I O
love O
this O
dryer O

Cheap O
and O
enough O
for O
normal O
use O
. O

Good O
Product O

I O
love O
the O
smaller O
size O
of O
this O
hair O
dryer O
, O
which O
makes O
it O
great O
for O
travel O
. O
At O
1875w O
, O
it O
's O
also O
still O
powerful O
enough O
to O
dry O
my O
medium O
- O
length O
, O
thick O
hair O
. O
( O
If O
you O
have O
thinner O
or O
shorter O
hair O
, O
it O
might O
be O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
dry O
your O
hair O
on O
the O
lower O
setting O
. O
) O
I O
also O
really O
like O
that O
this O
comes O
with O
two O
different O
diffusers O
, O
making O
it O
easier O
to O
achieve O
the O
style O
I O
want O
when O
drying O
my O
hair O
. O
This O
product O
was O
provided O
for O
testing O
purposes O
, O
but O
all O
opinions O
are O
my O
own O
. O

Chose O
this O
particular O
hair O
dryer O
after O
comparing O
the O
features O
with O
other O
similar O
products O
. O
I O
am O
so O
glad O
that O
I O
went O
with O
this O
one O
because O
it O
is O
the O
best O
hair O
dryer O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
! O
! O
Ever O
! O
! O
I O
am O
not O
even O
talking O
about O
the O
fact O
that O
drying O
my O
hair O
time O
is O
cut O
in O
half O
, O
but O
what O
is O
really O
amazing O
that O
my O
hair O
looks O
so O
much O
better O
. O
It O
suddenly O
has O
some O
shine O
, O
including O
the O
ends O
that O
use O
to O
look O
very O
frizzy O
. O
And O
that O
is O
not O
all O
. O
I O
use O
round O
brush O
  O
while O
drying O
my O
hair O
and O
now O
that O
is O
enough O
to O
lift O
the O
roots O
of O
my O
hair O
! O
. O
I O
use O
to O
use O
a O
product O
that O
suppose O
to O
help O
lift O
the O
roots O
and O
I O
hated O
because O
that O
product O
was O
smelly O
and O
It O
really O
was O
n't O
doing O
much O
, O
but O
now O
this O
amazing O
hair O
dryer O
makes O
my O
hair O
look O
healthy O
and O
even O
fuller O
because O
of O
the O
lift O
. O
I O
LOVE O
IT O
! O
. O

As O
always O
, O
the O
Oster O
Wall O
Hair O
Dryer O
is O
convenient O
and O
I O
am O
satisfied O
. O
Although O
, O
my O
previous O
ones O
from O
many O
years O
ago O
were O
somewhat O
smaller O
. O

This O
blow O
dryer O
is O
great O
. O
I O
use O
it O
all O
the O
time O
. O
  O
Mainly O
on O
extensions O
. O
  O
Have O
not O
tried O
it O
on O
natural O
hair O
( O
4a-4c O
) O
yet O
. O
  O
It O
should O
be O
fine O
. O
  O
Makes O
drying O
my O
hair O
so O
much O
faster O
and O
easier O

just O
what O
I O
wonted O
. O
love O
it O
I O
can O
move O
around O
and O
sleep O
in O
it O
. O

True O
Story O
.... O
I O
have O
spent O
approximately O
$ O
500-$700 O
on O
different O
hair O
and O
blow O
dryers O
. O
I O
have O
all O
from O
the O
cheap O
ones O
to O
the O
expensive O
ones O
and O
this O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
damn O
blow O
/ O
hair O
dryer O
I O
've O
owned O
. O
I O
am O
a O
black O
woman O
with O
natural O
4c O
hair O
that O
means O
thick O
and O
coarse O
and O
typically O
when O
blow O
drying O
my O
hair O
it O
feels O
crunchy O
but O
this O
dryer O
did O
not O
make O
my O
hair O
feel O
like O
that O
. O
Of O
course O
I O
used O
the O
LOC O
method O
with O
Alikay O
Naturals O
products O
before O
blow O
drying O
my O
hair O
and O
it O
turned O
out O
straight O
like O
I O
needed O
it O
to O
be O
. O
I O
'm O
super O
happy O
and O
satisfied O
. O
Also O
I O
used O
the O
hair O
pick O
yo O
blow O
dry O
my O
hair O
and O
it O
did O
not O
pop O
off O
nor O
did O
I O
break O
the O
teeth O
in O
the O
pick O
. O
Dynamite O
! O
  O
If O
it O
pick O
does O
pop O
off O
just O
use O
heat O
resistant O
double O
side O
tape O
to O
keep O
it O
on O
. O

Excellent O
and O
efficient O
. O

I O
should O
have O
read O
through O
more O
of O
the O
reviews O
. O
  O
This O
is O
definitely O
NOT O
the O
hair O
dryer O
you O
want O
if O
you O
have O
arthritis O
. O
:-( O
  O
My O
husband O
has O
no O
issues O
and O
even O
he O
thinks O
it O
's O
too O
heavy O
. O
  O
It O
blows O
great O
. O
  O
No O
complaints O
there O
. O
  O
Just O
absolutely O
not O
the O
hair O
dryer O
for O
you O
if O
you O
have O
small O
hands O
or O
arthritis O
. O

Really O
good O
product O
. O

It O
is O
good O
. O

was O
n't O
what O
I O
expected O
. O
  O
Thought O
it O
would O
have O
been O
more O
powerful O
. O

This O
is O
a O
really O
neat O
, O
compact O
hair O
dryer O
. O
It O
dried O
my O
shoulder O
length O
hair O
pretty O
quickly O
. O
  O
I O
did O
not O
use O
the O
concentrator O
nozzle O
for O
getting O
my O
hair O
dry O
, O
but O
I O
did O
use O
the O
thin O
nozzle O
with O
a O
round O
brush O
for O
styling O
purposes O
. O
  O
I O
really O
liked O
that O
this O
hair O
dryer O
has O
3 O
speed O
settings O
, O
2 O
heat O
settings O
, O
and O
a O
cool O
shot O
function O
. O
  O
I O
used O
all O
3 O
of O
these O
. O
  O
The O
cool O
shot O
function O
is O
probably O
my O
favorite O
, O
it O
really O
sets O
your O
style O
in O
place O
. O
  O
The O
hair O
dryer O
is O
pretty O
light O
and O
the O
handle O
is O
ergonomically O
designed O
to O
feel O
good O
in O
your O
hand O
, O
and O
it O
does O
. O
  O
I O
do O
have O
to O
mention O
that O
the O
first O
time O
I O
used O
it O
, O
there O
was O
a O
distinct O
burning O
smell O
, O
I O
was O
a O
little O
concerned O
about O
it O
, O
but O
after O
about O
a O
minute O
or O
so O
into O
use O
, O
it O
stopped O
and O
I O
have O
n't O
noticed O
it O
again O
since O
. O
  O
Also O
, O
the O
cord O
on O
this O
hair O
dryer O
is O
THICK O
, O
as O
in O
it O
is O
not O
going O
to O
twist O
and O
kink O
up O
, O
it O
is O
a O
quality O
cord O
that O
it O
going O
to O
last O
a O
LONG O
time O
. O
  O
All O
in O
all O
, O
this O
is O
a O
really O
good O
hair O
dryer O
, O
  O
If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
something O
on O
the O
smaller O
side O
, O
something O
lightweight O
, O
that O
does O
a O
great O
job O
quickly O
, O
this O
is O
a O
good O
option O

I O
like O
it O

It O
works O
for O
me O
well O
because O
I O
have O
thin O
hair O
, O
if O
you O
have O
thick O
hair O
or O
very O
long O
hair O
, O
you O
will O
spend O
five O
hours O
with O
it O
. O
It O
works O
well O
and O
is O
very O
comfortable O
. O

thanks O

I O
love O
it O
's O
compact O
design O
and O
it O
perfectly O
dries O
my O
hair O
within O
minutes O
. O
My O
4 O
star O
review O
is O
due O
to O
the O
concentrator O
, O
it O
fells O
off O
atleast O
once O
in O
your O
5 O
minute O
use O
which O
is O
a O
pain O
. O
If O
that O
does O
n't O
bother O
you O
then O
this O
is O
the O
perfect O
dryer O
which O
does O
n't O
occupy O
a O
lot O
of O
space O
like O
other O
fancy O
ones O
. O

Great O
hair O
dryer O
. O
Drys O
hair O
quickly O
and O
without O
allot O
of O
noise O

I O
have O
fine O
hair O
but O
A O
LOT O
of O
it O
and O
normally O
takes O
me O
over O
an O
hour O
to O
blow O
dry O
my O
hair O
. O
  O
My O
hairstylist O
uses O
this O
on O
my O
hair O
and O
it O
cuts O
the O
drying O
time O
in O
half O
, O
so O
I O
purchased O
one O
to O
use O
at O
home O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
I O
would O
do O
without O
it O
! O

A O
must O
have O
for O
any O
girl O

one O
was O
getting O
way O
too O
hot O
and O
frying O
my O
hair O
. O
  O
It O
's O
not O
too O
heavy O
nor O
too O
loud O
. O
  O
All O
in O
all O
, O
I O
would O
recommend O
this O
product O
! O
! O

This O
thing O
has O
so O
much O
power O

nearly O
blow O
the O
hair O
right O
off O
your O
head O

2 O
days O

Great O
product O
. O
  O
Cuts O
dry O
time O
in O
half O
when O
compared O
to O
other O
dryers O
. O
  O
Purchased O
my O
own O
and O
when O
my O
daughter O
borrowed O
it O
she O
loved O
it O
so O
I O
ordered O
another O
for O
her O
as O
a O
gift O
. O
  O
Great O
product O
at O
a O
reasonable O
price O
. O

This O
dryer O
made O
my O
hair O
frizzy O
and O
rough O
feeling O
, O
not O
what O
anyone O
wants O
from O
their O
blow O
dryer O
. O
  O
It O
also O
felt O
cheap O
and O
was O
loud O
, O
like O
those O
terrible O
blow O
dryers O
in O
hotel O
rooms O
. O
  O
This O
was O
a O
dud O
and O
returned O
. O

Great O

Takes O
2 O
hours O
to O
dry O
, O
but O
easier O
to O
sit O
under O
than O
the O
hard O
hat O
dryers O
! O
My O
hair O
is O
thick O
shoulder O
length O
and O
I O
use O
the O
jumbo O
pink O
rollers O
to O
set O
. O

Nearly O
set O
my O
hair O
alight O
and O
blew O
all O
the O
sockets O
in O
the O
house!Item O
RETURNED O
and O
refund O
awaiting O
! O
Do O
not O
trust O
it O
! O

This O
dryer O
has O
alot O
of O
power,,different O
heating O
settings,,,i O
was O
just O
use O
to O
one O
! O
Well O
worth O
the O
money,,i O
have O
looked O
around O
and O
this O
is O
cheaper O
and O
a O
better O
product O
! O
Well O
worth O
buying O

I O
have O
extremely O
thick O
hair O
. O
It O
typically O
takes O
30 O
minutes O
to O
dry O
it O
all O
. O
I O
have O
been O
able O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
within O
5 O
- O
10 O
minutes O
with O
this O
dryer O
. O
The O
concentrator O
helps O
reduce O
frizz O
from O
my O
frizzy O
hair O
and O
makes O
it O
easier O
to O
straighten O
. O
I O
have O
yet O
to O
use O
the O
diffuser O
but O
it O
's O
amazing O
overall O
! O
! O

Size O
is O
a O
little O
large O
but O
it O
works O
really O
well O
love O
the O
retractable O
cord O
. O

I O
received O
this O
in O
the O
mail O
and O
it O
came O
in O
a O
cute O
box O
packaged O
nice O
and O
tight O
. O
It O
was O
shipped O
in O
a O
timely O
manner O
and O
came O
to O
me O
in O
perfect O
condition O
. O
I O
love O
how O
compact O
this O
blow O
dryer O
is O
... O
I O
can O
take O
it O
with O
me O
when O
I O
go O
on O
vacation O
and O
It O
wo O
nt O
take O
up O
valuable O
space O
in O
my O
suitcase!!!I O
have O
the O
pink O
and O
black O
one O
and O
it O
is O
super O
cute O
! O
! O
I O
love O
how O
stylish O
it O
is O
. O
It O
comes O
with O
2 O
attachments O
( O
diffusers O
) O
. O
one O
is O
wider O
than O
the O
other O
one O
. O
They O
are O
easy O
to O
attach O
and O
easy O
to O
use O
. O
I O
love O
to O
use O
mine O
after O
blow O
drying O
my O
hair O
without O
one O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
and O
then O
finishing O
off O
with O
the O
diffuser O
  O
leaving O
my O
hair O
shiny O
and O
soft O
. O
The O
cord O
is O
long O
enough O
to O
be O
able O
to O
set O
at O
a O
table O
and O
dry O
your O
hair O
if O
need O
be O
The O
cord O
is O
strong O
and O
sturdy O
so O
it O
should O
last O
a O
long O
time O
. O
The O
dryer O
itself O
is O
very O
powerful O
.. O
I O
could O
not O
believe O
how O
hard O
it O
actually O
blows O
.. O
it O
comes O
with O
settings O
so O
that O
you O
can O
pick O
the O
one O
right O
for O
you O
and O
your O
hair O
.. O
I O
received O
this O
in O
exchange O
for O
my O
honest O
and O
unbiased O
review O
and O
I O
really O
think O
this O
is O
a O
great O
blow O
dryer O
and O
has O
a O
great O
price!!I O
will O
be O
using O
this O
for O
years O
to O
come O
! O
! O

Nice O
design O
and O
the O
night O
light O
is O
an O
added O
bonus O
. O

This O
hairdryer O
lasted O
maybe O
two O
weeks O
after O
which O
time O
it O
sounded O
like O
something O
broke O
internally O
and O
was O
quickly O
followed O
by O
a O
burning O
smell O
. O
I O
tried O
taking O
it O
apart O
to O
see O
if O
I O
could O
simply O
try O
removing O
whatever O
piece O
had O
gotten O
caught O
in O
the O
motor O
/ O
fan O
to O
no O
avail O
. O
Thus O
, O
had O
to O
trash O
it O
. O
I O
recommend O
getting O
a O
nicer O
hairdryer O
... O
something O
in O
the O
$ O
30 O
- O
$ O
40 O
range O
which O
will O
last O
a O
long O
time O
. O
  O
This O
was O
crap O
and O
I O
should O
have O
known O
better O
:) O

great O
dryer O
, O
and O
very O
cheap O
too O
! O

Love O
it O
! O
  O
Definitely O
a O
salon O
- O
style O
dryer O
; O
so O
much O
faster O
on O
my O
thick O
hair O
than O
conventional O
dryers O
. O

Very O
heavy O
for O
a O
small O
dryer O
but O
quality O
was O
great- O
drys O
my O
hair O
very O
quickly O
and O
packs O
nicely O
. O
I O
use O
this O
as O
a O
travel O
dryer O
. O

This O
is O
perfect O
for O
curly O
hair O
. O
The O
difuser O
piece O
gets O
popped O
in O
when O
you O
receive O
it O
and O
it O
does O
not O
fall O
out O
! O
Its O
there O
to O
stay O
. O
I O
love O
this O
product O
! O

I O
love O
it O
! O
! O
! O

I O
have O
had O
the O
Remington O
blow O
dryer O
for O
5 O
years O
but O
unfortunately O
I O
left O
it O
at O
my O
daughters O
home O
. O
  O
I O
have O
called O
a O
few O
times O
to O
get O
her O
to O
ship O
it O
back O
but O
she O
keeps O
forgetting O
so O
I O
bought O
another O
. O
  O
Love O
it O
just O
as O
well O
as O
my O
older O
one O
and O
looks O
the O
same O
except O
for O
color O
. O
  O
Found O
out O
my O
daughter O
loved O
the O
blow O
dryer O
which O
is O
why O
she O
kept O
forgetting O
to O
mail O
it O
back O
to O
me O
. O
  O
We O
both O
would O
recommend O
this O
hair O
blower O
.... O
especially O
if O
you O
have O
thick O
hair O
like O
we O
do O
. O
  O
It O
works O
great O
. O

This O
item O
died O
after O
maybe O
the O
10th O
time O
i O
used O
it O
. O
Good O
thing O
it O
is O
inexpensive O
. O
Save O
your O
money O
and O
do O
nt O
buy O
this O
, O
keep O
looking O
. O

installation O
was O
easy O
. O
Have O
not O
used O
it O
yet O
. O
Not O
too O
big O
or O
bulky O
. O

Love O
it O
. O
Drys O
my O
hair O
fast O
and O
now O
I O
can O
dry O
with O
one O
hand O
instead O
of O
two O
hands O
. O
It O
gets O
really O
hot O
two O
. O
Only O
use O
the O
small O
comb O
attachment O
. O
I O
wish O
it O
had O
a O
thicker O
brush O
attachment O
. O

The O
wattage O
is O
great O
. O
  O
However O
, O
the O
heat O
and O
fan O
controls O
seem O
to O
be O
in O
the O
way O
  O
on O
  O
the O
handle O
. O
  O
I O
need O
to O
  O
choke O
up O
closer O
to O
the O
heating O
area O
so O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
accidentally O
move O
the O
settings O
. O

When O
I O
ordered O
this O
hair O
dryer O
, O
I O
ordered O
the O
black O
with O
Pink O
petals O
. O
What O
I O
received O
was O
an O
all O
pink O
hair O
dryer O
. O
I O
was O
a O
little O
disappointed O
that O
I O
did O
n't O
receive O
the O
actual O
hair O
dryer O
that O
I O
ordered O
and O
I O
believe O
that O
the O
other O
hair O
dryer O
might O
have O
been O
better O
than O
this O
one O
. O
I O
have O
ordered O
other O
hair O
dryers O
from O
Xtava O
in O
the O
past O
and O
have O
been O
really O
impressed O
with O
the O
quality O
and O
performance O
of O
the O
hair O
dryers O
. O
This O
hair O
dryer O
is O
nice O
and O
small O
, O
so O
it O
is O
compact O
and O
easily O
fits O
even O
in O
a O
drawer O
. O
Even O
though O
it O
is O
small O
it O
is O
a O
powerful O
hair O
dryer O
and O
does O
dry O
my O
hair O
without O
frizzing O
it O
. O
To O
me O
it O
seemed O
a O
little O
heavy O
for O
it O
being O
such O
a O
small O
dryer O
. O
It O
was O
actually O
louder O
than O
my O
bigger O
hair O
dryers O
. O
It O
does O
have O
a O
nice O
long O
cord O
so O
I O
am O
able O
to O
move O
around O
more O
and O
not O
be O
confined O
in O
standing O
in O
one O
place O
. O
It O
does O
come O
with O
2 O
attachments O
1 O
nozzle O
is O
long O
and O
thin O
and O
the O
other O
is O
shorter O
and O
wider O
. O
It O
does O
have O
3 O
heat O
selections O
( O
low O
, O
medium O
and O
high O
) O
and O
does O
have O
2 O
speeds O
( O
gentle O
and O
strong O
) O
. O
The O
feature O
I O
like O
the O
best O
about O
the O
dryer O
is O
the O
cool O
air O
which O
shoots O
out O
a O
burst O
of O
cool O
air O
and O
that O
is O
why O
my O
hair O
does O
n't O
frizz O
when O
using O
this O
dryer O
. O
I O
was O
able O
to O
receive O
this O
hair O
dryer O
so O
that O
I O
can O
provide O
my O
honest O
opinion O
and O
feedback O
. O

The O
retractable O
cord O
is O
awesome O
and O
the O
airflow O
is O
good O
. O
Very O
nice O
product O
. O

I O
was O
definitely O
skeptical O
of O
paying O
this O
much O
for O
a O
hair O
dryer O
, O
especially O
one O
with O
a O
brand O
that O
I O
have O
never O
even O
heard O
of O
making O
hair O
dryers O
. O
  O
But O
the O
reviews O
were O
good O
so O
I O
decided O
I O
'd O
give O
it O
a O
try O
. O
I O
had O
really O
high O
expectations O
and O
they O
were O
definitely O
met O
! O
I O
LOVE O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
I O
have O
wavy O
/ O
curly O
hair O
and O
usually O
when O
I O
blow O
dry O
it O
, O
it O
gets O
really O
frizzy O
, O
this O
blow O
dryer O
gets O
rid O
of O
at O
least O
75 O
% O
of O
that O
friziness O
, O
if O
not O
more O
. O
And O
the O
diffuser O
it O
comes O
with O
is O
amazing O
! O
Another O
plus O
, O
is O
that O
it O
is O
soooo O
much O
quieter O
than O
any O
other O
blow O
dryer O
I O
've O
ever O
had O
! O
! O

This O
is O
absolutely O
the O
BEST O
hand O
hair O
dryer O
I O
have O
every O
had O
. O
  O
I O
have O
4B O
hair O
/ O
natural O
, O
  O
and O
it O
dries O
my O
hair O
in O
less O
time O
and O
straight O
! O
  O
You O
will O
not O
go O
wrong O
with O
this O

The O
Anemone O
wind O
flower O
1875 O
Blow O
dryer O
is O
amazing O
! O
! O
! O
  O
I O
Love O
it O
and O
so O
does O
the O
rest O
of O
my O
family O
. O
It O
has O
multiple O
heat O
speeds O
and O
a O
cold O
shot O
and O
trust O
me O
it O
gets O
cool O
, O
I O
put O
it O
on O
cold O
for O
me O
to O
feel O
and O
it O
was O
nice O
:) O
It O
dried O
my O
hair O
in O
a O
lot O
less O
time O
than O
most O
other O
blow O
dryers O
do O
and O
it O
comes O
with O
two O
removable O
nozzles O
so O
that O
you O
can O
dry O
your O
hair O
anyway O
you O
want O
to O
. O
I O
'm O
still O
stunned O
at O
how O
fast O
my O
hair O
dried O
. O
I O
have O
been O
through O
so O
many O
hair O
dryers O
and O
none O
of O
them O
came O
close O
to O
being O
this O
great O
! O
! O
I O
love O
the O
colors O
of O
it O
, O
the O
blue O
and O
black O
are O
perfect O
for O
me O
since O
that O
is O
my O
favorite O
colors:)I O
have O
long O
hair O
, O
not O
short O
so O
normally O
it O
really O
does O
take O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
. O
I O
'm O
in O
love O
with O
this O
blow O
dryer O
. O
I O
love O
that O
you O
have O
the O
choice O
of O
the O
colors O
, O
they O
are O
both O
really O
nice O
looking O
. O
This O
is O
such O
a O
amazing O
price O
for O
such O
a O
awesome O
hair O
dryer O
! O
! O
! O
I O
will O
end O
up O
buying O
another O
one O
just O
for O
my O
daughter O
to O
have O
, O
so O
she O
leaves O
mine O
alone:)I O
received O
this O
at O
little O
or O
at O
no O
cost O
to O
review O
and O
to O
give O
my O
unbias O
opinion O
and O
that O
is O
exactly O
what O
I O
have O
done O
. O
I O
wish O
I O
could O
take O
a O
picture O
, O
but O
the O
picture O
posted O
is O
exactly O
what O
it O
looks O
like O
:) O

Not O
as O
powerful O
on O
lower O
power O

Heavy O
, O
bad O
temperature O
and O
flow O
control O
. O
It O
is O
not O
handy O
at O
all O
. O
Bay O
Bliss O
hair O
dryer O
is O
much O
better O
and O
smaller O
. O

We O
actually O
bought O
this O
for O
drying O
the O
dog O
after O
his O
baths O
. O
He O
likes O
it O
a O
lot O
better O
than O
the O
others O
because O
it O
is O
much O
quieter O
on O
the O
low O
speed O
than O
what O
we O
used O
before O
. O
If O
you O
are O
in O
a O
hurry O
though O
, O
the O
high O
setting O
blows O
a O
lot O
of O
air O
, O
just O
not O
quite O
as O
much O
as O
your O
typical O
politician O
. O

For O
the O
price O
this O
is O
a O
good O
drier O
. O
It O
did O
get O
a O
little O
heavy O
while O
I O
was O
drying O
my O
hair O
. O
But O
I O
did O
think O
my O
hair O
looked O
shinier O
after O
. O
I O
would O
not O
call O
it O
professional O
quality O
by O
any O
means O
. O
I O
would O
say O
it O
is O
worth O
it O
if O
you O
're O
just O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
cheap O
hair O
dryer O
. O

Why O
was O
n't O
I O
using O
a O
remington O
before O
. O
These O
are O
way O
better O
than O
the O
one O
I O
was O
using O
before O
from O
Revlon.10 O
stars O
. O

This O
works O
good O
, O
but O
not O
as O
good O
as O
my O
old O
one O
that O
I O
got O
at O
Walmart O
for O
$ O
15.00 O
. O
  O
It O
's O
a O
little O
heavy O
and O
somewhat O
bulky O
but O
I O
like O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
cord O
recoils O
inside O
. O
  O
It O
keeps O
it O
out O
of O
the O
way O
, O
but O
the O
cord O
is O
not O
very O
long O
so O
you O
must O
stay O
close O
to O
the O
outlet O
. O
  O
I O
have O
very O
long O
hair O
and O
my O
old O
blow O
dryer O
dries O
my O
hair O
a O
lot O
faster O
than O
this O
one O
does O
. O
I O
had O
no O
need O
for O
the O
attachements O
so O
I O
tossed O
them O
in O
the O
trash O
. O
  O
It O
works O
OK O
, O
nothing O
to O
write O
home O
about O
. O

Picked O
this O
out O
after O
using O
it O
in O
a O
hotel O
. O
I O
've O
had O
it O
in O
3 O
or O
4 O
hotels O
since O
then O
. O
It O
has O
a O
Medium O
speed O
which O
is O
rare O
, O
and O
the O
Cool O
setting O
, O
which O
I O
love O
. O
And O
it O
was O
reasonably O
priced O
! O

love O
it O

This O
hair O
dryer O
works O
well O
, O
dries O
my O
hair O
quicker O
than O
others O
I O
've O
used O
in O
the O
past O
. O
My O
only O
complaint O
is O
the O
weight O
, O
could O
be O
lighter O
. O

Very O
nice O
and O
lighter O
weight O
than O
previous O
models O
. O
  O
Dries O
well O
. O

A O
very O
good O
value O
for O
the O
money O
. O
  O
The O
on O
/ O
off O
switch O
is O
a O
little O
hard O
for O
arthritic O
hands O
to O
use O
, O
but O
not O
a O
deal O
breaker O
. O
  O
Dries O
my O
wifes O
curly O
hair O
very O
quickly O
. O

This O
hairdryer O
is O
a O
definite O
upgrade O
from O
my O
old O
Conair O
one O
. O
  O
It O
is O
fast O
, O
and O
seems O
to O
leave O
my O
hair O
nice O
and O
shiny O
. O
My O
hair O
still O
seems O
a O
bit O
frizzy O
on O
top O
, O
but O
that O
could O
just O
be O
my O
hair O
or O
that O
fact O
that O
I O
live O
in O
a O
very O
humid O
climate O
. O
  O
The O
volume O
is O
pretty O
good O
. O
  O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
I O
would O
necessarily O
call O
it O
quiet O
though O
. O
The O
weight O
is O
also O
decent O
, O
but O
I O
would O
not O
say O
it O
is O
extremely O
light O
or O
anything O
. O
I O
read O
on O
at O
least O
one O
of O
the O
other O
reviews O
that O
the O
power O
cord O
was O
just O
a O
regualr O
plug O
, O
but O
mine O
was O
one O
of O
those O
safety O
kinds O
. O
  O
Overall O
, O
it O
is O
a O
great O
hairdryer O
for O
the O
price O
! O

Love O
this O
blowdryer- O
do O
n't O
like O
how O
the O
nozzle O
on O
the O
front O
pops O
off O
on O
it O
's O
own O
, O
but O
it O
has O
reduced O
frizz O
. O

Quality O
hair O
dryer O
, O
this O
really O
moves O
some O
air O
. O

Great O
product O
, O
looks O
and O
preformance O
. O

When O
we O
got O
this O
hair O
dryer O
we O
wanted O
one O
that O
would O
n't O
cause O
fly O
away O
hair O
. O
This O
certainly O
lives O
up O
to O
the O
claims O
. O
Also O
this O
dryer O
has O
individual O
controls O
for O
speed O
and O
heat O
. O
I O
really O
like O
that O
, O
because O
most O
of O
the O
time O
I O
do O
n't O
need O
high O
heat O
but O
do O
want O
more O
blowing O
power O
. O
It O
also O
is O
n't O
very O
noisy O
as O
far O
as O
hair O
dryers O
go O
. O

I O
returned O
it O
. O

It O
works O
great O
. O

these O
dryers O
are O
the O
best O
, O
last O
forever O

Powerful O
hair O
dryer O
-- O
adding O
volume O
to O
your O
hair O
. O
The O
hot O
mode O
could O
be O
super O
hot O
so O
you O
get O
to O
be O
careful O
. O

Best O
blow O
dry O
ever O
, O
I O
have O
been O
buying O
these O
for O
years O
.. O

Good O
product O
for O
an O
amazing O
price O
! O

Great O
hair O
dryer O
. O
Dries O
my O
hair O
great O
for O
thick O
hair O
. O

Love O
it O
. O
Perfect O
for O
travelling O
! O
I O
used O
this O
when O
I O
went O
to O
Norway O
last O
spring O
. O
Not O
only O
did O
it O
work O
well O
with O
the O
converter O
, O
it O
was O
also O
very O
high O
powered O
for O
such O
a O
small O
dryer O
. O

I O
had O
2 O
originals O
of O
these O
hair O
dryers O
they O
worked O
great O
for O
years O
. O
  O
I O
still O
have O
one O
but O
one O
the O
other O
one O
broke O
I O
reordered O
this O
one O
must O
have O
cheaper O
parts O
it O
completely O
broke O
in O
5 O
months O

I O
had O
a O
cord O
keeper O
for O
years O
. O
  O
This O
is O
a O
nice O
hair O
dryer O
with O
all O
the O
options O
and O
attachments O
I O
need O
. O
  O
It O
is O
a O
bit O
larger O
than O
my O
older O
version O
. O
  O
I O
will O
keep O
looking O
for O
one O
that O
is O
lighter O
weight O
and O
smaller O
. O
  O
I O
really O
, O
really O
liked O
my O
older O
one O
. O

Have O
it O
mounted O
in O
the O
not O
quite O
finished O
bathroom O
yet O
. O
  O
Looks O
good O
so O
far O
- O
But O
have O
n't O
used O
it O
yet O
. O

This O
is O
my O
second O
time O
buying O
this O
hair O
blower O
. O
I O
love O
it O
so O
much O
! O

it O
does O
n't O
work O
when O
I O
plugged O
it O
in O
it O
did O
n't O
work O
how O
do O
I O
return O
it O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
replacement O
for O
my O
old O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
All O
3 O
attachments O
work O
great O
for O
however O
I O
want O
to O
style O
my O
hair O
. O
  O
This O
dryer O
motor O
is O
occasionally O
  O
makes O
a O
loud O
grinding O
sound O
but O
it O
continues O
to O
work O
. O

works O
great O
. O

The O
biggest O
waste O
of O
money O
I O
've O
ever O
spent O
. O
This O
drier O
has O
to O
be O
a O
fake O
t3 O
because O
I O
've O
used O
a O
t3 O
for O
many O
years O
and O
loved O
it O
. O
This O
drier O
however O
gets O
hot O
enough O
, O
but O
there O
's O
absolutely O
no O
power O
behind O
it O
to O
blow O
dry O
the O
hair O
. O
Essentially O
it O
's O
just O
barely O
blowing O
while O
heating O
up O
my O
hair O
. O
My O
hair O
takes O
forever O
to O
dry O
with O
this O
thing O
and O
after O
its O
finally O
dry O
it O
's O
a O
frizzy O
mess O
. O
This O
company O
seems O
dishonest O
as O
well O
because O
in O
the O
box O
there O
was O
a O
large O
piece O
of O
paper O
stating O
that O
they O
'll O
give O
a O
lifetime O
warranty O
if O
I O
give O
a O
good O
review O
! O
So O
they O
're O
not O
standing O
by O
their O
product O
but O
instead O
they O
're O
essentially O
trying O
to O
pay O
me O
to O
lie O
! O
I O
'm O
sorry O
, O
but O
I O
have O
to O
be O
honest O
and O
the O
drier O
is O
a O
piece O
of O
junk O
. O

This O
dryer O
is O
fantastic O
. O
Hair O
is O
silky O
and O
smooth O
when O
dry O
and O
if O
you O
purchase O
the O
attachment O
it O
does O
a O
good O
job O
of O
straightening O
hair O
while O
drying O
it O
. O
I O
would O
purchase O
again O
. O

DO O
NOT O
BUY O
! O
Lasted O
1 O

the O
time O
to O
order O
this O
product O
. O

I O
travel O
frequently O
and O
love O
this O
hairdryer O
because O
the O
dual O
voltage O
allows O
me O
to O
use O
it O
anywhere O
and O
it O
is O
light O
to O
handle O
and O
small O
to O
pack O
in O
my O
luggage O
. O

Does O
the O
job O
. O
Dries O
my O
hair O
. O
Not O
fast O
, O
but O
it O
also O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
make O
my O
hair O
like O
a O
burnt O
crisp O
. O
So O
, O
all O
good O
. O

It O
's O
an O
ok O
drier O
but O
there O
are O
so O
many O
better O
options O
out O
there O
with O
a O
stronger O
motor O
. O
The O
airflow O
is O
weak O
even O
on O
the O
highest O
setting O
. O
It O
says O
its O
a O
1875w O
drier O
but O
it O
dries O
the O
hair O
more O
like O
a O
1200w O
one O
. O
Also O
it O
is O
quite O
bulky O
. O
It O
does O
reduce O
frizz O
and O
improve O
the O
shine O
. O
I O
recommend O
it O
to O
a O
person O
with O
short O
and O
fine O
hair O
. O
If O
you O
have O
coarse O
or O
curly O
hair O
, O
I O
would O
n't O
pick O
this O
one O
. O

Arrived O
ahead O
of O
schedule O
, O
good O
price O
. O

Small O
, O
easy O
to O
mount O
. O
  O
Does O
the O
job O

just O
what O
we O
wanted O
. O
size O
is O
great O
and O
very O
compact O
. O

Love O
it O
and O
use O
it O
daily O
. O
  O
So O
convenient O
. O

Where O
has O
this O
been O
my O
whole O
life O
? O
! O
? O
? O
This O
is O
honestly O
the O
best O
hair O
dryer O
ever O
. O

Great O
product O
I O
read O
reviews O
so O
kept O
my O
unit O
on O
low O
! O
Wow O
! O
  O
Low O
gets O
really O
hot O
so O
it O
does O
the O
job O
so O
far O
woo O
hoo O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O

Bought O
this O
item O
twice O
. O
The O
first O
unit O
lasted O
about O
two O
years O
which O
I O
thought O
was O
a O
bit O
short O
but O
it O
was O
convenient O
, O
worked O
well O
and O
seemed O
worth O
a O
second O
try O
. O
Maybe O
the O
one O
I O
got O
just O
was O
not O
a O
good O
one O
. O
Our O
use O
was O
far O
from O
excessive O
. O
It O
was O
mounted O
in O
a O
master O
bath O
where O
only O
my O
wife O
and O
I O
used O
it O
. O
We O
both O
have O
short O
hair O
. O
The O
second O
unit O
I O
purchased O
had O
an O
additional O
issue O
. O
Though O
the O
price O
was O
about O
the O
same O
, O
the O
cord O
from O
the O
unit O
base O
to O
the O
wall O
outlet O
was O
significantly O
shorter O
than O
on O
the O
first O
. O
I O
guess O
they O
saved O
a O
few O
bucks O
by O
providing O
a O
shorter O
outlet O
cord O
( O
now O
about O
2 O
- O
3 O
fee)t O
. O
I O
accommodated O
this O
though O
the O
wall O
setup O
did O
not O
look O
as O
tidy O
as O
the O
first O
unit O
as O
I O
did O
not O
have O
a O
long O
enough O
cord O
to O
reach O
the O
outlet O
. O
The O
bigger O
concern O
is O
that O
2 O
years O
later O
it O
stopped O
functioning O
again O
. O
Rather O
than O
buy O
another O
wall O
mounted O
unit O
, O
I O
bought O
an O
aluminum O
generic O
hair O
dryer O
wall O
mount O
  O
and O
purchased O
an O
inexpensive O
hair O
dryer O
than O
I O
can O
easily O
replace O
in O
the O
future O
as O
the O
need O
arises O
. O

Very O
good O
. O
Pleasantly O
surprise O

This O
dryer O
is O
awesome O
, O
the O
accessory O
allows O
me O
to O
pinpoint O
a O
section O
of O
hair O
for O
styling O
/ O
drying O
purposes O
and O
has O
a O
cool O
setting O
which O
sets O
the O
style O
in O
place O
, O
handle O
does O
not O
fold O
in O
but O
luckily O
I O
have O
drawer O
space O
. O

Excellent O
! O

excellent O
product O
, O
very O
good O
at O
relationship O
between O
Quality O
vs O
Price O
, O
recommended O
100 O
% O

is O
kind O
of O
different O
to O
the O
picture O
one O
, O
but O
the O
stylish O
on O
my O
hair O
it O
was O
as O
expected O

Very O
powerful O
for O
such O
a O
small O
blow O
dryer O
. O

I O
gave O
it O
one O
star O
because O
there O
are O
none O
lower O
. O
  O
It O
did O
not O
work O
in O
Israel O
even O
though O
we O
had O
top O
of O
the O
line O
converters O
. O
  O
In O
America O
, O
it O
was O
wimpy O
and O
hard O
to O
hold O
. O
  O
The O
voltage O
switcher O
on O
the O
dryer O
did O
not O
really O
exist O
. O
  O
Find O
another O
one O
. O

Good O

Great O
hairdryer O

Powerful O
but O
not O
too O
heavy O
and O
bulky O

Like O

very O
much O

Great O
hairdryer O
and O
very O
quiet O
! O

Broke O
after O
2 O
uses O
. O
But O
It O
could O
nt O
be O
returned O
because O
I O
was O
in O
a O
different O
country O

So O
far O
, O
I O
like O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
It O
is O
very O
strong O
and O
has O
really O
helped O
cut O
down O
on O
my O
dry O
time O
. O

A O
gift O
no O
feedback O
from O

Great O

good O
thing O

  O
This O

annnd O
my O

decided O
to O
use O
it O
to O
take O
decals O
off O
our O
truck O
.... O
he O
used O
it O
for O
4 O
hrs O
straight O
on O
high O
heat O
and O
i O
was O
a O
bit O
nervous O
it O
would O
die O
out O
on O
me O
pretty O
quick O
afterward O
but O
its O
4 O
mos O
later O
and O
still O
as O
good O
as O
when O
i O
bought O
it O
! O
! O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
product O
! O
! O

This O
was O
a O
birthday O
present O
for O
my O
long O
- O
haired O
daughter O
and O
she O
loves O
it O
. O

It O
dries O
your O
hair O
. O
Not O
much O
else O
to O
say O
. O

I O
had O
this O
blow O
dryer O
before O
but O
i O
dropped O
it O
had O
to O
get O
another O
one O
. O
And O
i O
luv O
it O

My O
wife O
like O
the O
power O
and O
size O
. O
  O
I O
think O
it O
is O
a O
bit O
loud O
. O
  O
Easy O
to O
mount O
and O
it O
does O
n't O
take O
up O
much O
space O
. O

Great O
power O
. O
  O
I O
should O
n't O
have O
waited O
so O
long O
to O
purchase O
it O
. O
  O
Dries O
hair O
more O
quickly O
than O
any O
other O
dryer O
- O
by O
far O
! O
  O
Worth O
the O
extra O
money O
. O

My O
previous O
dryer O
finally O
died O
. O
  O
I O
really O
like O
this O
one O
. O
  O
It O
does O
n't O
collapse O
, O
but O
that O
was O
one O
of O
the O
breaking O
points O
on O
my O
previous O
one O
. O
  O
I O
like O
the O
  O
variation O
in O
temperatures O
& O
speed O
. O
  O
I O
took O
off O
the O
nozzle O
because O
it O
seemed O
to O
concentrate O
the O
air O
too O
much O
... O
I O
do O
n't O
really O
like O
to O
spend O
too O
much O
time O
on O
my O
hair O
, O
just O
the O
minimum O
to O
make O
it O
look O
good O
. O
  O
The O
diffuser O
seems O
pretty O
good O
, O
but O
I O
have O
n't O
tried O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
curly O
yet O
. O
  O
I O
really O
like O
that O
the O
back O
vent O
can O
be O
cleaned O
. O

Great O
blow O
dryer O
definitely O
better O
then O
I O
was O
expecting O

Bought O
for O
a O
present O
.. O
was O
well O
liked O
! O

Great O
for O
traveling O
. O
It O
takes O
up O
very O
little O
space O
and O
weighs O
next O
to O
nothing O
! O

I O
decided O
to O
purchase O
this O
hair O
dryer O
after O
using O
it O
during O
a O
recent O
hotel O
stay O
. O
  O
I O
was O
drawn O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
does O
not O
emanate O
the O
same O
high O
- O
pitched O
tone O
that O
my O
prior O
Conair O
makes O
( O
which O
is O
also O
an O
1875 O
but O
has O
added O
features O
such O
as O
cool O
air O
and O
turbo O
settings O
) O
. O
  O
I O
'm O
very O
happy O
with O
my O
purchase O
. O
  O
The O
hair O
dryer O
is O
VERY O
lightweight O
, O
cheap O
, O
and O
hot O
enough O
to O
get O
the O
job O
done O
. O
  O
Most O
importantly O
to O
me O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
feel O
like O
I O
'm O
damaging O
my O
hearing O
when O
I O
use O
it O
. O
  O
I O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

Excellent O
dryer O
for O
the O
price O
! O
I O
've O
owned O
Hot O
Tools O
and O
other O
Conair O
dryers O
in O
the O
past O
, O
and O
so O
far O
this O
one O
has O
been O
the O
best O
. O
I O
bought O
this O
one O
to O
replace O
my O
older O
model O
Conair O
dryer O
that O
went O
out O
after O
4 O
years O
of O
use O
. O
I O
really O
like O
that O
this O
one O
has O
the O
switch O
for O
the O
cool O
setting O
, O
rather O
than O
having O
to O
hold O
the O
blue O
button O
to O
get O
the O
cold O
blast O
( O
although O
it O
still O
has O
that O
button O
as O
an O
option O
) O
. O
It O
's O
not O
as O
quiet O
as O
my O
last O
dryer O
, O
but O
my O
hair O
gets O
dryer O
faster O
without O
drying O
out O
the O
ends O
or O
creating O
static O
. O
My O
hair O
actually O
looks O
more O
shiny O
/ O
silky O
after O
using O
this O
one O
than O
it O
did O
with O
the O
older O
model O
. O

Excellent O
produce O

For O
the O
price O
, O
this O
is O
a O
great O
little O
hairdryer O
. O
  O
Folds O
nicely O
. O
  O
Wish O
it O
had O
a O
retractable O
cord O
, O
though O
. O

Nice O

Xtava O
Rimini O
1800w O
Iconic O
Hair O
Dryer O
with O
Diffuser O
is O
awesome O
! O
It O
's O
light O
weight O
, O
heats O
up O
quickly O
and O
works O
wonderfully O
. O
The O
diffuser O
helps O
keep O
hair O
frizz O
free O
and O
shiny O
, O
which O
is O
great O
. O
There O
are O
not O
only O
three O
heat O
levels O
, O
but O
two O
power O
levels O
, O
so O
there O
are O
loads O
of O
options O
to O
get O
the O
perfect O
setting O
for O
you!!I O
am O
thrilled O
to O
have O
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
review O
this O
Xtava O
Hair O
Dryer O
. O
All O
opinions O
are O
my O
own O
and O
not O
influenced O
in O
any O
way O
. O

Just O
wish O
the O
tube O
was O
longer O
. O
If O
your O
hair O
is O
too O
near O
the O
air O
intake O
, O
it O
sucks O
it O
in O
. O
Otherwise O
very O
good O
product O
. O

I O
was O
in O
desperate O
need O
of O
a O
new O
blow O
dryer O
but O
very O
hesitant O
to O
purchase O
because O
I O
have O
attempted O
twice O
over O
the O
years O
to O
get O
a O
new O
, O
updated O
one O
but O
both O
broke O
quickly O
and O
did O
n’t O
work O
as O
good O
as O
my O
15 O
year O
old O
blow O
dryer O
. O
The O
Xtava O
Rimini O
1500W O
Ionic O
Hair O
Dryer O
really O
surprised O
me O
. O
I O
mean O
, O
really O
. O
First O
, O
it O
is O
insanely O
lightweight O
( O
I O
think O
they O
say O
“ O
ultra O
- O
lightweight O
” O
) O
. O
There O
are O
3 O
heat O
levels O
and O
2 O
power O
levels O
and O
it O
comes O
with O
two O
attachments O
- O
a O
diffuser O
to O
help O
eliminate O
frizz O
and O
give O
more O
volume O
and O
a O
Concentrator O
Nozzle O
for O
focusing O
on O
just O
one O
area O
of O
your O
hair O
to O
dry O
that O
area O
more O
rapidly O
. O
Now O
, O
for O
how O
it O
performed O
- O
I O
have O
long O
, O
wavy O
, O
medium O
- O
thickness O
hair O
( O
and O
lots O
of O
it O
) O
that O
tends O
to O
get O
frizzy O
with O
heat O
products O
( O
so O
I O
limit O
them O
! O
) O
I O
generally O
spend O
35 O
- O
40 O
minutes O
to O
get O
this O
hair O
dried O
with O
a O
blow O
dryer O
. O
This O
, O
combined O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
was O
in O
a O
bad O
car O
accident O
and O
it O
can O
get O
really O
painful O
when O
I O
am O
styling O
my O
hair O
for O
so O
long O
means O
I O
throw O
mousse O
in O
and O
let O
it O
air O
- O
dry O
wavy O
/ O
curly O
more O
often O
than O
not O
. O
NOT O
ANYMORE O
. O
I O
LOVE O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
It O
took O
only O
20 O
minutes O
to O
completely O
dry O
my O
hair O
with O
the O
diffuser O
. O
And O
, O
my O
hair O
looked O
FABULOUS O
. O
It O
made O
my O
hair O
so O
smooth O
and O
soft O
and O
with O
no O
frizz O
! O
! O
! O
I O
did O
n’t O
need O
to O
use O
extra O
smoothing O
lotions O
or O
serums O
like O
I O
usually O
do O
! O
The O
cool O
shot O
button O
helps O
to O
“ O
set O
” O
the O
style O
and O
it O
also O
helps O
reduce O
frizz O
and O
boost O
shine O
( O
my O
old O
one O
did O
n’t O
have O
one O
of O
these!)I O
can O
not O
recommend O
this O
enough O
! O
I O
wish O
Amazon O

The O
best O
wall O
mounted O
dryer O
I O
've O
found O
! O
  O
I O
also O
love O
the O
little O
night O
light O
as O
it O
's O
enough O
to O
light O
my O
way O
to O
the O
bathroom O
at O
night O
! O

Way O
better O
than O
my O
previous O
dryer O
. O
I O
was O
cheap O
. O
I O
was O
trying O
to O
save O
money O
for O
a O
while O
... O
in O
the O
worst O
ways O
possible O
. O
I O
ended O
up O
buying O
this O
$ O
11 O
dryer O
because O
it O
was O
cheap O
. O
  O
And O
for O
a O
year O
, O
I O
went O
around O
with O
wet O
hair O
. O
I O
tried O
to O
tell O
myself O
that O
it O
was O
okay O
because O
of O
all O
the O
money O
I O
was O
saving O
. O
But O
it O
did O
not O
feel O
okay O
. O
I O
finally O
ended O
up O
getting O
this O
dryer O
though O
and O
it O
was O
like O
night O
and O
day O
. O
This O
dryer O
works O
so O
quickly O
. O
It O
makes O
you O
save O
time O
and O
time O
is O
the O
most O
precious O
resource O
of O
all O
. O
It O
will O
dry O
hair O
quickly O
and O
efficiently O
. O
  O
I O
do O
not O
use O
any O
of O
the O
attachments O
that O
come O
with O
it O
. O
But O
if O
you O
style O
your O
hair O
, O
just O
know O
, O
those O
are O
options O
too O
. O

Just O
with O
the O
bonnet O
was O
easier O
to O
fit O
over O
rollers O
. O
but O
otherwise O
a O
good O
machine O
. O

I O
love O
the O
item O
. O
It O
has O
become O
very O
much O
easier O
to O
dry O
my O
dreds O
. O
Thank O
you O
! O

I O
really O
like O
this O
little O
helper O
and O
bought O
a O
second O
one O
for O
a O
friend O
. O
I O
find O
that O
my O
travel O
sized O
hairdryer O
works O
best O
in O
this O
. O

The O
best O
dryer O
ever O
, O
I O
go O
through O
hair O
dryers O
like O
crazy O
, O
finally O
I O
have O
found O
one O
I O
love O
! O

Perfect O
size O
for O
travel O
but O
still O
really O
powerful O
. O

Good O

its O
super O
loud O
and O
kind O
of O
heavy O
. O
I O
do O
nt O
really O
know O
if O
i O
like O
it O
. O
Do O
nt O
recommend O

The O
voltage O
switch O
was O
broken O
... O
could O
not O
use O
it O
on O
my O
trip O
oversees O
. O
  O
Would O
not O
refund O
me O
because O
too O
much O
time O
had O
passed O
. O
Big O
rip O
off O

I O
had O
this O
hair O
dryer O
for O
approximately O
seven O
years O
before O
it O
finally O
broke O
. O
I O
never O
used O
any O
of O
the O
attachments O
so O
I O
ca O
n't O
comment O
on O
those O
, O
but O
the O
blow O
dryer O
itself O
worked O
great O
. O
What O
finally O
broke O
was O
actually O
the O
cord O
it O
seems O
. O
If O
you O
held O
the O
cord O
where O
it O
attached O
to O
the O
base O
at O
just O
the O
right O
angle O
it O
would O
work O
again O
, O
so O
the O
dryer O
itself O
was O
actually O
still O
kicking O
after O
7 O
years O
. O

Love O
this O
. O

my O
home O
use O
blower O
. O
works O
well O
! O

Looks O
and O
works O
great O

Girlfriend O
likes O
it O
. O
However O
, O
does O
n't O
feel O
as O
powerful O
as O
the O
previous O
version O

Drys O
my O
hair O
fast O
and O
effectively O
:) O

I O
love O
it O
, O
I O
have O
been O
trying O
to O
find O
one O
for O
two O
years O
. O

i O
had O
a O
professional O
hair O
dryer O
and O
it O
broke O
, O
i O
picked O
this O
one O
based O
on O
the O
reviews O
and O
the O
price O
and O
i O
love O
it O
. O
it O
takes O
me O
15 O
min O
to O
dry O
my O
medium O
hair O
and O
it O
does O
nt O
cause O
a O
lot O
of O
frizz O
. O

buen O
producto O

I O
like O
the O
silky O
feel O
this O
hair O
dryer O
gives O
my O
hair O
. O
  O
I O
bought O
the O
same O
kind O
to O
replace O
an O
old O
one O
. O

Great O
dryer O
, O
convenient O
wall O
access O

This O
dryer O
is O
hard O
to O
turn O
on O
and O
off O

Great O
for O
blowouts O
! O
! O
! O

As O
much O
as O
I O
hate O
to O
admit O
it O
, O
in O
conjunction O
with O
the O
Cricket O
Technique O
400 O
thermal O
brush O
, O
my O
hair O
is O
as O
closest O
to O
a O
salon O
blowout O
as O
I O
have O
ever O
gotten O
it O
! O
It O
feels O
light O
and O
airy O
like O
it O
does O
when O
I O
leave O
my O
hairdresser O
. O
It O
is O
relatively O
quiet O
, O
the O
design O
is O
very O
nice O
- O
I O
like O
the O
smoothness O
of O
the O
handle O
. O
Love O
that O
it O
comes O
with O
concentrator O
and O
diffuser O
as O
I O
use O
both O
since O
I O
have O
naturally O
curly O
curly O
hair O
! O
I O
am O
pleased O
with O
this O
and O
will O
update O
later O
if O
need O
be O
because O
I O
JUST O
received O
it O
in O
the O
mail O
today O
. O
I O
also O
have O
long O
hair O
and O
did O
n't O
have O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
back O
as O
some O
others O
have O
. O

I O
looooove O
looooove O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
It O
's O
lightweight O
and O
has O
cut O
my O
drying O
time O
in O
HALF O
! O

Best O
hairdryer O
ever O
! O

I O
had O
on O
of O
these O
for O
12 O
years O
. O
  O
It O
finally O
gave O
up O
the O
ghost O
. O
  O
Works O
perfectly O
and O
is O
so O
convenient O
to O
have O
right O
on O
the O
bathroom O
wall O
. O
  O
Added O
bonus O
- O
more O
wattage O
with O
the O
new O
one O
! O

I O
like O
the O
temperature O
settings O
of O
cool O
, O
warm O
and O
hot O
but O
would O
like O
this O
dryer O
more O
if O
the O
flow O
of O
air O
were O
stronger O
when O
set O
on O
high O
. O
  O
It O
seems O
to O
take O
longer O
for O
my O
hair O
to O
dry O
with O
this O
dryer O
. O

Amazing O

WORKS O
WELL O

This O
hair O
dryer O
works O
super O
well O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
find O
the O
sound O
level O
much O
different O
from O
other O
hair O
dryers O
as O
some O
have O
complained O
. O
I O
appreciate O
all O
of O
the O
different O
settings O
( O
3 O
heat O
settings O
, O
Hi O
/ O
Med O
/ O
Low O
power O
, O
and O
teh O
different O
Wattage O
rankings O
) O
. O
The O
concentrater O
actually O
stays O
on O
the O
dryer O
, O
which O
is O
not O
what O
I O
have O
experienced O
in O
the O
past O
. O
Also O
, O
the O
cord O
retraction O
is O
not O
perfect O
; O
it O
sometimes O
  O
leaves O
an O
extra O
6 O
inches O
out O
, O
but O
I O
actually O
find O
it O
better O
than O
other O
cord O
retraction O
models O
. O
Since O
it O
is O
a O
full O
size O
blow O
dryer O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
expect O
it O
to O
be O
compact O
and O
the O
additional O
cord O
is O
a O
non O
- O
issue O
for O
me O
. O
Glad O
I O
happened O
upon O
this O
model O
. O

I O
have O
had O
this O
blowdryer O
for O
about O
a O
year O
and O
it O
already O
died O
. O
  O
Ironically O
, O
it O
is O
the O
most O
expensive O
blow O
dryer O
I O
have O
ever O
bought O
and O
shortest O
life O
as O
well O
. O
  O
Disappointing O
... O

Best O
blowdryer O
ever O
. O
  O
This O
is O
my O
second O
T3 O
because O
the O
airline O
broke O
my O
first O
one O
pitching O
my O
luggage O
. O
Drys O
super O
fast O
and O
less O
damaging O
. O

Love O

just O
prefect O
for O
me O
. O

works O
, O
retractable O
cord O
is O
nice O

I O
have O
not O
had O
chance O
to O
use O
it O
allot O
, O
but O
so O
far O
so O
good O
:) O

Great O
dryer O
, O
just O
a O
little O
heavy O
and O
... O
the O
buttons O
are O
very O
flat O
, O
making O
it O
hard O
to O
slide O
on O
and O
off O
. O

So O
far O
works O
well O
! O

I O
purchased O
this O
for O
my O
vacation O
home O
. O
  O
I O
liked O
it O
so O
much O
I O
brought O
it O
home O
and O
took O
the O
more O
expensive O
dryer O
I O
was O
using O
at O
home O
to O
my O
vacation O
home O
. O

As O
advertised O
, O
works O
great O
MUCH O
faster O
than O
my O
precious O
dryer O
. O
The O
buttons O
on O
the O
handle O
are O
a O
bit O
awkward O
but O
I O
'll O
get O
used O
to O
it O
. O

  O

Cons O
: O
Too O
big O
to O
be O
a O
good O
travel O
dryer O
Not O
very O
powerful O
, O
even O
on O
the O
highest O
setting O
Takes O
a O
long O
time O
to O
dry O
my O
hair O
, O
and O
it O
' O
  O
s O
super O
short O
Does O
not O
seem O
very O
sturdy O
  O
Pros O
: O
Relatively O
quiet O
Decreases O
frizz O

This O
unit O
began O
to O
self O
destruct O
this O
morning O
discharging O
internal O
shrapnal O
and O
vibrating O
while O
releasing O
a O
death O
sound O
. O
Despite O
being O
treated O
with O
the O
utmost O
respect O
it O
will O
join O
the O
pile O
of O
cheap O
Chinese O
junk O
I O
have O
accumulated O
over O
the O
yearsIt O
almost O
made O
it O
to O
it O
's O
second O
birthday O
. O
PitifulI O
purchased O
a O
Panasonic O
and O
a O
seperate O
wall O
bracket O
as O
a O
replacementIt O
is O
most O
likely O
chinese O
made O
as O
well O
but O
the O
design O
should O
long O
outlast O
generics O

I O
amd O
black O
and O
I O
have O
natural O
hair O
and O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
this O
blowdryer O
will O
be O
perfect O
for O
anyone O
! O

I O
got O
this O
and O
was O
excited O
because O
of O
the O
reviews O
. O
It O
does O
dry O
my O
hair O
but O
takes O
longer O
than O
my O
drugstore O
dryer O
, O
but O
might O
be O
healthier O
. O
The O
attachments O
do O
NOT O
stay O
on O
making O
them O
almost O
useless O
. O
I O
tried O
to O
return O
it O
but O
my O
husband O
threw O
away O
the O
box O
, O
so O
I O
'm O
stuck O
. O
I O
can O
say O
it O
's O
pretty O
and O
I O
like O
the O
cool O
shot O
, O
but O
it O
does O
NOT O
lock O
as O
described O
.... O
you O
have O
to O
hold O
it O
down O
the O
whole O
time O
. O
Also O
, O
the O
plug O
is O
too O
narrow O
. O
It O
keeps O
coming O
unplugged O
because O
it O
's O
too O
loose O
. O
It O
's O
easy O
to O
accidentally O
change O
settings O
or O
turn O
it O
off O
when O
in O
use O
because O
of O
button O
placement O
, O
but O
starting O
to O
get O
use O
to O
it O
. O

NO O
complaint O
. O
It O
is O
very O
powerful O
for O
the O
size O
. O

Was O
great O
while O
it O
lasted O
, O
but O
the O
first O
time O
I O
tripped O
over O
the O
cord O
it O
toppled O
over O
and O
never O
worked O
again O
... O
and O
it O
had O
been O
90 O
days O
, O
so O
no O
refund O
or O
exchange O
. O

This O
hairdryer O
is O
great O
! O
  O
It O
has O
3 O
choices O
of O
speed O
and O
3 O
heat O
settings O
, O
cool O
, O
warm O
and O
hot O
. O
  O
This O
is O
the O
best O
hairdryer O
I O
've O
ever O
had O
! O
! O

It O
's O
a O
hair O
dryer O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
horrible O
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O
spectacular O
, O
not O
like O
some O
of O
the O
other O
Xtava O
products O
I O
have O
used O
in O
the O
past O
. O
It O
does O
n't O
look O
it O
, O
but O
it O
is O
lightweight O
and O
it O
's O
a O
really O
nice O
color O
blue O
. O
It O
comes O
with O
two O
attachments O
; O
a O
big O
customized O
diffuser O
and O
a O
concentrated O
nozzle O
for O
targeting O
styling O
. O
The O
diffuser O
was O
a O
little O
difficult O
to O
get O
on O
. O
It O
did O
n't O
fit O
as O
good O
as O
the O
concentrated O
nozzle O
. O
I O
also O
liked O
that O
it O
has O
a O
long O
cord O
which O
made O
it O
easier O
for O
me O
to O
move O
around O
when O
needed O
. O
This O
Rimini O
hair O
dryer O
comes O
with O
three O
heat O
levels O
, O
two O
power O
levels O
and O
a O
cool O
shot O
button O
to O
set O
your O
style O
. O
The O
different O
settings O
and O
attachments O
did O
make O
it O
easier O
when O
styling O
my O
hair O
. O
I O
could O
set O
them O
to O
what O
ever O
I O
needed O
them O
to O
be O
, O
when O
I O
needed O
them O
. O
I O
've O
never O
uses O
such O
a O
big O
diffuser O
like O
this O
before O
. O
It O
did O
dry O
my O
hair O
quickly O
, O
but O
I O
have O
very O
fine O
hair O
, O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
need O
a O
lot O
of O
heat O
. O
It O
did O
help O
with O
the O
frizz O
and O
left O
my O
hair O
feeling O
smooth O
. O
I O
felt O
that O
it O
could O
have O
had O
a O
bit O
more O
power O
to O
it O
, O
but O
it O
was O
okay O
. O
For O
people O
with O
thicker O
hair O
, O
it O
might O
take O
a O
little O
longer O
to O
dry O
. O
Overall O
, O
this O
hair O
dryer O
was O
not O
bad O
, O
it O
does O
what O
a O
hair O
dryer O
is O
suppose O
to O
do O
and O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
. O
It O
's O
very O
easy O
to O
use O
and O
with O
all O
the O
different O
settings O
and O
attachments O
, O
it O
's O
convenient O
too O
. O

i O
like O

This O
blow O
dryer O
is O
the O
first O
I O
have O
owned O
that O
truly O
fits O
my O
needs O
. O
I O
have O
very O
, O
VERY O
curly O
hair O
so O
I O
am O
always O
looking O
for O
ways O
and O
tools O
that O
maky O
hair O
maintenance O
easier O
. O
This O
blow O
dryer O
works O
magic O
on O
my O
hair O
. O
It O
straightens O
it O
so O
fast O
which O
really O
saves O
me O
on O
time O
. O
I O
have O
small O
hands O
so O
the O
way O
this O
dryer O
is O
shaped O
makes O
it O
easy O
to O
hold O
and O
use O
. O
It O
is O
n't O
very O
heavy O
which O
adds O
to O
its O
ease O
of O
use O
. O
Out O
of O
the O
three O
attachments O
, O
I O
use O
the O
big O
comb O
right O
after O
washing O
my O
hair O
and O
the O
small O
comb O
for O
touch O
ups O
. O
I O
would O
say O
without O
a O
good O
thermal O
balm O
, O
heat O
protectant O
, O
etc O
... O
It O
make O
be O
a O
little O
freezy O
. O
Since O
my O
hair O
is O
so O
curly O
, O
I O
am O
uses O
to O
using O
such O
products O
so O
if O
you O
do O
nt O
, O
you O
may O
want O
to O
. O
The O
heat O
dial O
only O
has O
3 O
ranges O
which O
I O
thought O
would O
be O
an O
issue O
. O
I O
would O
say O
medium O
is O
good O
for O
most O
people O
. O
I O
have O
never O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
not O
getting O
the O
right O
temperature O
for O
my O
needs O
. O
Overall O
, O
I O
am O
happy O
with O
my O
purchase O
. O
It O
does O
nt O
break O
the O
bank O
yet O
works O
better O
than O
any O
other O
blow O
dryer O
I O
have O
had O
. O
It O
saves O
me O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
because O
of O
how O
good O
of O
a O
job O
it O
does O
. O
I O
would O
consider O
this O
a O
must O
buy O
. O

Arrived O
when O
it O
was O
supposed O
to O
. O
Dries O
my O
hair O
super O
fast O
. O
Nice O
feel O
to O
the O
dryer O
. O
Great O
price O
. O
What O
more O
can O
you O
ask O
for O
? O

In O
the O
beginning O
things O
were O
fine O
, O
I O
just O
started O
using O
it O
  O
2weeks O
ago O
even O
though O
I O
bought O
it O
months O
ago O
. O
With O
2week(3 O
times O
a O
week O
) O
of O
use O
the O
thing O
has O
already O
died O
on O
me O
. O
This O
is O
not O
something O
, O
I O
would O
buy O
again O
. O
It O
did O
n't O
flat O
out O
die O
, O
it O
started O
declining O
in O
performance O
. O

Dries O
my O
hair O
fast O

I O
needed O
a O
new O
hair O
dryer O
as O
my O
girlfriend O
borrowed O
my O
BaByliss O
Pro O
TT O
. O
  O
The O
Remington O
works O
great O
. O
  O
Everything O
works O
as O
it O
should O
and O
it O
puts O
out O
a O
bunch O
of O
air O
and O
cools O
down O
quickly O
when O
you O
are O
through O
using O
it O
. O
  O
Easy O
to O
regulate O
the O
temperature O
and O
the O
unit O
has O
great O
fit O
and O
finish O
. O
  O
The O
one O
item O
worth O
noting O
is O
that O
the O
Remington O
is O
about O
a O
quarter O
pound O
heavier O
than O
the O
BaByliss O
which O
may O
be O
an O
issue O
if O
you O
use O
it O
for O
long O
periods O
of O
time O
. O
  O
I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
hair O
dryer O
. O

Pretty O
design O
, O
however O
I O
did O
n't O
notice O
any O
difference O
in O
lack O
of O
frizz O
or O
shine O
that O
is O
associated O
with O
Ionic O
dryers O
. O

Very O
well O
made O
. O
Ergonomics O
is O
perfect O
. O
It O
has O
a O
dust O
filter O
that O
you O
can O
remove O
and O
clean O
out O
. O
The O
plug O
has O
a O
breaker O
switch O
. O
The O
main O
power O
switch O
is O
in O
the O
handle O
. O
This O
dryer O
can O
be O
used O
in O
a O
salon O
setting O
. O

Just O
pyrchased O
this O
, O
but O
it O
works O
well O
. O
  O
Low O
is O
hot O
enough O
for O
thin O
hair O
. O
  O
Med O
is O
hor O
and O
Hot O
is O
super O
hot O
! O
  O
My O
old O
dryer O
similar O
to O
this O
lasted O
years O
. O
  O
We O
'll O
see O
about O
this O
one O
. O

Great O

Love O
the O
diverse O
settings O
! O
Does O
a O
great O
job O
of O
drying O
my O
thick O
hair O
quicker O
than O
other O
dryers O
I O
have O
tried O
. O

I O
am O
extremely O
happy O
that O
I O
purchased O
this O
hair O
dryer O
! O
  O
I O
have O
lots O
of O
fine O
hair O
and O
it O
dries O
my O
hair O
in O
about O
30 O
- O
35 O
minutes O
. O
  O
It O
does O
get O
pretty O
hot O
so O
I O
suggest O
a O
setting O
around O
50 O
– O
55 O
. O
  O
It O
’s O
very O
top O
heavy O
so O
heed O
the O
directions O
and O
secure O
it O
somehow O
. O
  O
I O
do O
have O
to O
say O
, O
the O
first O
thing O
my O
husband O
said O
when O
he O
saw O
it O
was O
“ O
are O
you O
going O
to O
the O
moon O
? O
” O
– O
as O
it O
does O
look O
like O
a O
space O
helmet O
. O
  O
The O
directions O
are O
not O
very O
clear O
but O
I O
managed O
to O
put O
it O
together O
just O
fine O
by O
myself O
and O
it O
’s O
very O
sturdy O
. O
  O
I O
definitely O
would O
recommend O
this O
dryer O
. O

Dries O
my O
extremely O
thick O
, O
long O
hair O
quickly O
. O
  O
I O
use O
leave O
- O
in O
conditioner O
, O
brush O
out O
with O
my O
Wet O
Brush O
and O
then O
use O
the O
comb O
attachment O
to O
dry O
. O
  O
It O
takes O
& O
# O
60;10 O
min O
. O
  O
This O
is O
unheard O
of O
for O
me O
. O
  O
Its O
also O
fairly O
quiet O
. O
  O
My O
friends O
are O
sick O
or O
hearing O
about O
it O
so O
, O
I O
thought O
I O
'd O
tell O
Amazonians O
... O
I O
really O
love O
this O
hair O
dryer O
! O

This O
is O
a O
good O
hair O
dryer O
. O
  O
It O
's O
the O
4th O
one O
that O
I O
've O
bought O
over O
several O
years O
. O

Excellent O
. O
Small O
. O
No O
negatives O
. O

I O
love O
that O
this O
comes O
with O
a O
little O
diffuser O
. O
For O
a O
little O
guy O
, O
it O
does O
a O
very O
good O
job O
. O

exec O

The O
hair O
dryer O
is O
soooo O
light O
and O
can O
dry O
my O
medium O
to O
heavy O
hair O
in O
about O
5 O
minutes O
. O
  O
The O
only O
negative O
is O
that O
it O
is O
kind O
of O
large O
and O
difficult O
to O
store O
, O
but O
besides O
that O
, O
I O
'd O
definitely O
recommend O
it O
! O

Second O
one O
i O
purchased O
for O
wife O
and O
daughter O

Very O
compact O
, O
easy O
for O
travel O
packing O
, O
and O
works O
very O
well O
. O
For O
such O
  O
a O
small O
dryer O
, O
it O
packs O
a O
lot O
of O
power O
, O
and O
barely O
takes O
much O
longer O
than O
my O
full O
size O
dryer O
, O
to O
to O
it O
's O
job O
. O
Folds O
, O
and O
takes O
up O
1/3 O
the O
space O
though O
, O
and O
comes O
with O
a O
cute O
case O
, O
and O
2 O
attachments O

Great O
dryer O
except O
that O
the O
retractable O
cord O
stops O
completely O
retracting O
. O
  O
I O
replaced O
the O
first O
one O
under O
warranty O
after O
about O
9 O
months O
. O
  O
Within O
about O
another O
9 O
months O
the O
second O
dryer O
's O
retractable O
cord O
would O
not O
retract O
completely O
. O
  O
I O
followed O
the O
directions O
as O
to O
how O
to O
retract O
the O
cord O
. O
  O
The O
warranty O
only O
covers O
12 O
months O
from O
original O
purchase O
date O
so O
I O
am O
now O
out O
of O
luck O

I O
was O
a O
little O
disappointed O
. O
It O
takes O
a O
little O
longer O
to O
dry O
instead O
of O
the O
faster O
way O
the O
review O
mentioned O
. O
It O
is O
also O
not O
as O
hot O
as O
my O
regular O
cheaper O
blower O
. O

Works O
like O
it O
should O
. O

Looks O
great O
, O
works O
great O
, O
cord O
is O
n't O
too O
short O
( O
a O
pet O
peeve O
) O
, O
and O
I O
love O
that O
it O
has O
more O
than O
2 O
settings O
like O
many O
dryers O
these O
days O
. O
I O
can O
even O
give O
my O
dogs O
a O
little O
help O
drying O
off O
in O
the O
winter O
since O
I O
can O
change O
up O
the O
settings O
the O
moment O
it O
's O
a O
bit O
too O
hot O
or O
cool O
without O
going O
too O
far O
the O
opposite O
direction O
. O
Really O
liking O
the O
product O
so O
far O
. O

I O
only O
used O
once O
a O
day O
, O
& O
it O
got O
burned O
out O
. O
I O

attention O
to O
the O
bad O
reviews O
which O
they O
were O
saying O
the O
thruth O

seems O
quieter O
but O

First O
Amazon O
Review O
... O
So O
I O
bought O
this O
hair O
dryer O
as O
my O
main O
hairdryer O
at O
home O
. O
I O
typically O
use O
the O
WARM O
setting O
. O
Overall O
, O
great O
finish O
and O
works O
very O
well O
. O
Despite O
me O
using O
the O
warm O
( O
not O
hot O
) O
setting O
, O
the O
thin O
film O
of O
plastic O
over O
the O
barrel O
and O
handle O
slowly O
started O
to O
peel O
off O
. O
Not O
a O
big O
deal O
, O
but O
definitely O
worth O
noting O
, O
in O
case O
that O
bothers O
you O
. O
It O
's O
does O
n't O
look O
so O
pretty O
now O
, O
and O
I O
've O
had O
it O
for O
about O
a O
year O
. O
Overall O
, O
great O
value O
for O
the O
money O
and O
excellent O
results O
, O
but O
the O
packaging O
I O
'd O
give O
a O
4/10 O
, O
they O
could O
have O
done O
better O
. O
