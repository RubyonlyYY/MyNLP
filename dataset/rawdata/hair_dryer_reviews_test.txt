My Revlon hair dryer started sparking and died in January, a few days after the one-year warranty expired (yay! not.) so I needed to find a quick replacement. I've been pleasantly surprised with this dryer so far! I have very thick hair that usually takes forever to dry, even with a dryer, but this one is nice and light and doesn't make my arm feel like it's going to snap off after holding it for a few minutes. Probably the smartest part of the design is the honeycomb pattern over the back--it's pretty much impossible for my hair to get through it and get stuck in the blades. That makes drying much easier, since I can move the dryer through my hair without worrying about sudden-onset baldness and pain.It's not too loud, and it's definitely quieter than my old dryer. My only minor complaint is that the nozzle (is that what it's called? the duckbill-looking thing that concentrates air) will occasionally fly off in the middle of drying. I'm not sure if that's force from the air, or from moving the dryer around, but it's not quite as secure as it could be. Other than that, I'm completely satisfied with this dryer--and the fun color is a plus, too!
It is beautiful, I ordered a white one, I really like this color!  The size is good and it has really nice design. I got it on time. I love it so much. It is easy to take!
I have long thick hair and it usually takes a long time to blow dry. Not with this dryer! It is the best one I ever had. I could not believe the price was so good. Love It!
Great buy for great price.
It works well. Makes my hair curly and dries it quickly. It makes me a little nervous bc I have long hair and I am scared that it will get sucked into the backside of the dryer.
Strong and powerful, however, it's a little too powerful for me. I was looking for a light dryer and this one works, it's not super light but it's also not too heavy and I didnt want to go through the hassle of returning.
Pretty good, not any better than other hair dryers in that price range.
Love this product. Nifty compact is a plus. Can be taken anywhere. Use to steam or dry hair.
Bought this to replace a Sunbeam 1500 and was VERY happy to find that the wall mount was compatible!Comparing the 2, the Sunbeam had 3 speeds, of which I only used the upper 2, and the Oster has 2 speeds, the 'upper 2'.
Really love the cold setting.
I have curly hair, this diffuser is perfect for getting curls to look defined without the frizz.
Wonderful product! I love it!
horrible
Works great and pretty color!
Great hair dryer.
Seem like package could have been shipped out sooner. But it arrived when promised. Great product & brand new. Used the dryer for 2 yrs up until my lil client touched it & it dropped. Had to duck tape it together for awhile until the new one arrived but it still worked wonders. LOVE, LOVE THIS DRYER!
Great size, and noise level.
As described,  works great.
This Xtava Rimini 1800 W hair dryer totally blew me away! It is a powerful 1800 watt hair dryer comes with a customized diffuser and concentration nozzle for precise styling and maximized condensed air flow which makes it superb for achieving the absolute perfect desired look.I am a licensed cosmetologist and I can tell you from experience that this hair dryer is professional quality and is exactly what I would use in my home salon. It is adjustable with three heat levels and two power levels to achieve complete control of your styling and lock in your perfect look with the cool shot button. Styling hair is an art and a Stylist is only as good as her tools. This dryer is a top of the line styling tool which means it saves me time and energy while I am styling and I get the desired look almost instantly.Say goodbye to frizz with this iconic hair dryer because it's designed to emit powerful negative ions to seal and smooth the hair's outer layer while it increases my hair's own natural shine while providing me with healthy and hydrated hair. The Xtava Rimini 1800W Hair Dryer has totally exceeded my expectations.Disclaimer: I received the Allure Hair Dryer during a promotion in exchange I would tell you what I thought about the Allure in this review. All statements made are solely my own and are based on my own personal experience while using this hair dryer. That being said, I would absolutely recommend this hair dryer to persons of all ages, it works better than great!
Its a blow dryer! LOL. I docked a star because it has a weaker output than my old blow dryer.  I appreciate the cold setting.
Good product. Did not have problems so far and work as expected.
I initially bought this for a vacation. Within a few days it would only blow cool air. Contacted Amazon who had Helen of Troy email me. They replaced it no questions asked and I didn't even have to send the new defective one back! But let me tell you this I LOVE! I use it every time I shower, not just for travel. It's smaller, but not on power, dries fast and the intake hasn't collected any dust like other dryers do. Has a few different power settings. along with the cool setting and I would recommend this in a heartbeat.
I was skeptical about purchasing this after reading several of the reviews, however, this blow dryer is AMAZING!  I have VERY thick, course, wavy, shoulder length hair.  With traditional Conair blow-dryers from Walmart, I would spend 10 minutes blow drying my hair and it would be left really dry and frizzy.  I thought that was how all blow dryers would affect my hair.  Wrong.  With this dryer, it now takes me 3-4 minutes to dry my hair and leaves it with a moisturized sheen.  I almost cried the first time I used it.  Yes, if you hold the handle too low you can accidentally press the buttons, however, to modify that I simply hold it higher up and have no problems.  When this one dies, I'm most definitely buying another.....especially at such a great discounted price!
Wonderful.
Haven't received it yet but looks good on the positive reviews
works great,  I love it... the buttons are a bet hard at times , mostly bc my old hands dont work as well as, they used to... but I would recommend and buy again.  great price, and quality.... does a great job
I love,
LOVE this hair dryer. It has great power and dries my hair rather quickly. Would highly recommend!
mine was green
This gets a 5+ star in my book.  I've used for a few weeks now and it dries my hair faster, smoother, and the 2 directional heads are perfect for directing the heat exactly where you want it to go.  It is so much better than my Conair that I had.  This is high end quality.
Bought for my wife. She says she loves it. No ten paragraph review needed here.
This is a piece of junk.  Set it up on the high watt setting, but found that it would not operate after my wife dried her hair. Setting it on the lower watt setting solved the problem for a few months.  Now the same thing often happens and it makes lots of noise.  I think it will stop entirely very soon.  Tried cleaning the lint out several times.  The lint screen is buried under plastic strips making it difficult to clean.
excellent good
Great little travel dryer. Works almost as good as a full size one.
Great little dryer and very reasonably priced! I bought this for my elderly mother.  Her hand held dryer had ceased working so this little dryer was the ticket! It is lightweight, small & easy to store, easy to use and it blows warm and cool air to dry my mother's hair! The most important part....she likes it, so what's not to love!
This is the second one we have mine is still going strong after two and a half years...and my daughters bombed out after 2 months and we have to get it replaced
You can tell right away this is a heavy duty hair dryer. I wanted something that had some power to it and couldn't find it at my local Target.  This is a great product. I have been practicing blow outs and its prefect for this.  So as much as this is more pricey than a normal blow dryer it is worth it.
It dries hair quickly and it's not to loud.
First tried this at a Hyatt Hotel. Loved it and now I own my own. Great for travel or everyday use.
I love it but... it's a little heavy!
I had a really old hair dryer.  So this one to me is awesome!!  It's not too noisy and it dries my hair quickly.
Seems to work just fine. Good price, no problems so far.
Compact and conveniently portable.  Dryer is not very powerful, so the brush it pretty much useless for my hair.  Surprisingly this dryer is not even as powerful as my handheld blow dryer.  Bonnet works fine as long as you are satisfied with the low/moderate heat.
Love it!!
It has plenty of power and dries well, but I had to return mine as it was so loud that it left my ears ringing.
Perfect!
best hairdryer
I have had better, Not very hot.
I LOVE this hair dryer!  I went on vacation and there was one in my room.  I loved it so much I came home and searched for it til I found it.  Amazon had the best price for this model.  When it came, I was not disappointed.  If you like your dryer to have a lot of force to it, this is the one.
It is a great space saver and it works very well.
Amazing.  Very short drying time with no frizz.
Best hair dryer ever
Worked well and as described.  Motor started to sound like a lawn mower, one week after it's one year warranty.Not happy.
really love it! my hair looked better than ever. dried about 3/4 times faster. drier is lighter and easier to work with when styling.dropped it accidentally and nothing was broken!drying seems enjoyable !have only used twice, but am glad that i bought it!
For the price paid, it is an  excellent buy.  I bought 3 so I would not worry about having a bad hair day without a hair dryer.  This hair dryer is simple and get the job done.  Either hot or cold.  Would be great if a third option available for hotter air.
Does its job.
Great dryer.Has cut her hair drying time by 40% with better results!
dryer itself works good, however i am already wrapping duct tape around the twist mechanism that allows the stand to go up and down....its cracked, first day of use, I should send it back but I need the dryer now
Works well, I wish this could be much smaller
Works very nice on both voltages
Doesn't get hot enough
Bought this for my wife and and she recently took it on a trip and loved it. Powerful enough, not too noisy, takes up little space. It does exactly what you want from a travel dryer.
it is good drying tool. I expected it to be a bit better from reading reviews.It does the job as drying hair and it is good quality and well made hair dryer.I recommend.
Loved this hairdryer until it stopped working today. It just quit. Reset button won't fix it. Very disappointed as I had a much cheaper hairdryer and it lasted years. This has only lasted 3 months!
Excellent choice!
LOVE IT!!!!! Highly recommend it!!
Although the package was damaged on arrival the contents were intact.  This was replacement for an identical Conair unit that my Bride has used continually for several years.  We expect the new Conair to be as serviceable as the previous one.
This hair dryer is wonderful!
Fantastic bonnet drier. Definitely worth paying a little extra to get a quality product. I primarily use this when I am doing a deep treatment on my hair.
Only used for few months and already quit working.
Love the small size.  Dries my hair very quickly and comes with a great travel bag.  It does such a good job that I forget that it is travel size.
I love this one! Great purchase. It drys my hair super fast!
I love this hair dryer!  The power it delivers is perfect and it seems to dry my hair in half the time of my old one. The speed and heat buttons are 'user friendly' and the heavy cord is nice and long. Altho it's not quite as light as I'd imagined and maybe even a little bigger than my old one, I wouldn't consider it to be heavy or bulky and it's still quiet and powerful.  Good value for the money.
Great dryer, I use it to deep conditioner my hair.  I love the portability of this product.  This is a lot better than the bulky hooded dryer.
love this dryer,, it is my second one, but wish it lasted longer- first one was less than 2 yrs
This was delivered well within the promised window even though we were in the middle of one of the worst weather weeks this winter so far.  When I used the dryer I was even more pleased because my hair felt sooooo soft and was so shiny. Even my hubby thought my hair felt softer.  You ladies are doing great work and I thank Amazon for carrying your line of products.
Excellent product and it is exactly as described by the seller!
I absolutely love this hair dryer. With long thick hair I'd gotten used to spending 15-20 minutes just drying my hair enough to allow me to style it. This dryer is not only lightweight and quieter than any dryer I've ever had but it also dries my hair in 5-6 min. That's from dripping just out of the shower wet to nearly bone dry in less than half the time. I don't even need to use the highest heat settings so my frizz is much more contained. With myself and two thick haired daughters using it a fast dryer is a must. So excited to finally have found something that actually is a good as it claims to be.
it doesnt damage the hair like the other dryers ive tried and its very lightweight
does the job right
I've been very happy with this so far.  It's very light, and I love that it has three heat (one being no heat) settings and two speed settings, which is more than most dryers have.  The airflow is pretty strong on the high setting.  The setting labels are already wearing off though, after only a few months of regular use.
I already had this hairdryer so it was just a replacement.Still love it
wow!!! incredibly fast shipping from Mix Wholesale. I ordered it on Thursday..it arrived on Saturday (and I live in Georgia). put it together in less than 20 minutes and powered it up! So easy to assemble!! Can't wait to use this on my 4b/c natural hair!! will update again after more use.Update: This dryer is fantastic!! Dried my freshly washed, dense, chin length 4b/c hair in about 40 minutes! on medium heat!! I did not need neck covers or ear protectors at all. I have a pic of the size rollers I used; they fit with AMPLE space under the hood. It's also very quiet--I had no trouble having a conversation on my phone; easily watched television. I haven't had to duct tape anything, it's pretty sturdy, a little wobbly, but not I'm not moving around a lot if I'm sitting under the dryer anyway..Basically, I love it and I'm SO GLAD i didn't waste my money on a Pibb or PEBCO brand. I don't own a salon, but it's great for home use and is a million times better than standing in front of my mirror trying to dry my hair with a handheld blowdryer.
Works great, mounts nice!
best blowdryer! Love it! Recommended by my hair stylist and its amazing!
Great used this for my aunts salon, cheap but works like its an expensive dyer
I have thin fine hair and it is gentle enough on my hair and gives me the volume I need.Thank you.
I love this hair dryer.  It is so easy to use.  And I really like that the cord is extra long to reach an outlet in another room.  Does a great job on my hair which has become dryer due to aging.  Great for all seniors!!
This is a very nice, professional looking hairdryer. Nice color and the design is very sleek and sharp looking. Looks like it's worth a lot more than what it really cost. It comes in a nice box, so it's very suitable for gifting.The description says it's ultra lightweight but, for me, it felt like it weighed just as much as any other hairdryer. I like that it has 2 speeds and 3 heat settings. I have very fine hair, so how much heat I use on my hair makes a big difference. The hottest setting does seem to get very hot, so be careful. Also with my fine hair, the higher settings had a tendency to tangle my fine hair, so I had to usually use the medium heat setting, which worked well. The hairdryer itself was not loud and dried my hair quickly. It has a long cord and comes with a concentrator nozzle which really help to reduce frizz. The concentrator nozzle is very easy to remove and put back on when needed. I also like that this hairdryer had a removable filter, it was easy to twist off for cleaning. Overall, it's powerful and does a nice job. I loved the look and it's easy to hold and use. Hoping it will last awhile. Would definitely recommend.Disclosure: I was not financially compensated for this post. The opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product. I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for my unbiased and honest opinion.
This product had great reviews, so I thought I'd give it a try. Turns out it's the BEST blowdryer! It's lightweight and dries in a very short amount of time.
I cannot express how much I love this hair dryer! It's small and sleek. It gives me the hair I want to have, that look that I was always jealous of others having. I no longer look like a big frizz ball! I didn't know that hair could look this good, and I'm thankful for the opportunity to test this product complimentary and give my experiences and feedback. I love all the features of this hair dryer. The cooling feature is by far the best feature along with the nozzles. I use to let my hair air dry and it took so long to dry being my hair is so long. This hair dryer took about 10-15 minutes. I didn't get tangled hair that hurt brushing out like I did with other hair dryers. This is the best dryer!
I can see why other reviewers found the parts to be flimsy and plastic.  It could very easily break and be unrepairable.  But the heat is steady and well distributed.  The cooler setting does not burn my scalp and the hotter setting is great for a quick blast to get drying started on my long hair.  I will say to be very careful with the plastic parts and it should be fine.
good job
exelente
good hair dryer works well
My old (Revlon) hair dryer went kaput, and I went to a local store and bought another Revlon to replace it.  Yikes!  While it did dry my very straight, fine hair quickly, the air flow was so strong that when I put my hair in velcro curlers, the Revlon hair dryer blew the curlers out of my hair!  So I went looking on my beloved Amazon to find a better hair dryer with lots of positive reviews, and ended up ordering this for about the same price I paid for the Revlon one.  This one is great--so much more substantial and quality feeling and noticeably quieter and less shrill sounding than the Revlon.My single complaint is that the toggle switches on the handle that control the air flow and heat settings are a little too easy to accidentally change when drying your hair.  But I still like this hair dryer a lot.
good product all well
Great hair dryer , have been using them for years.  Nice wall hung means out of the way not laying on the counter or having to unplug and put away each time it is used.  My last one lasted about 5 years.  Bought two more .
Wind is strong and does not feel too hot. Get hairs dry quickly. Love this product.
Love this.  I dropped my previous one, different brand, and had to replace it.  The cord-keeper part is the main feature for me.  The hair dryer itself works fine, a little louder than most but is also more lightweight than most.  Love it!
it an excelent  product
It drys my hair, does what it's supposed to, pretty much says it all. If it's alive a few years from now I'll be impressed
it's not very powerfull but it woks properly
I bought it for my maine coon cat. He likes this dryer.
Great!!!
good
I love how lightweight, fast and VERY quiet this hairdryer is. The reason I dropped it to four stars is because it has a tendency to tangle my fine (not thin) hair, but the pros definitely outweigh the one con. Fine-haired women just need to be careful about pointing the dryer down the hair shaft to keep the tangles at bay.
No better than less expensive hair dryers I have owned.  Died after about 6 months.
This is the best hair dryer.  It is my second one.  I had the first one for years and when it finally broke, I tried a few other blow dryers but returned them all and went right back to the Conair 1875.  The cord keeper is a great feature for me, since I keep the dyer in a drawer.  It stays in there compactly.
Use it every time I wash my hair. Pretty good. It's been a while, works without problem.
It's good, just what I wanted.
This was installed in a RV on the wall of the bathroom area. The unit is plugged into a 110 volt GFCI outlet and the night light and unit power can be turned on/off by pressing the GFCI button. The night light is good - not too bright but ample. The unit appears to offer good air flow and not being too noisy. I am happy with the performance, looks and operation so far.
My daughter loves the color pink so I had to get it. Simple speeds as a standard hair dryer.
Great for my Natural hair. Has proven to be sturdy & saves me a lot of time in the washing process.
Love it. Does a good. Hot enough. Diffuser is a bonus.
Just started using😁😀
Works very well. A little hard to mount on the wall . Careful measuments are needed
Good quality. Very pretty. Powerful. Only complaint is its kinda heavy so after a while it kinda hurts my hand. But I guess it's not really a problem since it dries my hair pretty quick.
i love it
Amazing product works great for naturally curly hair!
It really does what it says -- it effectively smoothes hair and significantly helps reduce frizz.
I love this blow drier. Cut my blow dry time in half. I bought the leopard/cheetah print one. The price on this item has changed significantly, unfortunately. When I purchased, this dryer was significantly less expensive than other colors of the same model. Before ordering and receiving I was concerned it was a knock off because it was cheaper than the other two color options. I do think it is real. It works well. Feels well made. I looked at all of the instructions closely on the box for spelling/grammar mistakes which are common with fakes and found none. I've had about 2 months now and it works well. I also had one of my good friends look at it closely. She is a cosmetologist and currently works at a salon that sells this brand. She said it looked authentic to her.
I have used other hair dryers from Xtava, and this one is by far my favorite. The other one was great for quickly drying my hair, but it left my ends feeling really dried out. This one takes a little longer to dry my hair, but it leaves my hair feeling so soft and not damaged at all.This dryer is very easy and pretty straight forward to use. There are three heat settings on the heat switch, three speed settings on the speed switch, and a cool shot air button. On the heat switch you will find low, medium, and high temperatures. On the speed switch you will find off, gentle, and strong. The cool shot button is used to set your style. I like to use this dryer on him heat and strong speed. I use a round brush to style my hair, then the cool shot to set.The dryer comes with two attachments, a concentrated and a diffuser. The diffuser is great for those with curly hair who want to reduce frizz. The connector is great for people who have straight hair. It really helps me style my hair straighter, without needing a straightener.I really like how hight weight this dryer is. I have been having some weird back/shoulder problems over the last couple years, so the lightweight hair dryer is something that I can really appreciate. I have small hands and I think that this is very easy to hold.The hair dryer is quite and while it might not have the power you are used to, it works great. I like that my hair appears to be far less damaged with this dryer than any other i have used, and it only takes a couple more minutes to dry. That is a tradeoff I am more than willing to make. This is the dryer I will continue to use on a day to day basis. Like others, I did receive this to review, what I have written is honest. I would not mislead consumers as I would not want to be mislead. This is a product that I stand by.
This hair dryer is top quality and I love it. Dries my hair quickly, is light weight and works great. Has many adjustments for speed and heat plus cold blast. Best dryer I have ever owned so far.
I really like the dryer and the price isn't to bad either. The only compliant I have are the switches are right where you hand/fingers go and I keep flipping them when I don't want too.
Love it, has 3 settings and cool, warm and hot for drying hair. Works very nice. And low, med and high also.
This is a fabulous hair dryer.  It comes in a nice box and a nice color blue.  It is so light weight which makes it easy to dry my long hair.  Normally it takes a while to dry my hair but with this hair dryer it probably cut the time in half.  It has a nice diffuser along with 3 heat settings.  I like to start out on high, then a curling brush and low heat and finally cool to set my hair.  I love the cool shot to set it too.  My hair has less frizzies and looks a lot healthier since using this hair dryer.  I am so glad I got to try it complimentary  for a honest and unbiased opinion.
Excellent power with easy to use temperature change contol.
LOVE IT!
love it!
Arrived soooo fast made me very happy!!!!!! and the dryer it self is fantastic.
This is a nice hair dryer I really like the color to it. It looks fabulous. The hair dryer it self is light weight. I like to use it without the attachment because usually it works faster than with it but that is just because I have long hair that has tangling issues. The hair dryer gets hot enough to dry your hair fast and it will look great. It has a nice long cord to it that doesn't get tangled up either. I received this as a gift to share my experiences while using this product.
Love it. Recieved it quickly. Dries really fast. Only down side is that it vibrates leaving my hand tingly. But its awesome.
Quiet yet efficient.
Just received my new blow dryer in the mail.  When I opened it, it was damaged, very disappointed.
I've only been using this dryer for a week but like it. It is powerful and does a nice job. I'm not sure how long it is going to last however. But for the price, I'm pleased.
The only con is the weight. It's pretty heavy but it works perfectly.
works as expected.  Love the zebra print zipper pouch it comes with.  Arrived quickly and price was very competetive.  Keeping it in my suitcase for travelling as it is small.  Small but quite powerful.
Decent heat temperature and air flows.  A good hair dryer for the price.  Lighter weight than the last silver model I had.  That one lasted for nearly 10 years with every other daily use.
I have owned one of these dryers in the past, and found it like many others.. in a hotel bathroom. Great dryer. Very affordable. I accidentally broke mine dropping it down an entire flight of stairs. Just replaced even cheaper than I purchased it for 5 years ago.
BEST HAIR DRYER, VERY HAPPY
Excellent! I am so glad I bought this. Great quality and dried my whole head of hair in minutes which is wonderful after I allow myself a few more minutes of sleep in the morning. A really good and worthwhile purchase! Just want to say I am still thrilled with this purchase of about 6 months ago! It dries my hair incredibly fast but also gives it body that lasts for a couple of days. I could not be happier with this product. I've been around for a while and no other hair dry has ever come close. Jump out of the shower, blow dry my hair for a very short time, and I'm on my way! Love it!!!
Great hair dryer, nicely balanced, good air flow, and not too loud. This is one appliance I hate having to replace, as you get so accustomed to one, but this one is if anything an improvement over my old favorite. Dual heat & speed controls are a must for me. Nice inclusion of the extra drying attachments.
DO NOT BUY THIS!!! Im a professional salon owner and i bought this. Something inside broke off and every time it is turnes on it makes this excruciating click clank cling sound that hurts your ears while under the dryer plus the loud sound of the dryer. I have to use it on the lowest settings which takes hours upon hours just to dry.  I used this dryer 3 times before the problem started.
Exactly as described
I never ever write reviews for products, but with this I had to!! It's that amazing. My hair is very thick, and blowdrying my hair with this dryer is faster and easier than I ever could have imagined. You know that amazing feeling you get when you've just gone to a salon? That's what your hair is like every time you use this dryer. 100% worth the money.
good heat
Good dryer, lightweight & works well. 2 speeds.
Very good blow dryer! I usually buy very cheap ones but splurged a little this time. Love it! It is a little heavier than I'm used to.
Excellent in every way , I really like this.My favorite by far
good product
I couldn't find good for my hair any. Only this one I use about 2-3 years already, and still have it as a gift for my mom.Highly recommended item!
very nice!
Exactly like photo. Delivered fast. Great price.
I am very happy with this product. It dries fast! It seems like a very sturdy product, not like some of the low end products out there. This is salon quality!!
My previous Vagabond, which I loved and traveled with for many years, finally kicked the bucket and I replaced it today with the current model. I was a little bummed that purple was no longer a color option (strange, since it is in the other Conair models), but was extremely upset to discover that the power cord is now a full six inches shorter! I couldn't believe it and got the old one out of the trash to compare side by side. Shorter. By a lot. This makes a huge impact on how far from the outlet I can stand while drying my hair and is incredibly annoying. Would have happily paid more for the longer cord. Very disappointed.
I have had this hair dryer for a week and I love it! I can dry my hair in under 10mins. The attachment allows you to put the dryer on your hair which speeds up the drying time. I have thin but long hair and I'm amazed at how quickly it dries my hair.
It's a good hair dryer the attachment just won't stay on 
good power
just like another reviewer wrote - the bonnet's elastic is so tight that it hurt my head and I didn't have very large rollers on. I took her advice and took out the elastic and put in a long shoe lace which was a very time consuming and frustrating job but it worked. Plus I don't know how anyone could sit there with the setting on high. The medium setting is almost too hot. If I hadn't read the her review about replacing the elastic, I would of sent it back.
Works great arrived on time.
The disk somehow smells like plastic
Just like my old one.  I love it.
I love this! Great!
Great product
Love this hair dryer. So glad i got it. Also, i live what the company stands for.
Best blow dryer ever...you can feel the quality as soon as you pick it up...performance=none better...worth every penny.
I love this hair dryer!  It is quieter than my older Conair.  It has nice speed/temperature settings that blow dry quickly without as much damage. I can dry my below shoulder length hair with the medium heat/air setting in less than 10 minutes. My hair is soft and easy to style, plus attachments stay on tight. I will buy Remington from now on.
This hairdryer is perfect for thick hair. The handle feels comfortable while in use and the nozzle has vent holes, so you can get real close to your scalp and the air deflects through the holes. Great design.
I just replaced my old Conair hair dryer. I like the 1875 models, as they are usually more powerful and work more quickly. I do not recommend this model, however. Although it is an 1875 power, it works like one of the smaller, less powerful models. And this one is terribly, terribly loud. I'm actually concerned that I might suffer hearing loss if I were to use this on a daily basis. I'll be returning this one.
Dries my hair fast and isn't very loud. Absolutely love it! Thank you so much!
Good!
Perfect replaced old one I was very pleased with.
Hair dryer works great
When I first turned this product on my hair was wet. When I turned this device off my hair was dry.I purchased this because I was looking for the cheapest product available. It worked perfectly and does appear to be a quality product. I have been very happy so far.
This dryer is ok I was hoping for something a little more powerful than what I already had. It gets the job done but no quicker than my other blow dryer...in fact I feel like it takes my hair a bit longer to try.  And it is HEAVY. After reading the great reviews, I guess I was hoping for something more than it actually was--which is a regular ok hair dryer.
It's missing a screw to put this together :-( Besides that.....I received it on time; it's the right size, and the price was excellent.......
Quiet and quick. My old hairdryer was a screamer and I got this one because I was developing tinnitus and everything I read suggested controlling decibels was important.  The buttons are right where you grip the handle, so it takes a little getting used to placing fingers so you're not changing your settings.  My hair is smoother.
I was very satisfy with my order and it was delievery on time as promise. Excellent Excelllent 10 Stars
Good seller. I received the product on time and without problems. I recommend for all.
Perfect for my needs!
Works good.  Doesn't seem to have the output force on low speed that my previous hairdryer had (wattage is the same).  Seems to get the warmest heat it needs to be on high.  I prefer a low speed with high heat.
I love the hair dryer by conair. My last one was a conair. It lasted many years.
dvice work with 110 ac and my home 220  also not writ in amazon abut ac tks
I spent a very long time waiting for the right deal on an ionic hair dryer and this was the first time in at least 6 months that I saw what I was looking for with an appealing price tag. I took the plunge and bought it and have been VERY happy with the results. My hair turns out very smooth and is even shiny after I use it. The clip on accessory is amazing for focusing the air stream and definitely helps with minimizing frizz. It is also very pretty. :)
Everything is working well. No problems after a month. Happy with everything.
Awesome product.. I would recommend it to anyone
met my expectations.
Works as well as the expensive ones. Super price.
Good while it lasted.  I used it (at best) 5 times before it just stopped working.
Love this hair dryer.  Had an older one for years, it finally died so I replaced it with this newer version.
This is a great hair dryer and is a lot lighter than the clunky old one I used to have. It looks great and helps my morning routine go a lot faster. I am able to dry my hair quickly and I love the attachment that it comes with to be able to focus all the hot air on one section of hair at a time as I am brushing it out. When I use the attachment it makes my hair look a lot better as well than without using it. This is a powerful hair dryer it isn't the most powerful hair dryer I have ever seen but definitely a very good one. It is very powerful and dries my hair quickly which is awesome since I have really long hair. It is a nice sleek hair dryer so it fits nicely into my hair dryer holder and looks really nice as well. I received this as a gift to share my experiences while using this product.
I would definitely buy this again. I had an older model for years that we traveled with and it finally wore out.
Great little hairdryer - especially for travel.
The best hair dryer ever!
Works great and light to handle
This dryer dries my hair quickly, leaving it smooth and shiny.  And my hair requires less touching up on the second day.
This is a very sleek and stylish hair dryer. It looks very nice! It’s powerful at 2200 watts. This hair dryer comes with a concentrator nozzle but no diffuser. However, a previous diffuser that I owned fit on this just fine. It has a nice long cord too. The only thing is the cord is really thick so it easily knocks stuff down if anything gets in its way. I was very excited to get an opportunity to receive this for testing and inspection purposes. It works very well and dries my hair quickly. I like the more powerful hair blowers because they dry hair much faster than lower wattage dryers do. This one comes in black and looks very stylish. The concentrator works well too but you do need to push hard to get it on the hair dryer. It has three temperatures, hot, warm, and cold (or room temperature but it always feels cold to me.) It also has two speeds, low and high. In addition, it comes with a cool shot button, which gives you a blast of cold air when you push the button. The button is easy to push but it's also black so it blends into the hair dryer. I would have liked it if the cool shot button was a different color. Other than that though, I really like this hair dryer. It's powerful and efficient at drying my hair. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.
I have been impressed with each Xtava product I have tried and this hair dryer is no different. This dryer is powerful enough to dry my hair completely in a short amount of time. I like the attachments, especially the diffuser. I'm also quite fond of the bright blue color. Product provided to facilitate this review, but all opinions are honest and my own.
Not good at all
The first thing I noticed about the hair dryer was the sturdy sleek cord which felt well made and strong. The cord is long enough to plug into the wall and be able to use it 6ft away from the outlet. The hair dryer comes with the concentrator nozzle which I would have died without but it doesn’t bring the diffuser nozzle which I found kind of odd since most companies include both nozzles. Anyway, so I plugged in the hair dryer and started to blow dry my hair using the same brush I always use. I tested out the different heat settings and was impressed with how quickly the temperatures change. If you switch from hot to cold it happens instantly meanwhile I’ve owned hair dryers that take at least 20-30 seconds just to make the temperature change. The two different speed settings are your standard low and high, yet, at the high speed the noise the drier makes is not loud at all. The dryer isn’t completely soundless but it isn’t obnoxiously loud compared to others I’ve owned. I found that when I used this hair dryer my styling time was 20-30 minutes quicker than usual. In addition, my hair felt really smooth afterwards and the end result wasn’t as frizzy as I expected considering I have curly hair and I'm not a professional at blow drying.  UPDATE: After using the hairdryer for a few months, I noticed that whenever I would use this dryer my scalp would become very oily right after blow drying. Whenever I use my old Revlon hair dryer my scalp remains dry and I have never had this issue before. I haven't changed any other hair care or hair tool besides this dryer so this must be the culprit.  I did receive this complimentary for review purposes but this does not influence my opinion.
Great hair dryer.  Fast and hot.  Good quality product.
how did this product get so many 5 star reviews?The product is good and the idea of a wall mounted dryer is excellent. The product fails in my view because the three tiny 'Mollies' supplied to hold it to the wall are pathetically under engineered. The dryer will just pull off the wall after a couple of times.A better way to mount is to drill a second hole in the mounting plate and to screw it to a wall stud with long screws.Another good product hijacked by under engineered Chinese Manufacture!
Nice dryer! Just as expected.
Okay, I have fine hair so my hair doesn't take that long to dry.....I can have my hair dry/styled in about 3 minutes with this powerful blow dryer and that is on the medium heat.  Great dryer with a nice leopard pattern.
Great Hairdryer
el producto es muy buenothe product is very good
The hood collapses. The hood does not stay mounted
Great dryer. Really like how there is a constant cool setting that doesn't have to be pressed the whole time. The different heat setting are nice as well. And the cord keeper, oh my gosh---totally radical.  No more wrapping the cord around the dryer for me (I hope)
I absolutely love this hair dryer. I not only use it on my hair but I use it with my crafting! This dryer is AMAZING. Multiple heat options as well as blowing speed. Plus another button for cold air. Great dryer! Very powerful.
Works really well! Only thing is control switches are where your fingers go so fingers push switches and changes settings while blow drying.
Very good article! i have 4C natural hair and I use the large comb to make the blow dry, wonderful! i'm in loveI leave in france and the article was well packed
My hair is thick and long.  It dries frizzy without blowing it dry.  I do not get  the chance to go to the salon much.  The attachments on this dryer make me feel like I am doing something for myself without devoting more time.  I love the color blue and black.  I loved the opportunity to use this dryer.  In exchange for I am also providing my honest and unbiased opinion.  The drying time on my hair was cut down by a few minutes.  I have a three year old daughter that will not be still for anything. I used it on hers for just a minute on low cool.  It was perfect.  Not too strong but enough to help knock out the wetness.  I prefer the high warm on mine.  I do not need to further damage my hair.  Which means cutting out the drying time is preserving my hair some.  Without the attachments this hair  dryer should travel easily.  The cord is not too heavy and should roll up easily.
Excellent product! Powerful and light weight..I love it!!!
I have thick, long hair and this was recommended by my hair stylist. It is very powerful and dries my hair more quickly than anything I have bought before.  I would highly recommend this.
Love it!
Bought for my son and he loves it and uses it every day.  Not too loud which is great.
I have thick long hair that takes what it seems like hours to dry. So I had to see if this hair dryer  was as great as it says. And it is! My hair drying time got cut more than half of what it usually is. And my hair doesn't feel frizzy like it does most of the time. I never tried a iconic hair dryer before but I heard good things about it. So I am excited to have this one. And it's big but it is also light weighed, which makes it perfect. It comes with two attachments and I tell you when I tried both of them out, it felt good on my scalp. It was like a light massage. I am proudly leaving my honest opinion about this product that I have received.
Works better than expected
I got this for the wife. But have to say it's not noticeably lighter than the previous unit we had but it is very sharp looking. The controls are all conveniently placed with a plenty of speed and heat settings. The cord is of very good quality and pretty lengthy. I feel for the price it's a very good buy and would really recommend it.
I received this hair dryer as a sample for review and evaluation and I have found it to be working well. It comes in a nice box that is very suitable for gifting.  The pros on this dryer for me are that it is lightweight, has a long cord, is sleek and not bulky, and comes with a concentration too. The con for me (someone that has long, thin, fine hair) is that it tends to be hot even on the lower settings. Sometimes this is a pro but overall for my hair type it is a bit too hot for the total drying process so my hair tends to be more tangled at the end. All things considered I still think it's a great dryer and I realize not everyone has my hair type.
I absolutely love this hair dryer. My old hair dryer would take me 20 mins to dry my hair and now I can dry my hair in 5 mins.
I love this blow dryer.  It dries my hair, which is very thick in very little time.  High quality, especially compared to the blow dryers you can buy in the local market.
After 12 years, my old (exactly the same) dryer died - it didn't owe me a thing.  I was pleased to find the same design still available.  We have a small bathroom so I don't have the space to leave a dryer on a counter, and I'm certainly not going to take one out each morning and put it away after use.  This is so darn convenient!
Love it but it's so small. Can't wear rollers with it unless your willing to put in the time to stretch out the cap and pull your hair.
great dryer-----love the diffuser that comes with it.  Not too expensive and it's lightweight and compact.  very highly recommend
When I first received this product i was a little sketchy, as hair dryers normally make my hair super frizzy.This hair dryer is amazing. The diffuser works just as it should. My normally frizzy hair was smooth and flyaway free, which is attributed to the ionic technology.This dryer has 2 speeds and 3 heat settings, as well as a cool button, which is always good after a long time of use on your scalp.Its very lightweight and easy to use. Even a beginner, like myself, can get use out of this product.It has a nice cool blue tone on the front, which is good for me.All in all i'd say this product is the best hair dryer i have used to date. Would highly recommend to anyone.
This Conair works so much better than most blow dryers.  It is a great color and had a great output.  I was so very impressed with how much quality you get for the price.  The reason I am giving it 4 stars is because it is a little heavier, not cheap plastic at all.
Super powerful, blows a lot of air.  I had a much more expensive hairdryer that was almost double the price for the past 6 years before this one and this one is even more powerful than my old one.  I need a strong hairdryer b/c I have very thick hair.  Just to give you an idea, wall mounted hair dryers at hotels are totally useless to me.  If I plan to dry my hair while traveling, I have to bring one.  This one comes with a bunch of different attachments.  And I like the animal print (although my husband does not but that print was much cheaper for some reason than the solid color ones)
Whoa...amazing what a difference this hair dryer makes ! Ive owned many, none that compare to this ! No more uncontrollable or fly away hair !  Its like magic ! The best ive owned !!!
Does it job but too noisy
Nothing fancy. Works well for the price. Good value for money.
good
Nice price nice product no complaints
Works great.  I have thick hair and it dries really quickly with this hair dryer.
It doesn't feel cheap and I like how the top is long enough that my hair (I have mid-length hair) doesn't get sucked into the back of it where the fan is. Buttons are easy to work with, better than those you have slide up and down.
This is the best hair dryer I've ever owned!! It has so many settings you could never burn your hair unless you don't know what you're doing, which seems impossible!! I can dry my hair in half the time it's so strong!! That's the biggest deal for me!! Plus, it has 3 settings for how strong to blow dry, 3 settings for how hot and cool, plus the cool button!! Definitely spend the money on this, it's worth it!!
I love my dryer!
love it wish it had a comb for naturals but it's worth it . great blow out Everytime
Delivery was on time! I They are so easy and light to handle. Just what I was looking for.Thanks so much!!
Pretty average. Just what I needed, though. About what I expected, for the money.
love it! heavy and durable hair dryer
Super hot and really nice to use.  Serves its purpose, what more could I ask!?
Quit heating after 60 days,
I have thick and course hair and it takes like an hour or so to dry my hair and with this dryer it takes 10-15 minutes. So glad I purchased this.
I absolutely loved this dryer! It dried my thick, heavy hair so fast! Also, the cord was fantastically long! Would be 5 stars, but I bought it last April, and sadly it has already died on me. There seems to be a short in the cord. If I wiggle the cord around at the base of the dryer, I can still get it to work a little. Tempted to buy another, since the price is so reasonable.
Recomendado,
I love this dryer because it is so gentle with only two settings. The band on the bonnet is tight at first, but after weekly or biweekly use it gets a bit more comfortable. I cover my ears with Wrapp-it bands when drying. The carrying case is convenient and everything fits perfectly inside even after several uses.
Kind of weak, not quite powerful or hot enough for my liking.
Im tired of this review being deleted.I rated it 5 stars so hopely it wont be deleted again. This hair dryer is heavy.
This was a replacement for the same unit we'd had for years.  Just a simple snap-in installation.  Great product at a great price.
Love this hairdryer! I've had maybe 5 or 6 of them. Mostly they only die when I drop them on the floor. I love the fact that the new one fits the wall mount from the last one and I didn't have to make new holes in my wallpaper! It's a great little hairdryer and not expensive.
Purchased because I needed a hair dryer, but didn't want to spend a lot of money. I like it. If you want something that gets the job done and doesn't cost a fortune, it's a great option for you. I've used it several times now and I've had no issues.
Convenient and classy wall mount hair dryer. No fumbling under the sink or closet. Available when I want it!
Good, basic dryer. Liking it a lot.
great hair dryer
I usually dread having to blow dry my hair as it is very long and pretty thick, so it would often take an hour or more to get it ALMOST all the way dry. Because of the time it takes to blow dry, and the fact I am semi lazy, I have had the same motel type dryer for about 15 years (YIKES) and been hesitant to buy a new one figuring they would ALL take forever to dry the mop on my head. When I was offered the Xtava, Allure 2200W hair dryer to review for an unbiased opinion I was pretty excited!This hairdryer is a decent size, yet very lightweight. It has 2 heat settings as well as the option for a cool blast here and there. There is also a detachable piece to put on it for when you want to dry your hair section by section to straighten it.After trying this the first time, I now want to use it every time I wash my hair! It is super easy to handle, which is awesome if you're all over the place flipping your hair around like I do. One of my favorite parts was that the back vent didn't try to eat my hair! My old one would suck it in if you got it within an inch of that vent, I am tendered headed, IT HURT!  ALL of my hair was dry, no slightly damp spots at all within 20 minutes. I highly recommend this particular hair dryer for those with long thick like hair. Yes ladies and Gents, it IS possible to have lots of hair and not hog up the bathroom for hours on end!
This dryer is amazing I have 3c/4a hair and it dried and straightened my hair in mins wow! Love it!
I have been using this brand and dryer for 10 years now.  They last a long time and makes my job as a stylist satisfying.  Its gets the job done great for keratin treatments too
High heat is very high.  Like the dryer.  This is the second one I have bought.
Works great, wife happy
Works as expected
SOMEWHAT better than others its size; though still blows very hot, (almost to Hot on the Low setting); but is useful for Travel
I couldn't live without it!
Excellent seller, good product, was exactly what I ordered, arrived on schedule with no problems and works perfectly, thanks
Daughter is very satisfied. Dryer does everything she expected. And a great price.
best blowdryer I've owned, I've had it for 3 years and still works as good as new.
Works very well so far.  Seems sturdier than other brands.  Dries hair quickly.  Noise is per a normal hair dryer.  Heat and air velocity both normal.I went through 3 or 4 of a competing model that would last only 1-2 years and then burn out.  I had just been replacing them because the new dryer would fit into the old wall mount, but decided not to keep shelling out money for an inferior product that did not last.Bought a different competing model but it started making a high pitched sound after 2 days, and did not get hot enough to efficiently dry hair so it was returned.Finally bought this one.  It is not as aesthetically pleasing as competing models, but not quite as ugly as the photo makes it seem.  The dryer is white and gray (wish it were all white), but the gray is a normal gray, not the greenish color that it looks like in the listing.  The wall mount does not install flush to the wall, as others have mentioned, but it is close enough.  I quickly got used to turning it on and off at the wall mount - it not the annoyance I anticipated.  In addition, if you put it in the wall mount while it is on, it automatically turns off, which is kind of convenient.  The best part of this dryer is that you can open the back and clean the fan blades.  I suspect build up of lint on the blades is what eventually caused the other dryers to burn out, and with the other dryers it is not possible to access the blades (at least not easily).  Thus, I expect this dryer to last longer.  There is also a hidden setting where you can turn the power up, and I did that when it first arrived.
It dries my hair very fast but is a little on the heavy side.
I absolutely love this dryer! I was a bit apprehensive at first because of the price tag but it's well worth the money. I have curly, color treated hair and I definitely noticed the difference using this hair dryer verses my old one. My hair feels healthy, smoother...as if I just came back from the salon! Great product!
Best hairdryer on the market. Not too loud and dries hair fast. I should have bought 2
Cut my drying time in half!! Love it :)
I love this hairdryer, so lightweight and my hair is great.  It really does make a difference to have a great hairdryer.
Better than expected.
I don't know... Grat price but too weak.
What can you say about a hairdryer? It dries my hair nicely lol. It doesn't get as hot as I expected, like my last one did. But it's a nice hairdryer for the price!
all excellent, recommended 100%
Perfect. Just what I wanted. Fast delivery!
Great dryer, it's fast and it was a great buy.
Used this at a hotel and had to have it!  Best hair dryer I ever used.
Not as loud as other hair dryers, and has plenty of power. I don't feel that it gets as hot as some of my other hair dryers, but that's probably not a bad thing because i don't over dry my hair.
A great lightweight product, easily stored on a shelf.  I bought it to heat process my hair color, and it does the trick.
very good product. Love it. 5 stars
Great product!
Works great.  No complaints.  Fyi: I'm 28 & never owned a hair dryer before so I dont have anything to compare it to.  BTW If you think it this product sucks, it doesn't; it blows.
A little bit too big for travelling
Straight out of the box this is the best blow dryer I have ever used.  It is really light weight and easy to handle.  There are 3 settings and 2 temps with a cool blast for setting your hair.  I  have long thick frizzy hair that some days I would love to cut all off.  My other hair dryer, never got rid of any of the frizziness.  Big plus also is the diffuser  attachment that is included.  What a difference, with the 1800 watts my hair is dry in 1/2 the time and is smoother than I could have every imagined.  This is definitely a salon grade product at a great price.  I did receive at a special deal and love the fact that I was able to test such a wonderful product.
nice hair dryer
This is my second Xtava hair dryer.  I have to say this one makes even that one look wimpy.  I cannot believe how fast it dried my hair.  Right out of the shower and it was only about 4 minutes for my thick hair to be completely dry and cooled.  This hair dryer is a little hefty compared to others but I think it is easier to handle than my other Xtava.  Also even though the hottest setting is quite hot the hair dryer itself only heats up at the end.  You can hold the barrel if you need to maneuver it.The power was unexpected.  My hair did tangle slightly but it was no big deal considering how much more volume I gained.  Even after brushing my hair it isn't flat.  My hair is smoother than usual as if I had flat ironed it.  The hot is hot and the cold is cold as if you had air conditioning for your head.  So, you don't have to spend extra time cooling after drying.  It was a matter of seconds after drying to having perfect cool hair.  The extra power of this dryer may have a learning curve.  I actually had to figure out where I had wet hair because I'm used to having still damp hair.  Anywhere I pointed it for a few seconds resulted in dry sections of hair.  That's how good this dryer is.
I am very impressed with this Allure professional hairdryer!Upon arrival it was packaged in a nice black matte box, with stylish decoration and writing. Hair dryer was wrapped in a plastic covering, and has a black shiny finish and matte finish.This hair dryer is super quiet and performs very well. Very lightweight.There are 3 heat settings, and  2 fan settings, as well as a cool burst button.The cord is very long and heavy duty, which makes it nice to not be limited in cord length.It has an angled end for air that fits over the end of the blow dryer.The blow dryer works very fast. My daughter's hair usually takes about 8-10 mins to dry and that dry time has been cut in half! She is very impressed with this hair dryer.I love the tourmaline Ionic Ceramic blow dryer, it is very gentle on your hair.I'm very glad I was chosen to test and review this hairdryer from Xtava.
It works really well!
Item was the exact item as seem on the pictures. Came with all three extra pieces for blowing out the hair. Use it recently n it was good......I must say its very hot.  Good tool. Its just to see how long it will last. But no regrets in this purchase n I'm loving my dryer
Cord is way too short.  I can't hold it over my head when standing in my usual spot.  Also, it's not hot enough.  The hottest setting is more warm than hot.  It is lighter and quieter than most, but I still regret buying it.  I did not tried the attachments.  They went into the trash along with the box.
Seems great at first, but it's not great for long hair unless your unnaturally careful while using it. It's always a possibility that long hair can get sucked into the back end of a hair dryer, but because of the extremely small size, it happens extremely easily with this one. Especially if you flip your head upside down to dry it, you lose even more control. The first time it sucked some hair up, it lost significant drying force. The second time, it stopped working altogether. Not to mention the hair loss. It is, however, without a doubt, the most adorable hair dryer I've ever seen.
Love it.
I love this hair dryer.  It is very quiet but strong.  It puts out an amazing amount of heat.  The only negative thing I can say is that the buttons are right where my fingers are and sometimes I shut it off.
The powers is not as great as previous dryers I have owned. I bought it because it was pink & pretty. Wish I hadn't now.
The most awful hair dryer ever. Very Heavy and the hot almost burnt my hair. Make a light weight product Remington!!!
Great appliance for the price.
My old and expensive blowdryer that I received as a birthday present still ran but slowly. Hence, my new replacement. Would have been happy for an orange one but sadly Amazon sent me a yucky fuchsia dryer. At least, it works great and has more options than I thought. Great for someone always on the go!
Normally I would have rated this item as very high. However of the 3 Hair Dryers purchased, one was defective. While the hair dyer aspect worked, the green light (bottom left side) did not. This defect was not apparent until the Hair Dryer was installed. I understood this to be a good hair dryer, but a defection like this does not look good. I will be thinking twice about any future purchases of this Hair Dryer (regarding product quality) as I can't afford to have a defective unit installed. I had to give my customer a 40% discount because of this. NOT GOOD. Thank you, David
Have used this dryer in hotels and when my old dryer died, I purchased this one.  Have had it a few months now and absolutely love it.  It is the only dryer I have used that has both a low and a high fan volume on the cool setting in addition to the heat settings. It's mounted in the guest bathroom and everyone who has stayed with us have commented how great it is and how nice it looks.
i got this for my mother, her old one is going bad, she was so happy when i got it for her birthday. she's very happy with the product. thank you
Nice hair dryer for the price, but it wasn't anything special and seemed quite basic.  I didn't feel as though my hair dried any faster or looked any different than the old basic hair dryer I've been using for the past 5 years or so.  I do like the color and the fact that the cord is quite a bit shorter than the cord on my old hair dryer.
I am one of those lucky people who can achieve poker straight hair or curly hair just by the styling tool I use on the end of the blow dryer.  When I was given the opportunity to test this Ionic Hair dryer for quality, I was super excited.  There were many things I liked about this blow dryer.1.  I like the shape of the unit.  I was able to hold the dryer by both the shaft and the handle depending on my needs to get the best angle for all my hair.2.  It took about 1/3 less time to dry my hair than with my other blow dryer even though that one has more watts.  I'm not sure if it was due to the less drying time of the fact that this is an ionic dryer that my hair was less frizzy.  It's winter here in Indiana and I generally have to use argon oil on my hair after drying to tame the frizzies.  I did not have to use the oil after using this blow dryer.3.  It's extremely light weight and quieter than my previous dryer.4.  It came with both a diffuser and a concentration nozzle.  I use the diffuser when I want curly hair and the nozzle when I want to go straight and sleek.One thing I did notice is a burning smell the first time I used the unit.  By the time I finished drying my hair though, the smell was gone.  Overall, I am very impressed with the quality and results of this Rimini Xtava.
I really really wanted to like this hair dryer, even ordered again after sending back the first one that arrived without the concentrator nozzle. After reading all the great reviews raving about the quality of the hair dryer I was somewhat disappointed with it.. It's really powerful, I think even to the extent that it can over-dry and damage certain type of hair if one is not careful, so I'm sure it will dry hair in a shorter period of time, but I still have doubts about it being ceramic and using ionic diffuse technology which makes hair less frizzy and damages less, as I found no mention of it on the hair dryer, the box itself or the paper insert that comes with it.  The hair dryer has somewhat cheap and plastic feeling.. the seams are somewhat poorly made- they scratch your hand when you touch them, and the cold shot button is not a real button per se, it's a piece of plastic hanging there, which I think can get stuck in or broken after some use.. Anyway, it's an OK hair dryer for the price, very powerful, deserving the title Professional, but somewhat cheaply made.. I guess it makes it easier to write raving reviews about a product if you don't pay for it, but for the price you can get a little less powerful but higher quality product
This is nice.....
wife loves it
great dryer... I just wish the cord wen further up into the retractable handle.
Too big and heavy.  Needs to be permanently mounted in order to be truly useful.
DAUGHTER LOVES IT
DANGEROUS!!!This hair dryer is SO NOT WORTH YOUR $$$$!!!  As reported by other reviewers the flat sliding on/off switch was difficult to operate, especially if your hands were not totally dry.  The folding handle stopped staying open after 6mo.  This created a significant pinching hazard.  After 9mo the dryer began to over heat each time it was used.
very good
I love this hair dryer! It comes with two attachments which help keep the heat damage to hair at a minimum. The design is aesthetically pleasing and easy to use. It heats evenly and does a fantastic job. It is high quality for a great price. I recommend this product.
Great Purchase!!
amazing
Bought for my girlfriend and she proclaims its the best she has ever owned.
just okay.
AMAZING!
okay product
It works, but the switch is really cheesy.
I like the xtava hair dryer. It work good and I don't have any problem with it.  This hair dryer has two speeds and 3 heat settings that is good so you can control how much heat you need. This dryer comes with attachment to help dry your hear directly on the spot that you need and not making the rest of your hair frizzy. For my straight thick hear the dryer works very good and I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts and opinions.
love the product great service
Love this hairdryer so much I have an extra one in my guest bathroom!
wooooooooooow !!!!!  This baby dries hair in a blink of an eye.  I am a cosmetologist and Blowouts / Blowdries are my salons main ingredient this thing save me 10-15 minutes, (in a salon, this means more clients and more money).  I told a colleague of mine and now we are ordering more.  Hopefully this product can be as good as the first day for a while.    Ps, I just placed a second order for 2 more.
This is a great hairdryer. Very pleased, even if it is a slight pink.
Great blow dryer!  Does a wonderful job. Will not buy another brand.
This is a great unit. Compact put full of power.  I wish this was the standard unit used by hotels.  Highly recommended.
Only last for one year.
This is a really nice hair dryer, the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that its a little heavy for me.  It dries nicely and very quiet compared to any other dryers I have had.  I will definitely keep it, I can use the workout.
Can't bla the company but this item does not work. It falls off with the suction cups and can cause issues. Save your money.
The dryer looks good and works. I ordered this because a friend's recommendation. Honestly, I feel it is a bit overly expensive. I was hoping my hair would be smooth and shiny after use but the outcome was not that great. Plus, there is no English manual, only Japanese one. A bit frustrated.
Loud like most hair dryers. I like the temperature setting and retractable cord. Air flow very good.
I purchased this unit when the more expensive hair dryer I had purchased from Staples online had a bonnet that would not have fit the head of a tiny baby....let alone an adult with curlers in her hair!  this dryer is very lightweight and doesn't put out very hot air but it is sufficient to dry your hair (just takes a little longer) and the price was great.
Well i first wrote this product was AMAZING, until having it for a few months.  This hairdryer keeps on shutting off !!! Soooo annoying!  Prob not even real BaByliss
XTAVA Rimini iconic hair dryer.is 1800 w .which is perfect for extremely good results for styling and drying your hair with in short period of time.it helps ur hair hair from getting frizzier and more dry looking by different speed for air blow and two power buttons .also contains two attachments.which can be used for focussed precise area u need to style or dry .without affecting the remaining part of the hair.after using the second attachment I am surprised to see the difference in my hair as it looks more shinier and don't forget to use the cool feature after you done drying your hair it gives such a finished look to the hair keeping it more natural and free flowing.i have tried other XTAVA PRODUCTS too like allure and i must say XTAVA.

I did my research before buying a new hairdryer and this one fits the bill without having to spend $1-200.  It works well
Excellent
the quality of this dryer is outstanding! I will save alot of money and time doing my hair with this equipment without the need of the salons...A+
I love this blow dryer. It is so much more powerful than the one I have been using and gets my hair dry in half the time (the box says 80% of the time but I swear it seems faster than that). I can't believe I have been wasting time drying my hair when there have been products on the market like THIS that will get it done so much faster. Until now I didn't realize there was a difference but I swear there is. When I use this blow dryer my hair seems more voluminous than when I use my old one. This is also very lightweight and sleek, not to mention the fact that it is quiet. I couldn't believe how quiet it was! If you are looking for a professional blow dryer I would highly recommend this one. This product was provided to me for testing and quality evaluation.
Second one of this week, works great.
I would have gone with 0 stars if I had that option. I gave this to my daughter for her semester in Spain. She said it overheated this first time she used it and has been afraid to use it again. So this product was basically a complete waste of money. The bad part is I got an email saying the first one I ordered wasn't coming so I ordered a second. The first one came as well as the second. I didn't need a blow dryer to use in the states so now I have one that can't be used and I that I don't want
Fast shipping and undamaged.
This hairdryer is light yet powerful.  My first one lasted over 15 years, I'm hoping this one lasts as long or longer!
I absolutely love this hair dryer. It's super cute, sleek and looks professional. It has a lot of functions and it drys my hair fast.
Fast dryer. a lil nosey but is good for drying.  recommend it to anyone looking for a portable hair dryer
Exactly as expected. Good value.
VERY powerful, and with 3 heat settings, and two speed settings, this has everything the pro's want .... A very well made product that is built to last ... I give it the highest rating.
This works very well.  It's my second Conair, and I think I will enjoy using it.
powerful and adjustable
Stopped working in 5 weeks
Very good works welll
Nice product.....works great
I really needed a new dryer and I'm glad I picked this one! It has great power and I like the folding handle.
Works great!
My wife is very happy!!
I absolutely love this hair dryer. I did a lot of research as to what people where saying was the best hair dryer nowdays and it consistenly showed this one! I love the high pressure and the different settings. My hair is silky and definitely not frizzy by the end of a hair drying session. :)
works great. abundant heat. quieter than its predecessor.
Wife loves it!
I purchased the product for its retractable cord and this did not work. Would not recommend
I got them on time, so credits to Amazon Prime for being fantastic.Unfortunately, the product was defective and didn't work at all. The material used is very cheap, flimsy plastic and the weight of it is disturbingly light. I do not recommend this product even for people who rarely use their hair dryers.
This hairdryer is great. I bought it because we recently moved and I couldn't find my hairdryer in the sea of boxes. ( I've had mine a long time so it was also a good excuse to get a new one.) I have fine thin hair. This hairdryer not only dries my hair very quickly but it gives it a lot of volume that I really need. I'm very happy with my purchase. I realize now how lousy my old dryer is.
I have baby fine hair that takes forever to dry. Every morning, I spend about fifteen minutes blow-drying my hair with a regular dryer before I flat-iron it. After I tried this dryer for the first time, my hair was dry within seven minutes. I used the diffuser to prevent frizz and lifted my roots as I dried it. It gave my hair some extra bounce and body. I did not use any styling products except for a heat activated repair cream that I always use.  This is the only blow dryer I will use from now on and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a faster dry time.I was provided a free product for review purposes but it does not alter my opinions. I was not compensated in any other way.
Now This is what u call a blow dryer
The collapsible handle, the stow away cord, the power of the motor, all these features make this hair dryer really great. Price was right, too!  Highly recommend!
Substantial and stylish. Works well.
This dryer works great.  Only complaint is that it is a little bulky.That being said ...... My wife loves it.
very happy and really impressed with my new xtava iconic hair dryer! i have curly hair that is difficult to straighten and that is ok! with this hair dryer and the diffuser i am able to achieve beautiful curly hair that is soft and bouncy with no frizzies. i love how it has different setting from no heat to hot and low air to a lot, so i have the options i need and want for achieving any hair style i want! today i decided i wanted my hair to look sleeker and was totally able to do so with the directed tool and a round brush! i have loved giving you all my review and opinions in exchange of complementary product.
First of all, this blow dryer is extremely light.  Surprisingly light even. If you have long hair (or a lot of it), that is something you will surely appreciate.  It also has a very powerful motor so that you can get the job done in no time at all.  If you are like me at all you need to get your hair dry as fast as possible in the morning so you can get on with your day.  And not 'frizzy' dry as many blow dryers are good at accomplishing....but sleek and sexy dry.  The diffuser nozzle of this product makes that possible for me.  It stays on securely while drying my hair and diffuses the air just enough that my hair no longer 'frizzies' up.Some tips on using the diffuser:1: apply your choice of hair products2: allow your hair to dry 75% before using the diffuser (if you are in a rush, use regular blow dryer first without nozzle)3: use clips if you want to add volume at the crown of your head4: if you have time, use the cool setting to dry your hair with the diffuser.  If not enough time, use medium to ensure your hair will not frizzI am truly honored that I was offered the opportunity to review this product at no cost to me.  Every once in a while you just know you have a winner on your hands, and this is such a product.  Stylish, effective, fun and extremely light.Highly recommended.*product received free or at a discount in exchange for my review
So far so good. Powerful. Does make my thin hair look more volumn.
works great, sometimes cord re winder does not rewind all the way which can be a little frustrating. I had a model similar that lasted many years so when it died I bought this and it works the same and has the same issues with the cord winder. However I still like it very much as it does blow alot of air which is why bought it again.
This midsize but powerful dryer is a game changer. I LOVE it! I have layered, waist length hair that becomes a frizz mess if not blow dried properly. The Volare V2 dries my hair smooth and silky. I've been using Sedu 6000 which blows too strong and gets really hot surges that smokes my hair. V2 has the perfect combination of heat and airflow, and the cool temp actually blows cool air. My hair dries and styles faster with the V2 than the Sedu. Made in Italy. Four year warranty. My search for the perfect dryer is over.
works great
I've had this hair dryer for 3 years now and it works great. I'm very surprised by reading some negative reviews. I have never had any problems with my hair dryer. My hair is very fine so it gets the job done in 5 minutes. My only complaint is that it's a little loud for me cause I have a baby that takes naps all the time. Other than that it's a great basic hair dryer,nothing fancy. Although I did buy mine at Walmart cause it was cheaper
Really great product for the money!
This is a fine hair dryer... I am sorry it is so large however as I have a tender shoulder...  That makes it hard to use at times... The dryer however is a good one.
My mom wanted a small and powerful hair dryer and when she opened this on Christmas day she was quite excited!
I was in the market for a diffuser, and I never bought one before... I will say this is the first and last diffuser I will ever buy. I'll stick with a regular hair dryer with a diffuser on the end.The heat in this isn't as hot as I would like it to be, compared to my normal hair dryer that gets really hot. I had to diffuse my hair on low, and this wasn't hot enough. Also, the low power was too low and the high power was too high. I also did not like how the air circulated in circles compared to the air coming out of a regular hair dryer in a straight motion. The circular motion blew all of my curls out (think if it like a fan you use to cool your house), and I don't have that happen on my regular blow dryer. I will say, that my natural curls are not very tight, and my goal when diffusing my hair is to help maintain my curls with a low heat... This did not cut it at all.. Not hot enough, and the way that the air circulated blew my curls out. I'm not sure if it is just this product or if it includes other diffusers like this as well... but I am sticking to my normal hair dryer with diffuser attachment!
By far the best hair dryer I've used and for the price is definitely worth getting one of these bad boys!  Make sure to clean the back every now and then just place against your vacuum hose to get excess hair and debris!
my all time favorite dryer!
It came without instructions.  Works okay.  Nothing above average about it.
Very happy
Not the drying power expected
Miss the Cool Shot feature of my cheaper dryer, don't feel like it gets as hot either.
Yea
Great service, very nice blow dryer.
The dryer is great; great temperature control too and very quiet. This is very important since I live in an apartment.  My only complaint is that the timer should also be quiet. It is constantly ticking (it's not loud but you notice) when in use so you hear it especially when you're in the dryer. When the dryer is finished it dings that it's done and it can startle you if you are not expecting it. I just have to get used to the ticking timer but in general I am very happy with the dryer.
This is a great, powerful and affordable hair dryer. It really shortened dry time significantly. I purchased one for my daughter, but ended up getting 2 more for me and my mom. We all love it.
Description stated this product was powerful and had the cool shot option. It does not have a cool shot option, and is far from powerful.
this hair dryer works very well. this a very inexpensive hair dryer and I have been told it will not last very long. i do not use it to dry my hair(buzz cut). i use it for household projects, when i need to dry whatever i am working on. most recently, i used it to adhere plastic over my windows to keep out the draft during the winter. once in awhile you need a hair dryer in the house, even though you do not use it to dry your hair. this hair dryer is powerful and will do the job.
My daughter and I are fighting over this hairdryer! We both tired it out and love it.It is black, not a silver color as in the picture; very sleek in design. It is lightweight to handle with a thick black cord. I knew this was going to be a powerful dryer as soon as I took it out of the box.It is listed as 2200W and it does not disappoint. My daughter has thinner, straight hair. It took us minutes to dry her hair on a medium heat setting. The high heat setting is VERY HOT. We did not use it.I have thick, coarse, curly hair. A few minutes on medium heat and a low air setting and I was good to go.We were given the opportunity to test and try this dryer. Based on our experience and our different hair styles, we both love this dryer and stand behind it based on its quality and construction.We love the design and the heat/ air flow settings. This is a powerful , well designed dryer that will last for a long time.
So far this hair dryer is great. Last year I purchased a conair one similar to this, and it seemed to over heat easily. I like the fact that this one has a low,medium, and high setting. The attachments that came with it are pretty good. I know a lot of people were complaining about the brush being too soft,  and I can see why they say that. Fortunately my hair isn't that thick, so the soft brush works fine for me.
It works really well!  best thing I have bought so far!
I am very picky with my hair. I've only used hair dryers $100+ so buying this one was a huge risk for me! I have very long, straight hair that without any heat comes out wavy and sometimes frizzy. This hair dryer is quieter than my old one and definitely dries my hair pretty fast. My only problem with it is that the attachment falls off occasionally and the cord is insanely short.
Great dryer for my hair.  Felt drying time faster
muy bueno
Love it.. small hands and it is very good and lasts a long time.
Very unhappy with this dryer. I wanted to return it, but between a restocking charge and postage it just isn't worth the trouble.  The dryer is much larger than it looks and would stick out from the wall approximately 6 inches.  It will go into the donation box!!!  Don't order it!!
works
Good
exelente
I have never used a hair dryer that could dry my long hair in under 30 minutes until I tried this one !(: this works amazingly and I love the way this hair dryer looks , so sleek looking . I would recommend this item to anyone who is looking For an affordable, well working hair dryer !!
does the job
Best blowdryer.Hair will be dry in record time. Only wish the concentration nozzle was permanently attached.
For the price, you can't beat it. Simple to use - no adjustments beyond  Low - Off - High. What more can a person want!
I'm not sure why the wide range of reviews. I bought this for my wife who has thin blonde hair. Before buying it for her, I noted that many reviewer said it worked for them and they had thick dark hair. There were also reviews of people saying it was way under powered and wouldn't dry their hair. So I can't figure out whether the quality varies from hairdryer to hairdryer or if the raving reviews are bogus. But, the hairdryer my wife received was too weak and took over an hour to dry her shoulder length hair.
Had it for only a few months and it already is losing it's heating element. Also the dial to change the heat doesn't work. The attachments are flimsy and get stuck easily. I can't wait for it to completely break so I can buy one that works properly. I wish I read all of the reviews for this product. Never again will I make that mistake.
Do not get hot enough and a little smaller than what I thought.
Bueno
I noticed less static in my hair after the first time of using! I also notice more body if I use moose. It is a little heavier than a normal hair dryer but I have no problem putting up with that if it makes my hair look better! I also thought the price was great compared to other dryers of its likeness.
Love the temperature...does not blow too hot. Getting use to the button locations.
this is a great dryer for my curly frizzy long hair. makes it smoothe
good
Love it!
works!
Love it it dries my hair beautifully
I received this hair dryer for review and testing purposes.This hair dryer is heavy but it packs a lot of heat and did not make my hair frizzy.I have wavy hair and I washed it, put a repair cream on ,then toweled dried it and put the dryer on low speed and it was drying my hair fairly quickly. I used a vented paddle brush to blow dry and then I put it on the second higher heat setting until I finished the process. After that I pressed the cool shot button and it came out cold. I felt like I was a holding a salon quality dryer at home. I give this product 5 stars!
Awesome
Four stars....might upgrade this to 5 in the next month or so.  This is a good little unit, perfect for travel or light use.  The first one overheated after 3-5 minutes of use, I was able to exchange it with the vendor, and the replacement unit seems to work perfectly.  Once its used a few more times, I'll either upgrade the rating or comment below.  Not a bad dryer overall, and it comes with 2 attachments.  A pokey thing, and a duck bill thing.
I like it, but it doesn't really sound like a normal hair dryer, it sounds more like a vacuum.
So far, so good!  Much better than my previous Hot Tools that blew up.  It is heavier, but dries my hair faster and with less tangles.
It never worked. Not dual voltage as it is said to be. Will never buy any electric item from Amazon again. Epic waste of my money
not as strong as i would like it to be
I have a vacation rental close to a nationally known hike/bike trail and many of my guests are here for recreational activity.  In 3 years, I've only had to replace one of these units and everybody seems to love them.
Brush is a bit soft, but good product
Wife likes very much. Been in use 3 months still going strong.
died after about 6 months of use
Favorite dryer ever!
Even though I just got this week, I used on both my daughters hair to blow out for the first time!!! I bought this because I remembered my former stylist using this tool on my hair years ago!  I saw the price and jumped on it!  It's not fancy but it has four settings from cool to high heat and if you know how to use a blow dryer properly then you should be fine!  Thanks Amazon for having st half the price as Walmart! :). Worked like s charm on my girls and I only used cool and warm heat! ;) they have lots of curly hair!
Comes in handy 4 travel or a quick fix it.
So I tested my new Allure 2200w hair dryer and so far I really like it. It dries my long hair in no time and and it doesn't leave my hair frizzy. It is lightweigth and it looks nice. The chrome looking lint trap at the back can be twisted easily and pulled out for cleaning. It looks nice but be very careful because (correct me if I am wrong)  it is made out of a plastic material that seems like it will easily break. I am going to use and keep this hair dryer in the bedroom vanity just incase I drop it, it will fall on the carpet floor. The extra attachment that came with it is also nice. I also have a 1875w Conair infinity that I have been using for years. I love it but I compared the two today and they seem to blow about the same amount of air. If Allure is blowing harder, I cannot really tell. The small button to press cool air is a bit hard to press but truth is, I never use the cool air function anyway so it dont really matter for me. Over all, I will start using this Allure from now on and will give him hubby the Conair one. The other minor things does not hindrance the funtionality of this hair dryer so if you are planning to buy this, go ahead, give it a try. I think you will like it too.
Will be perfect for Greece.  Just change setting to 220/250 and plug in to adapter.
Great hair dryer.  In addition to its useful purpose, I like the retracting cord so that when the dryer is put into a drawer, the cord is not getting into everything else in the drawer.
It is very nice ! Motor sounds are not cheep dryer at all. It is very powerful. Especially my long hair !! I am so satisfied with this item.But only I don't think I need that it call Skin (make moisture to your face ) dial. I don't think it working noticed in the US, because Japan are more humidity country but not in the US.
I love this hairdryer! It dries my hair in well over HALF the time my old one did. The removable back allows you to clean all the lent and stuff that gets in there over time. It's perfect, and it comes with a ton of attachments.
I am so in love with this hairdryer. My hairdryer gave out recently so I was on the hunt for a new one. I purchased one in the store for double this price and I was not satisfied with it. It left my hair frizzy. One of my favorite things about this hairdryer is the slanted handle. It fits perfectly in my hand and it's just the right angle to dry my hair without twisting my hand. Another great thing about this hair is that it really does dry your faster. I am really amazed by how fast it dries your hair and does not leave you with a frizzy head. I can actually use the high speed and not make a mess of my hair. I love the 3 temperatures. Most hairdryers offer heat with the option of the cold button that you have to hold down. This hairdryer not only has the cold press button, but also high heat, low heat, and cool. So you don't have to hold down the cold button because the cool button is cold enough. I like to start out on high heat all over then I divide my hair and use low heat. After drying is complete, I like to set my hair with the cool option. The concentrator nozzle is just the right size. You can also remove the screen on the back of the hairdryer for easy cleaning. This is an amazing hairdryer. I love that I got the opportunity to test this hairdryer in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion. I would definitely recommend this hairdryer!
It is the best hair dryer!
Was as described and worked well.
I purchased this for a professional hair stylist with ten years experience.  This is the best dryer she's used thus far.  The price was amazing, less than half of what I almost paid locally.  Drying hair with this is much like aiming your head at a turbine engine with very high velocity constant airflow and heat, it dries hair in about 1/3 the time of others she's used.  I'm very satisfied with this purchase.
It works well, it's a blowdryer.
Quit after a few months.  I bought this blow dryer because the one I was using was 10 years old & could reasonably be expected to die soon.  The old one is still working.  This one is dead.
I hate blow drying my hair. Its long and thick and my arms are hurting because it takes so long to get everything dry. I can't ever get a style to hold. I tried a blow out once. Once. So when I was given the opportunity to review this product for free I thought what do I have to lose?Thats when I realized ive always just had a crappy blowdryer. The cord is super long and thick so it doesn't get very tangled during use and I have freedom of movement. The power is really amazing. It only took about 10 minutes give or take. I appreciate the warm setting because heat dries my scalp out. The blast of cool air made my hair shiny. The nozzle was great for taming frizz. This dryer has made blow drying my hair less of a chore. I can't wait to try my next blow out!
I am very happy with my new dryer from Xtava...my previous ones were revlon (both the same model)...the first one got pitched because the cord was becoming severed from the dryer...the second because it started making a horrible noise and sparked at me!  As long as this new one doesn't do that, I will be happy!! I hope it lasts a long time!  It's a cute design, I have the blue flower.
It is a very good item . Very easy  to switch on.. Perfect.
Not as strong as i expected
This replicates the same dryer I had for years but finally bit the dust.  Long time Conair buyer.
I like this dryer but it is a little bit larger than I wanted.  Work really well and is not too loud.
I had to have a hair dryer so I could dry my Silky Terrier's long fine hair after her bath. I needed a dryer that was lightweight because several years ago I hurt my hand and it's hard for me to hold a heavy hair dryer for very long. This is perfect. It's very lightweight, small and easy for me to hold. I love this hair dryer and don't mind using it, as it doesn't hurt my hand at all.
Love it. Now my hair looks like I just left the salon. Quick dry time and great sheen
absolutely in love with my new XTAVA professional ionic ceramic hair dryer! i really got the results i was looking for. as i am reviewing for free, after washing and conditioning i towel dried my hair and combed out. i then proceeded to use my round brush to blow out my hair and it worked out very nicely! i really like just how well built it is, looks and feels very durable and high quality. i also love the settings as well, hot high heat down to low cool air, it's perfect! i highly recommend for anyone who is looking to achieve ultra stylish do's to those just looking to dry their hair in the morning. this XTAVA hair dryer will not disappoint! i am so happy to have had this opportunity to present my review to you out there,
I used this dryer while at a Renaissance Suites and loved it. When I returned home, I looked it up online and ordered it. I'm just as pleased with it as I was with the one at Renaissance Suites because it is lightweight, quiet, and efficient.
Sturdy, a bit bulky & gets incredibly hot. So if buying for salon use be careful when using with bleach on high heat. It gets VERY HOT.
My wife loves it! Uses it ALL THE TIME! Thank you
nice
I love this hair dryer! This is by far the best hair dryer i have ever used. First i would like to say that alot of hair tools claim to be professional but aren't really, but this hair dryer gives the look, feel and performance of a professional tool. It comes nicely packaged in a sturdy box and the dryer itself has a great looking sleek design. It has a thick long cord. It dries hair so much faster than what i have used in the past and i love that it offers different speeds and heat settings.I also really like the concentrator nozzle to use to focus on certain areas. Overall i am really impressed with this hair dryer and would definitely recommend it. I am so glad I was given the opportunity to try out this product at no charge and share my opinions about it.
is holding up well, i enjoy that the warm is enough to dry thick hair
Best hair drier I have ever owned!
I had expected a cordless dryer.....that is what I had asked for. I returned the product
Wife loves it and says its one of the better dryers that she has used..
For how inexpensive this hair dryer was, I was a little worried about the  quality, but  this is a great hair dryer!  It is quality made, and actually the best hair dryer I have ever had! It dries the hair quickly without getting too hot, or too cold...It is Just right!
Didn't like the buttons. I've returned it. I'm giving 3 stars not 1 because I used to have Conair Hair Dryer and it was quite good.
Great price, dries hair fast, great for winter days, lots of speed and heat options. Only the bilious orange color might be an issue.
Great dryer !!!!
This blow dryer is awesome! It uses tourmaline ionic technology for drying, which I was looking for. It dries my hair with less damage compare to other form dryers. Rimini 1500W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Professional Hair Dryer is inexpensive. It comes with concentration nozzle and customized diffuser. It is lightweight and the quality worth higher end hair dryers. It has cold shot button, 3 level heat button, and high and low power settings. I am pleasantly surprised by how good it works! It dryers my hair in half the time as my old dryer and my hair is so smooth and soft. No more frizzies. This product was provided for review by by Xtava.
Love this hairdryer! I have very thick hair and lots of it so it takes a long time to dry. But it takes less than five minutes with this hairdryer. There's one attachment that comes with it which diffuses the air wide and i use it to give more volume. I realized how miserable my drying experience was before this purchase. Well deserve 5 star rating!
I bought this hair dryer because I wanted a cooler setting for drying my hair without holding down a cool setting and trying to manipulate the dryer on my hair. This dryer does an amazing job in drying my hair without the damage that hot air does to my hair. Cool air actually makes hair appear shiny and closes the follicles making the hair seem healthier.
super fast hair drying time without the frizz!  So much better than the dept store options for the same price or even more...very happy
I bought this hairdryer ...twice ...for the retractable cord.  On the  first one I received the cord didn'tretract at all so I returned it and asked for a replacement. I  figured it was a fluke. Replacement was only slightly better. Cord retraction was rough and sporactic. So I returned for a refund. Amazon arranged for the free return and pickup of both hair dryers. So I may have unhappy with the purchases but the return process was a very good experience! It is just a defective design...My husband picked up one at Target and the retractable cord didn't work on it either!
Great item.  Lightweight.  Very effective at drying the hair.  Highly recommend!
I spent a lot of time researching various dryers and was willing to pay around $100 to get a good one.  I was intrigued by this dryer because of the Tourmaline, Ceramic and promise to boost shine.  I was also drawn to this particular diffuser because of the long prongs.  I was turned off by the low price because I assumed it would be poor quality.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality.  The dryer is light weight, quieter than my former dryer and much more efficient.  I have long, curly and very thick hair.  This dries my entire head in 15 minutes without burning my hair.  My former dryer took 30 to 35 minutes and didn't give me the shine this one does.
[[VIDEOID:e5ff7a1f6cf2306e1ed10662c3a2720f]]My hair is so thick it used to take me almost 30 minutes to dry it even with the use of a hair dryer, until I used this professional ionic hair dryer! I love the precision the concentrator nozzle provides; allowing me to focus the heat exactly where I need it the most. This allows my hair to dry much faster since all the air is going directly where the hair is still wet. The nozzle is easy to attach just by pushing it on the hair dryer when it is powered OFF.The hair dryer has (2) speed settings and (3) heat settings, so if my niece wanted to use this she could *she has really thin hair so she doesn't need a high setting, or much heat*...I love the cold shot button, I use a big round brush to give a little curl on my bangs..I hold the brush in place; use the heat to give a shine and volume to my bangs and then I do a cold shot for a minute to lock in the look, sometimes adding a little hair spray before I use the cold shot..it works perfectly!I love the hook being attached to the hair dryer so I can hang it up when I am not using it..less clutter on my bathroom sink! This hair dryer is well made and absolutely my favorite one I have ever used. The cord is thick and sturdy which is great because it will not break as easily. I was provided a sample for evaluation and review.
Good, compact hairdryer.  Looks nice and works well.  I have short hair so set it on the lower volume.  Also, hardwired it to an outlet.  What I do not like about it is the night light.  It's too bright.  I think I am going to disable it.
Great hair dryer, light-weight & easy to hold. My one complaint is that the diffuser was quite difficult to attach & the instructions did not mention how to attach it. I had to read other reviewer comments for advice.
i bought this item and got it today and i did my rollers and all and i just loveeee the way it works! its small & the hood is really big to put rollers . i feel like i just came out of the salon. money well spent !
This is a great little hair dryer.  I  have chin length hair and it was perfect.  There is a lot of air coming out!! It comes with a little carry case, and several min-attachments. Very light weight.  It only has a high and a low setting - so there is no real temp control.
It is a good feel in my hand, and I suffer from carpel tunnel syndrome. I can hold it with a solid grip. The one reason it is not five stars for me is the cord. Although the angle of it looks like a good idea, it can sometimes get in my way when I am trying to work with a round brush on the back of my head. However,  I am very satisfied with my purchase, because the heat options, air flow settings, weight, sound, and looks are all attractive and smooth. It has not smoked, over-heated, or gotten too heavy while I have been using it. I can have it on and my boyfriend can still sleep in the bed, with a closed door as the only seperation between us. Arguably, he is a heavy sleeper. Overall, I am happy and plan to use my complimentary discount code on another product from this friendly company.
Pro: it has a very fast Cool cycle - something I've always wished for in other dryers. Cons: The controls are very difficult for me to work with the machine running - the placement is maybe made for a bigger hand, but I can't reach the cool button comfortably when I'm using my right hand. The diffusor is very hard to attach, and even harder to detach.  And this one is my fault - I just assumed that all dryers came with a concentrator, but this one doesn't. I tried attaching the concentrator  from my Revlon dryer that just stopped working, and it doesn't fit. (Shouldn't they be universal?) Unfortunately I threw out all the packaging after I checked to make sure it worked upon delivery. Otherwise I would return it.
Works wonderful and fast. But the cold press button got unglued. Powerful great for gym.
My gf loves it. She says it does no damage to her hair and she uses no heat protection treatment.
dries quickly
exact replacement for what my wife has used for years
Works well and is very portable.
Power and great tangle proof retractable cord.
There's a lot of low reviews for this hair dryer and most are because it's loud. Yes, it is loud. I don't use a hair dryer to style my hair I just want it to dry it as quickly as possible. I have long hair to my lower back, its (mostly) straight and very fine hair. I part my hair in the middle. Then turn it on to the highest speend and hot. I dry my left side in 5 mins then my right side- another 5 mins. This is the 3rd time I've bought this hair drier. The 1st one died when I dropped it. R.I.P. The second one just died after 5 years... It wouldn't heat up. 5 years for $20.. That's a good deal to me. If you're looking for a fancy hair dryer to carfeully and (apparently) silently... continue looking. If you're looking for a hair dryer that will dry your hear in 10-15 mins (if you have thick hair) then this one could be it.
Wife loves it! Great bank for the buck!
Had to switch it to the higher setting for my wife's needs, but it's working OK. We'll see in the future, as some reviews question it's durability.
Very happy so far, I haven't owned this very long but it seems to work very well, it has a lot of settings so I can always find what I need for my hair.
Great product, can't beat that price!
worked ok for a little while, then the power and heat went out.
Best, most powerful blow dryer ever!
Works good
Light weight and small and great power...very pleased with this little dryer.  Bought it for travel but may end up using for every day.
1 year and still works great!  Excellent buy
I love this Allure professional Ionic ceramic hair dryer by Xtava!!! When I received this hair dryer in the mail I was so excited to test it out as my old hair dryer just crapped out the other day and I've been without a hair dryer. I'm in love with the design & quality of this hair dryer I love the sleek black design!!! This hair dryer is also made of high quality materials which is a plus for me as It needs to be able to last a long time. Its pretty light it weight compared to my old dryer with I love so it won't made my wrist tired since I have long hair that normally takes a long time to dry I need to be able to have a dryer that light enough to hold for a long time. This dryer includes a Concentrator Nozzle with I love and works amazingly!! This attachment is said to direct maximized condensed air flow to the area you are targeting, adding precision and focus while controlling frizz and style outcome which it definitely does!! It also seems to dry my hair a lot faster then my old dry with saves me time!!  It also has a 2 speed settings and 3 heat setting which  work wonders and are a great feature to have!!  I am really impressed with this dryer & I definitely would recommend this Hair Dryer by Xtava & brand to everyone !! I was so excited to receive this hair dryer from the company to test and share my opinion!!
Great blow dryer.
Plastic junk.  The speed and heat setting buttons are flimsy and hard to operate. Also the smell of the motor is awful.  On most dryers the smell abates after a few uses.  This one smells as if it's burning.
I love it, of course my husband used it before I did.  It does not burn me like other hair dryers, it does not frizz my thin hair.
Works Great!! I purchased this for my teenage daughter. She absolutely loves it:)
WAY TOO LOUD. Cord keeper is a nice touch but returned it to prevent hearing loss. Going back to using a hair band for the cord.
A great hairdryer. It seems to get my hair dryer faster than ones I've used in the past. The color is pretty too.
This blow dryer works great.  It never frizzes my hair and the temperature control settings are really nice! It is not too heavy and I can easily dry my long hair without getting a workout! I also really enjoy the color. Awesome product!
A far cry from the Remington hairdryer I have had for 10 years but an acceptable backup.  The diffuser is crap and the fan speed and heat settings are way too slow/low to dry as quickly as my previous dryer.  Another hairdryer to add to the collection bin.
This dryer replaced our old one, which finally gave up the ghost.  It is powerful and easy to control with the dual thumb-controlled switch which regulates heat and fan speed.
I had to send this product back because the heat holes in the dryer head are to high to dry the back and sides of my head.
I always come back to this model of hairdryer!  I've had a couple of these hair dryers over the years and I love them!  They last a long time, they are lightweight, the buttons are easy to use along with the cold shot button and they dry my hair quickly!  I've tried other hair dryers from Conair and returned them because they just didn't perform as well for styling my hair while blow drying.  The last model I tried was the Conair Infinity Pro which is twice the price of this model.  The nozzle WITHOUT the attachments was too narrow so I couldn't style my hair well plus it was very heavy!  I returned that one the same day and went back to this model because it has always worked well for me!  I won't stray again.  I actually purchased three of these since I noticed that now their is a new model of this hair dryer.  I would REALLY miss this one if they discontinued it!  Since these last a long time, I should be set for hair dryers now!  :)  It's a great performing hairdryer and the price is perfect!
They get very hot, love them.
Very pleased.
Works well. I have thin hair and it dries it quickly but I have body!
Funky wild color and works great on my curls!
This hairdryer worked OK for me but did not last too long.  It runs very hot on the high setting; I sometimes worried it might explode because it was soooooo hot.  Therefore, I mostly used the 2 lower settings.  One day, it quit altogether.  The one good thing about it: it was quieter than any other hairdryer I've ever owned.
This is the best hair dryer I have used in a long time. It's lightweight, easy to handle, and not bulky at all. It also is high-powered and dries my hair is less time than the dryer I was previously using. As someone with thick hair that is used to spending tons of time just drying my hair, this is a huge plus. The black color of the dryer is also sleek, and I like that it comes with the concentrator attachment. Product provided to facilitate this review, but all opinions are honest and my own.
Good
bought this for my daughter she has no complaints
very strong and powerful hair dryer. a little bit heavy, but i don't mind.
It did not work
has held up for over year now. i only use it about once a week though
Was purchased to use oversees. Compact and light. Works super fast and does the job!
ok
I have very long thick hair that is chemically straightened and high lighted. Usually I go through 2-3 hair dryers a year and never get my hair completely dry.... Until this dryer. It is AMAZING!!! Normally it takes 30-45 minutes for it to be somewhat dry -but not with this dryer. My hair was COMPLETELY dry in 15 minutes. Save yourself time and money and buy this dryer. My only regret is not buying it sooner! Great price and will definitely buy another to have as a spare.
LOVE THIS! I have 4c hair with a tendency to shrink almost 75%! This gets the job done! I also use this on my three daughters' hair, we all have 4a-4c with high shrinkage, and this is one tough dryer! The attachments hold on for dear life and still have not broken!
Love the fact that it really is hands-free, but it is quite a monstrosity! It took me awhile to find the correct height that I wanted it and the right bend, so I feel like I have to leave it up. Thank goodness it's not in my way TOO much, but it certainly is an eyesore.
Very nice, lightweight, seems to dry hair quickly without frying it. so far very nice, but time will tell how long it will last. great value so far.
i am completely satisfied, i have a long, strong, thick hair, and it works for me as good as  the proffessional blowers i used to have. I just hope it last. I like it very much. Good price, very light, even the colors of this hair blower are nice and they delivered on time. Thanks.
One of the best dryer for this price range. I like cold wave.
My second one. Love it but only hope it lasts a lot longer than the first one I bought. First one slowly died. Started to shut off sooner and sooner during dryings. Took it apart and found that the fan was rubbing on the housing inside and wore and cracked the fan. Became unbalanced inside and the fan speed slowed down causing it to overheat and shut down constantly.  If I could have bought a new fan blade I could have fixed it.
Very satisfied. Works great for frizz control.
U get what you pay for
I like it.
I agree with the other comments- I love how compact it is but was very disappointed with how heavy it is. It arrived in the original package but looked used. The dryer was just thrown in there without additional packaging. It also has a strong burning smell when drying that maybe wears away with more use. Lastly, do not buy if you are a Lefty. Just holding it I was able to switch the settings while drying my hair:(
A vey nice hair dryer!
Dries my long hair in about 10 minutes
Compact, folds,  and has great power. This is my second one, I purchased it to leave at the beach condo.
This is a really wonderful blow dryer! It seriously cut the time it takes to dry my hair in half! It was really lightweight and has a very sleek design. It comes with a removeable nozzle that centralizes  the heat that I really like. I am happy to recieve xtava's awesome blow dryer to review. I'm throwing the old one out for this!
This is truly the BEST blow dryer for naturally curly headed gals!!! Powerful yet gently on my curls and easy to use.  LOVE this product:)
Light weight and very good heat control
Very happy w this ourchase
My hairdryer is so old I think it has lost all its power so I stopped using it.  I saw a great promotion for this item and figured it was high time I got a new one!  As soon as it arrived this morning I jumped in the shower to wash my hair and used it and oh.em.geeeee it is great!  I have really curly hair (spiral curls in the back and looser curls up top) and the air director thingy (that is a technical term!) is so great!  I don't like to use  a lot of product in my hair but hate frizz- this seemed to seal the deal without having to use so much product my hair felt crunchy.  Today I have soft, bouncy, frizz free curls!!!  Now I need a new camera so I can show them off!
Works great!
I've been using this for about a week now. I previously had a Revlon with retractable cord that still worked, but it was REALLY hot. I have oily hair, so I have to wash it pretty much daily. The heat was killing my long hair. I took a chance on this and I am really glad I did. Initially, I was disappointed, but I am glad I stuck with it.1) Power! It has almost too much power for someone with long hair, my hair was FLYING all over the place (it also tangles easily). I added one of the 3 concentration nozzles and that really helped.2) Heat! Yes, its not super hot -- but heat isn't good either! It does start off rather cool, but it always heats up more about 30-60 seconds into blow drying. With as much power going through it, I don't think you need as much heat to accomplish getting dry hair.3) Buttons! Yes, the buttons are on the side. I think the reason most people complain about button placement is because they are so used to the position of their old hairdryers. It takes some time to get used to a new one. I think people notice the difference a lot at first, but it really will go away and you'll get used to it. It hasn't been an issue for me.Overall, I am pleased with this blow dryer. I can't say that my hair dries any faster than my previous dryer, but it will be much healthier in the long run and that's something I appreciate more than speed. It definitely does not take a long time by any means though. I am happy I got it!
Great product for coarse hair! I have a 4b texture and when I use the high setting with the fine tooth comb attachment, I get my hair very straight. The only reason why it doesn't get a full 5 stars is because of the placement of the cool button. If the button was a setting instead of at the back, the blow drier would be perfect.
Totally diggin my hair dryer.  Gift from hubby!  Needed something quiet that didn't wake up the kids.  2 levels of speed (low works as well as high, just more quiet), 2 heat levels, ions can be on/off, cool blast button, small, light, love!!!
as advertised
Great product. Fast shipping.
Works great.
After using the dryer twice my hair feels dry, lifeless, flat and flyaway. Maybe its the ionizing function of the dryer, but it really did a number on my hair. I've been using Conair dryers for years and years, and when my last hair dryer died I bought another Conair, thinking I'd get the same great dryer. In terms of the dryer itself, it is heavy, difficult to hold, and the cord is too short (especially if you have long hair and attempt to style using a brush). Due to the weight and the oddly shaped handle, I found it very awkward to use. The buttons that control the heat/speed are also located in an inconvenient spot on the handle, and they are sharp on the edges, which makes using the dyer even more uncomfortable. Unless you want your hair to be a lifeless dried-out mess, stay away from this dryer.
Ok this took about 10 ;minutes off the drying time of my hair as opposed to  using just a regular ionic hair dryer, but not ony that it leaves my hair (which isa bit past  shoulder legnth color treated grey hair with some slight curl) smooth and un frizzy.  I could actually dry it and wear it with out hot curlers or a flat iron, though I still prefer to use a flat iron for extra shine. I never believed that one hair dryer was much better than another but this one sure is. It is an investment in me and I am so glad I bought it.
I like it but the lady of the house would like a smaller one easier to manuver
very good!!
It's a great hair dryer, light, fairly quiet.
Bought as a gift and my mom loves it.
Excellent very responsible
very powerful blowdryer but doesn't fry my hair
Fits my hair dryer perfect, love it!
fast shipping, A++++++++++
Fast shipping. Awesome blowdryer.
very loud and have burning smell. from the first use you know it will die soon.
DO NOT BUY THIS HAIR DRYER.  I have very thick, strong, long hair, and this dryer BURNED OFF MY HAIR.  It is way too powerful and gets way way way too hot. I now have a giant chuck out my hair on one side. It also burned the plastic tips of my round brush. Disaster.
My curly hair, somewhat thick, used to take at least 30 min to dry (sectioning off and drying with a round brush). After that it would take me another 15 min to straighten and smooth it to get frizz out. This dryer dries my hair STRAIGHT without having to section it off. I don't even have to flat iron it afterwards!!!  It is smooth, straight, and frizz-less in under 10 min!  Amazing!  Will NEVER buy any other dryer!!
I bought it 3 months back. No problem at all. Serves well. Quickly dries my hair. I mostly use it in medium speed. It's a light weight dryer.
Love it. Have very long thick hair. Cut drying time almost in half. Did not frizz my hair as other dryers have in the past.
It is easy to use
I have owned this for a little over a year and it's been working on and off for a few months now. At first it was fine but I may need to replace it soon. I use this about 1-2 times a week. Longer when it worked for winter.
This works well and is easy to use, the cord from the base to the drier could be a little longer
Present for my mom and it's very good quality for price.
I'm so excited when I receive this item, and can't wait to try it. The product was shipped from Japan and took about 20 days to be delivered.
This dryer has great Hot/Warm/Cold settings and makes my hair shiny and not too dried out. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the switch to adjust the settings is difficult to push.
I have always loved the andis hairdryer but paid thirty some dollars for this and it only lasted couple months the switch quit working and the dryer would get so hot would shut off before could get my hair dry
Nice hair dryer for everyday & travel.Has on-going problems with the retractable cord.
This is AMAZING!  Dries my hair very fast and it's so shiny when I'm done.  The only negative is that it's pretty heavy, but I'll just chalk that up to an arm workout!  :)
Very lightweight, so great for long uses.
Light weight yet dries hair fast
Has a 110 or 220 setting so it's perfect for worldwide travel. Works with a plug adapter. No converter needed.
Broke after a month and a half :(
Nice and compact. It's a bit noisy, but I think that's a function of its size. The cord and plug are not as large as some, so it's footprint is small, which is exactly what I was looking for to travel to the UK. It's not lighter than my larger one but it will work just fine.
Dries my super thick hair faster than any other hair dryer I've owned.
This is great product!
EXCELENTE
Easy install.
These work great for motor homes and any close bathroom location.
Love it so far. No complaints that I've come across
Works well and has multiple heat settings and speeds.
very good dryer, nice power, not as heavy as the reviews I read previously.
Great blow dryer for my getting my wavy hair smooth.
I had same product before they changed the switches.  New switches are hard to adjust.  Other than that, it dries well.
When you brake your arm or can't use your  arm/hand and you only have one good hand! This is the best choice out there for you!
Love the convenience of having it on the wall and it works great.  It's the second one I've owned and I would buy an Oster again.
excellent
This dryer dries well.  The bonnet is small where it fits around the head. Placing a snall towel near the brow makes it more comfortable. Also restringing it so it fits an adult head.  The bonnet smells like plastic for several uses, but now smells better after I took it out and let it sit without being folded up in the case.  Good compact drying with great drying power.
used in Italy and was great
Terrible blow dryer!!! It caught fire rite after I turned it on!!! You get what you pay for with this dryer, LITERALLY!!!!!
High wattage drys hair very fast
This dryer is amazing!!! Used it for the first time today. Leaves hair very soft and no frizz. It is a little heavier than a normal hair dryer, but I love it!!!
For an inexpensive hairdryer it fills my needs. I use it when I travel, I would love for it to bea bit smaller and lighter, but that may not be possible considering the existing features.
Perfect!
Works very well. Just got it about 3 months ago and have been traveling with it with a converter and it is still working well and doesn't leave my hair too frizzy.
Absolutely loved it.  Until it quit working.  After six weeks the low setting was just a slight puff of wind.  The high setting then had as much power as the low setting had previously when it was working properly.  At the same time, the hot setting became so incredibly hot that the coils inside glowed bright orange.  So I started using the warm setting.  It's now completely worthless.
I love this hair dryer!! I have long, thick  hair, and it only takes about 10 min to dry it!!! I used to spend about 25 min just drying my hair and another 15 min styling it. I've reduced that time to just 15 min. What's not to like?
It works and makes her happy: 5 stars.
it has something wrong!! Graduated from spark fire
This is really heavy, pretty quiet for the size
This a good hairdryer. I use it as my everyday dryer. It is a bit heavy for packing if weight is an issue.
Excelente.!
Amazing! Gets hot and works perfectly. The price is right and this product will get plenty of usage. I'm in love 
I am very pleased with this product and the price.I bought it so I could give my hair hot oil treatments and it has been great. Heat distributes throughout cap and it's easy to use and store.
I have to say, this dryer is amazing! I have long, thick  hair, and I use a hair dryer a few times a week with a round ceramic brush to straighten it. My hair is softer, the blow out lasts longer, and it dried faster then my old dryer. Must buy! If it works on my difficult to straighten hair, it will definitely work on anyones! The Allure features two speeds and three heat settings to offer control and professional styling versatility for all hair types. it allows you to pick the speed and heat you want without damaging your hair. Very powerful, sturdy, leaves hair soft, dries quickly, not too loud, and aesthetically pleasing. No breakage. Satisfied with the results. Attachments work well. i received a free sample in exchange of my honest opinion.
Third time is a charm!  I was looking to replace my hair dryer and the last two I tried were so loud.  This one is great! Yay!
works excellent
I bought this to use when travelling because of it's compact size. But it works so well I've been using it everyday.  The cord stores easily inside the  handle and the temperature is perfect -- not too hot and not too cool. I added the attachment and found it performs better with it on. Has great power and doesn't make my hair frizzy or staticy. The only complaint I have is the strong plastic smell when I first opened the box. I've used it for a week now and I don't smell it anymore. I really do love this hairdryer.
love it!
New to hair dryers but does everything it should and a bit more.
works great, looks cool
I have owned a couple of these hairdryers.  They work great for 3-4 years before they get noisy.  For the cost and the convenience it can not be beat.
Worth it! I'm so glad I listened to my hairdresser when he recommended this hair dryer. Obviously, he uses his multiple times each day and his lasts for years. It really did cut down my drying time. Only negative is the weight. I don't mind it as I'm using it - it's an other arm workout :) it's when I travel with it that makes me wish it was lighter. I'm always to the weight limit on my checked bags so this goes into my carry on and it's another workout! Still love it and would recommend it.
mi friend loved it
This dryer BY FAR IS THE BEST EVER!!!! I have really long hair extensions and they take FOREVER to dry, and after reading the reviews for this dryer I decided to try it because they say drying in half the time.They weren't kidding, this dryer is AMAZING to say the least, I have never owned such a great product that is so inexpensive; so do yourself a favor, purchase this dryer, you wont be sorry, it is truly the best! Even on cool or medium speed this thing is magnificent! Some of the reviews comment on this dryer being heavy, I'll share a secret...cheap dryers are superlight weight, but in all sincerity, this dryer is not heavy at all, so not sure why some reviews say this. The button placement was an issue when I read the reviews but decided to try it for myself, and what I personally found was, where I place my hand is at the bottom anyways, so it was a non issue for me. It's totally worth trying because everyone is going to hold their dryer in a different spot anyways, and if I didn't purchase this based on what others said about weight and button placement, I would have missed out on the BEST DRYER EVER, and believe me, I have tried them all. And side note, it really does dry in half the time, which means an extra 20 mins in the morning hitting the snooze button ; )
Works good .
This thing has almost as much hot air as a politician! With adjustable temperature settings, variable wind intensity and an off switch, this thing is 20 times more responsive than any political figure currently in office.Temperature variations are modest, little chance of frying your skin. Controls are a little cumbersome/awkward but it works, and I don't usually need to shift around much during drying incidents.Air power is effective, if not stunning. Good for drying hair, not good for blowing large spiders across a tile floor (limited cord reach and range of power). Absolutely terrible for flying kites with small dogs attached.I think maybe I'd enjoy seeing a laser sight attachment so I can focus drying power on specific strands of troublesome hair... but we don't always get everything we want.
cord does not retract majority of the time
I researched a LOT of hair dryers, wanting one that wasn't too noisy and that had BOTH temperature and fan settings-- Found it!! This is the one!! It wasn't as expensive as some that just seemed like more than I needed. It does the job I need it to, in a short amount of time, w/o frying my hair!  It's not the Large size so it fits easily in my suitcase and travels well. I love the matte finish, which keeps it from sliding off the counter-- just feels solid in my hand without being heavy!
Bought for my wife and she loves it.  No complaints
Even, fast drying
Favorite dryer!  Dries hair quickly!
Long story short.. I used it 4 times and it is now dead.Cons: I bought it locally in late January, used it 4 times and now it has died.When i first used it I heard something rolling around inside the unit while I was drying my hair.I tried shaking it out but got nothing.  I was pretty much expecting it to not last long at this point.I began to dry my hair today and again heard the sound, then a loud Clack. The unit quit and had a burning smell.I shook it over the counter and 2 small pieces of red plastic shook out of the front. Nothing wrong on the outside somust have either broke off inside or been left inside by sloppy workers.Pros:  I really wanted this machine to work for me so I will purchase a replacement and give it a second try, since itseemed defective right out of the box (having something rolling around in it.)I love the retractable cord.  It's only about 5 ft long so could have been longer but was adequate.I just hate winding a cord around a machine.. it's messy.. the machine might still be hot etc.Yes of course you have to hold the plug as you retract it or you'll get wacked.It has a nice heft to it and seemed very solid.  Attachments stayed on when in use.It moves a Lot of air thru it - more than the comparabe Remington D 3020 Volume and Shine hair dryer (which I also had on hand).I was just begining to compare the 2 when the Conair bit the dust.This was disappointing after having a hand held unit that worked for 36 years.
Works great, absolutely love it!
It's a great hair dryer! I love it!
Great blow dryers!
I really loved this blow dryer however,  I have only had it for about 5 months and it has just stopped working. I didn't use it everyday either.
Broke after using it for two weeks
If you are purchasing this dryer solely for the cord retraction feature, you will be very disappointed.  Very seldom does the last 10-12 inches retract into the handle.
I used this blow dryer while in Spain.  It worked wonderful!
I loved this blow dryer.. :( but mine just died. I had it for almost 4 years, so it was probably worth the price, but.. i think i'd rather get a new one that lasts longer.
Can dry hair faster than the other of the same voltage I ever used.  A good compact hair dryer!
Excelente
I use this to travel internationally (so far just Denmark and Spain) and it worked fine with the European adapter. Just make sure to flip the little voltage switch before you use it!
muy bueno
/Mounted well.  Looks and works great!
Love this quiet, efficient dryer!!
The plug broke after one month.  Now I have to fiddle with the plug in the outlet to get it to come on, then it keeps turning off.  An electrician checked the electrical circuit, which is OK. It is definitely the plug on the hair dryer.  If I move it around in the outlet, the hair dryer will turn on and off and on...  It was a Christmas present I bought it early December, so now the return policy just ran out (missed it by a few days).Do NOT buy this hair dryer!!!!  Cheap piece of junk.
I love my light weight hair blower !  It is quick and easy and my hair comes out so soft and not frizzy.It has two heat settings. I start out with the high one for a couple of minutes and then switch to the lowand it still dries nicely but does not stress my hair. I have very fine hair and lots of it so it is not easy todry. Oh, and my hair is long. This dryer is keeping my hair so nice people ask me how I make my hairlook like it belongs on a 30 year old. I'm 65. This wonderful blower has a lot to do with it !
This hair dryer is amazing- I just ordered another one for my daughter- She has super thick long hair and doesn't like to dry her hair because it takes too long- We just tested this hair dryer and literally her hair was dry within 10 minutes- Great product!
My old Remington ProAir Ceramic just died and I purchased this as what I had hoped would be a suitable replacement. Not even close. The airflow is too forceful. Even on low this dryer whips my long straight hair into a tangled mess. The nozzle is too narrow so it further concentrates the airflow. The dryer is on the heavy side for it's compact size..The high heat setting gets way too hot. Even low, once it heats up, seems excessive.It's going back.
Product description is wrong. There is no cool shot button.
great so far -- It has great power and heat.
Great travel hair dryer
nice retractable cord
Love this dryer...for the two levels of intensity no matter what heat level.
I liked working fine
Very light and has strong power
Just what I wanted
Night light was too bright and can not be turned off or down
Nice & quiet
it's functional for a 20 dollar item.one complaint though is the burnt smell it gives off; it makes the product seem really flimsy and cheap and uncomfortable
Works great, even with traveling a lot it still isn't too bulky. We'll see how long it lasts but does the trick.
The product is great, exceeded my expectations, thanks! Will purchase brand again
I admit, I was skeptical about whether or not this dryer would really make a difference in how my hair felt but it did!  I have noticed that if I use aHigher speed than is recommended for my hair type, it doesn't make as much of a change but if I follow the proper instructions, my hair is softAnd shiny and the results are incredible!
Long lasting, and serves it purpose!!!!!
Great!
Works great and keeps the vanity uncluttered.
Very powerful.
Excellent.
Excellent. It's very easy to put together, it's not too loud actually I'm watching jeopardy while under the dryer right now! The bell is not too loud when the timer is done. The only annoying thing is you hear the timer ticking but I'm used to that from going to the beauty salon it goes unnoticeable. Delivery was quick and swiftly and customer service was excellent. My hair dried very quick and I didn't even put it on the max heat. I'm African American with shoulder length hair 4c and I never had a perm. I'm glad I purchased this dryer because it is an reasonable price
It shoots sparks fairly often. Kind of scary.
Solid, albeit heavy. Great if you have shorter hair, but I imagine the weight would be kind of a pain if you had more to deal with. My wife loves it, though! It's hard to find a good retractable cord dryer!
Quiet and efficient.Nice wall mount.
I bought this dryer for my 7 year old as her first hair dryer.  It's very small and lightweight so she can easily hold it.  She enjoys being able to dry her own hair.
I love the hair dryer but the comb attachment starting breaking on our first use.
I put these in Rv's because they fit in a tight spot and work well.  Glynnsrv.com
This hair dryer is quiet, powerful and hot. Looks good, easy to handle. Very happy.
Perfect for My 6 yr old daughter. Fits her hands perfect, Mini and Mighty, she uses the low setting, the high setting is very powerful.
Great item.  Would recommend!!!
This is by far my favorite dryer. I love the built in cord retractor, especially for traveling, which we do often. I have so many gadgets I need to bring, my suitcase is always a mess of cords. In addition to that, it dries my hair SO fast. I have fairly thick hair, though it's thinned over the years a bit, and it would take me in upwards of 20 minutes to dry my hair with a standard dryer. Using this dryer with a ceramic brush has my hair dry in under 10 minutes every time. The cool shot option is great for just adding a bit of curl around a brush if you're in a hurry, too! My hair tends to get a bit curly as it dries, so I really like the diffuser attachment as well. It works perfectly to smooth out my hair without it poofing out like crazy. I still like to follow up with my straightener because it makes my hair really shine and glow, but the diffuser makes the job much easier. I've been using tourmaline ceramic dryers for years and I have MUCH less breakage and a huge reduction in split ends since making the switch, so at this price, this dryer/styler is a must have!
Item received in great condition.
Bought for wife.  Must be good, she takes it in all the trips
This is a good hairdryer for travel and okay for every day it's not the best driver I've ever used but it does the trick.
Good price.very pleased
Have had this for almost 3 years now without any problems.. That's impressive for hai dryers and hair straighteners anymore
I wanted to like this blow dryer more because of the reviews on it. But there just aren't enough heat settings on it, and it gets really hot, too hot! But the combs are sturdy, and it's serves it's purpose when I decide to use it. I switch up with my Vidal Sassoon dryer, when I need something with more alternatives to heat settings.
Sadly the product broke the first month of use.  I would not recommend purchasing.
Simple blow dryer with cool function
Doest hold my hair dryer at all no matter how I try to get it in.  Would return but not worth the time or money.  Don't waste your money. Get the handless hairdryer stand they work!
Love this dryer! Well worth the money!!  So glad I finally bought it!! :)
Not for a short nozzle dryer- it pops right off, but it's a good bowl and finger design of medium depth.
Excellent hairdryer. My wife loves it!
Very good quality ! I love it!
The hair dryer does well with my thick hair. good in the hand, the cord is a bit forceful. At times I have to pull it out again to get it to retract fully but this could be attributed to independent factors (angle of handle when activating cord keeper).  Fantastic for saving space.
Daughter loves it...
Lighter than my previous hair dryer.  And it dries faster with softer results.
Best I have ever purchased!!!
I was apprehensive about buying this because it was more expensive then what I usually buy, but it's well worth it. Dries my hair very fast without a lot of high heat. We got this mainly for my husband because he has dreads and this was recommended to dry the dreads out completely and now both of us use it.
Sunbeam is not worth a s***.
Love it
I purchased one of these which quit working after a few months.  Andis replace it under warranty.  The warranty replacement lasted 3 months with use 4 - 5 times per week.  I cannot recommend this product and will avoid Andis products from this point on.
does not turn on - very dissapointed
Have had it for 4 years and still going strong!! :)
Great hair dryer!!!!!
Wife loves it.
Updated Review: 4 months after installing this blowdryer, it died. I was super disappointed given my glowing review below. I have not even contacted Amazon or the manufacturer since it's past the 30 days. The wire below the handle started to heat up a little bit, I smelled smoke. At first thought it was my hair. But, the thing died shortly after. I have another blow dryer. Not sure if I received a lemon or if this is Andis quality. My past blowdryers from other reputable firms would last 7-10 years. 4 months was a HUGE let down  PREVIOUS REVIEW BELOW:  Definite space saver. Quiet. Does the job. I feel the low setting is definitely very low, much lower than my travel blow dryer you can find at any drugstore. However, I like the higher setting. It's nice to wash, blowdry and head out. Makes my mornings much easier to have things in place and organized. This blow dryer comes with two long screws. You have to remove the baby screws on the plate on the back. I then marked the walls where the two holes are. The plastic anchors I did not use, because the frame/holder is super light weight. So is the dryer. It's nice. In addition, the green light makes a nice nightlight in the bathroom. Personally, I wish I could change the color to clear or blue. The photo they provide shows the cord hook is on the right side. There are two other sm/med size screws to hang the cord to either the left or right side. I prefer the right side; however it all depends on where you place it in your bathroom. It's a great product. They thought of almost everything on this dryer. The only two things I would change is to have even a more minimized holder (semi-translucent), optional colored dryers, retractable cord, small dryer, more powerful, cool air option dryer (i.e. fan with a hold button ;-), no cord but a chargeable blow dryer. I think that's about it.
I read some bad reviews on this hair dryer but so far I have not had any problems with it. I actually love it, cute colors and drys well
I hardly ever write reviews, but this thing is fantastic. I was amazed when I blow dryer my hair and it was actually softer. The price may seem steep, but it's definitely worth it. LOVE!
Great
1st of all I love the decent packaging. It comes in a box. My previous dryer was packed in a combination of cardboard and plastic which you open once and thats it. You have to throw the packaging and there is no placd to put the dryer back. But this dryer comes in a box and you can put back in the box.The dryer comes with a control nozzle which helps you to focus on certain areas. I have very thick hair and I used to hate taking shower in the morning and drying afterwards. Because it used to take ne really long time to dry them. Now with Rimini dryer it takes me 10 mins and Im ready to go out. Especially in winter I get sick when I go out with wet hair. Rimini dryer has saved my life, time, and energy. This dryer is great for heavy, thick, long and even short and thin hair. Ut works great and helps you style your hair. Like my older conair dryer it has cold air button too. It has different levels of air pressure. The handle is great to grip on. My older dryer's handle got so greasy after few use. This dryer is awesome.Im 100% satisfied with this dryer. I would highly recommend it. This is the best hair dryer I have ever owned.I received the Rimini dryer in exchange of my honest opinion but it didnt affect my thought.
It works as expected.
This hairdryer works fine, is light to handle and not too loud.  It does, however, have a burst-of-cold-air button which is difficult to use.  It's positioned in such a way that you feel it should be pushed UP instead of IN. This button is rectangular and flat, again making it look and feel like it should be pushed up and not in.  Trying to push this button IN is often somewhat difficult (too thin; too highly set) and takes several tries.  If it weren't for that button, which I seem to use a lot, I'd have given it 5 stars instead of 4.  Other than that, I do like this hairdryer.
So far, so good.  I have found that these hair dryers do not last, so, time will tell.Works good, no complaints.
Works great
Works great, but is a bit louder than I expected.
lasted all of 10 minutes before failing.
Low power, but with patience it does a beautiful job
Good just loudd
Don't know the longevity of this item yet. But it's a must have for travel. On the Euro setting, low is high enough! I have lots of fine, curly medium length hair and it dried in less than 10 minutes. Yes, it's loud but worth it as a space saver and effective dryer!
Bought as gift.....it is just as advertised, does work well & durable for a year now!
My girlfriend loved this dryer...except for the fact that the motor died after a year...super annoyed
Lasted less than 8 months
thought it was smaller!!
Black and pink. I couldn't tell from the pictures it was black and pink so I gave it to my wife. She is happy with it.
Wonderful product!  Purchased due to shoulder injury and now post surgery.  I can blow dry hair while device securely holds blow dryer and can safely move it in any direction.
I love the sleek design, and color of this hair dryer for starters, but I had one I loved more. So, I gave this one to my mom. The ionic technology really plays a role in hair dryers, helping maintain, a healthy, beautiful shine.  No frizz, or elongated drying times here.  Three settings are perfect for drying, the shot of cool hair is wonderful as well. Or you can hold it down to dry your hair with cool hair. Perfect for setting curls.  This hair dryer is quitter than most, but its still a hair dryer, so its going to be noisy.  I really like it, the swivel cord makes it easier, so your not getting tangled in your own cord!  Product received for reviewing purposes.
Super light and easy to handle.  Dries fast and isn't too loud.  A+++++
Great, small, light and does exactly what I need. Who could ask for more?
it is almost impossible to assemble but the dryer itself works well.
Bought this as a present for my wife this Christmas. She has used it many times since and absolutely loves it. She says it has cut her dry time in half!
I initially liked this dryer but it is heavy and all the teeth in my comb broke. Now I cannot find a replacement comb. If anyone knows where I can get one, I would appreciate it
This a very light blow dryer unlike others that I have owned. I love the way that it curves ensuring that the heat is going directly where it needs to go. I have a lot of hair and so does my daughter and its a hassle trying to get it done but I can honestly say that out hair dries in less than ten minutes!! im highly impressed and cant wait to try out more products from this company and let us not forget the color of this dryer!!! Its blue and I love it!! Packaging is lovely as well
Easy installation, and the wife loves it, so in my book that's worth 5 stars.
Great little hair dryer. Very lightweight. Dual voltage for overseas travel. And. A long cord.
Great hair dryer my wife loves it.  She says it's as good as her expensive high end model that it replaced and weighs less.
I got this to replace an ancient hairdryer that just wasn't working well anymore.  This is a wonderful hairdryer!  I can dry my hair quickly and it has all the possible settings that I'll ever need.  I am totally happy with this!
Okay
Great Product!  I broke down and got this dryer to take with me while traveling.  I loved my other Conair hair dryer so decided to find something that could pack in a suitcase.  This hair dryer puts out a ton of heat for such a small product!  I love it.  It is perfect for the traveler as well as someone who appreciates a great product!
I have very thick, very curly hair that typically takes a LONG time to dry. The little mini-hair-driers that you find in most hotels these days just won't do the job for me and none of them have a diffuser or will fit a travel-diffuser attachment (which us curly-girls require). But with this hair-drier, I found the answer!!! It has GREAT air-power, 2 heat settings, and dual voltage so you can take it on overseas trips as well. Barely adds any weight to your luggage (so important these days now that airlines charge a hefty fee for non-carry-on luggage or baggage that exceeds their weight limit) and the handle folds up for compact packing. The diffuser attachment works quite well -- maybe not quite as effective as my full-size diffuser with my full-size drier, but pretty darned good. It's great for travel and will have your tresses looking gorgeous in no time. Highly recommended!
Wife says this is the best drier that she has owned to date. Loves it
Best little Travel Dryer ever.  Very Powerful, very compact. Lasts forever. Does not produce static. I'm on my 3rd one, not because the previous two were faulty, but because I lost one and the other finally wore out. I only wish they made them in more colors. Buy this and you won't regret it.
Absolutely love this hairdryer!  It is compact and convenient but does not sacrifice any power.  I have really thick, wavy hair and this travel dryer is the best I have found.  I now have multiple!
Love the dryer because it is small -- wish the price were not quite so high.
a
Not sure what features might be missing to make this hair dryer sell at such a low price. It does everything I need it to, plus has two attachments I've never used (pinpointer and curler?) The 'cool' button actually gets cool pretty quick and feels a little cooler than the ambient temp. Doesn't have a 'medium' setting but I don't think that's worth 20 bucks. If you don't like the color blue, well you're outta luck. Guess since it isn't foldable, it may not be good for travel. Whatever, it blow dries my hair at home when I need it to and does a good job at that. Will update review if it spontaneously melts or explodes.    BTW, review is based on the price I paid for it. The price seems to fluctuate a lot so wait until a seller offers it for 10 dollars or less. Otherwise, it's pretty much the same deal as any other blow dryer.
My wife has had this for almost 2 years and she likes it, still works just fine
Perfection! Just the right heat and no more overly dried out hair! Thank you!
Love this dryer. It's light and dries myHair super fast.
Love it. Heats up good. Fast delivery. Easy set up!
Works great ! it's strong and small enough for travelling
Love this dryer.I have very curly hair and this dryer is light and dried my hair faster than most dryers.I am very picky and I highly recommend this dryer.
Great so far. Very lightweight. Not hard to use, simple basic dryer,
This was my second one to own. It lasted for years. I hope this one will be the same. I recommend this hair dryer. Thanks Amazon. 
Not as powerful as I would have hoped but it's not bad for a cheap guy.
Super light. I have a problem on my wrist And usually have a hard time drying/styling my hair. This blow dryer made my hair work so much easier And painless. The power is great too! I would reccomend it to anyone!
This hair dryer is small but its engine is powerful!!! I take it to gym, travel and daily hair routine.
Mini and cute even not exactly the same color, still beautiful
Love it !
Take's forever to dry my hair. Which is median length. But I like, that it has a cold setting. And you don't have to hold a button, down. Which I really like. All, and all, for what I paid for it, it's okay.
AWESOME dryer!
good
Rated this five stars because of1) There are 3 temperature features and a bonus cool shot2) There are 2 speeds3) Not heavy & it has a long cord4) The 2 combing and area specific drying pieces5) The great product & low price.This is product is great, and is worth more than the price I payed.
With a houseful of divas we go through hair dryers! Recently we received a tourmaline ionic hair dryer by Rimini and have had mixed opinions on it.I like it but I also have shorter, shoulder length hair that does not require a lot of work. The girls that have longer thick hair thought this product took a little longer to dry their hair but they liked that it had adjustable settings for heat and that it was light weight.According to the packaging, this product is known for being:POWERFUL – Reduce drying time and get ready faster with Rimini’s salon grade powerful 1500 W motor. Advanced ionic technology reduces frizz for smoother, shinier hairPRECISE – The Rimini hair dryer comes with a customized concentration nozzle for precise styling and maximized condensed air flow control to the area you are targetingADJUSTABLE – With three heat levels and two power levels, achieve complete control of your styling and lock in your perfect look with the cool shot buttonLIGHT WEIGHT – Weighting only 1.3 lbs and equipped with an ergonomic handle designed to suit left or right handed usersOverall, we give this a thumbs up on quality and ease of use. The variety of settings allow us to use this for not only drying but also styling smaller areas. The little ones gave it a thumbs up because it doesn’t get too hot on their head when used on the lower heat setting.This product was purchase with a promotional coupon or discount.
Great dryer.... Cut drying time in half! Looks like a professional job!
this is a great product! very efficient and easy to use.
Love this... It has made blow drying so much easier for me.
Wife loves it
Love this.  Light weight and dries my hair very fast.
Love it it's just what I wanted. I prefer this style of hand dryer to others and the attachments are great! No complaints.
the best hair dryer I've ever used!!!! I will highly recommend it to any one! I know this is expensive, but this is absolutely worth the money!!! You have to use it to believe what i said! my hair looks soo good now, my friends notice that and ask me what did i do differently. every body need to have one!!
I was hesitating to purchase such an expensive hair dryer. But it was well worth it. After drying your hair,  it was really shiny and smooth. Hair was static free, no messy at all. Someone mentioned a funny smell, it was gone after the first use. I bought it on Ebay and saved extra $20. Highly recommended it! No regrets. One thing to mention is that nano works well when the air is a little moisture. I use it in bathroom immediately after taking a shower.
This fit into my Conair 1875. It works great!
I've now owned 3 Andis dryers and none has lasted past 2 1/2 years.  This one lasted just about 15 months.  Nice product, poor ROI.
Thought I was the only weirdo that struggled to dry her hair w/in 45mins.Recently found out my best friend is the same & she (like me) was convinced there was no way around it.  Writing this review b/c there's probably more of us out there.  And you 100% aren't stuck.I've got long, thin hair - but a lot of it.  It traps moisture & it's naturally wavy, so it always took me 30-45mins to tame it dry.  Most of the time, a solid 45mins.  Result was hit or miss.  Since I have to wash my hair every other day, breaking point comes when you don't want to wash your hair b/c you don't want to deal with the drying time & tired arms (...and I'm strong).Bought this on a whim during a Gilt Group sale, when my generic (probably Conair) dryer was on the out.Now I dry my hair in 10-15mins.  Usually, a bankable 10mins.  On a bad hair day, 15mins.No, seriously.On top of that pile of awesome, it's very light & evenly weighted.  Buttons are intuitive & don't get accidently knocked on/off while you use it.  Results are always the same.  Doesn't damage my hair w. heat (probably b/c it takes so little time).  And it's small enough that it's an easy travel companion.Don't get scared off by this dryer's price - it's a life saver.  And game changer.  Delay getting this if you want to waste your time.For the Holy Trifecta: this hairdryer, a boar bristle roller brush, & Shu Uemura White Tea Polishing Milk.This dryer & a boar bristle brush easily tames my hair w. little effort & leaves it looking silky smooth.  Every time.  (Note: choose a brush that has both natural boar bristles & taller plastic bristles w. the knob-like, non-scratchy tip - needs a decent amount of boar bristles, but few enough to let air through easily. It doesn't have to be expensive, just needs to fit those parameters.)  For doubled ease, get Shu's White Tea Polishing Milk.  A little goes a long way.  You'll be a happyaddict.  Rub some in your hands & pat it from middle of your hair to the ends, but particularly the ends to give them a little tangle protection.  It helps smooth my hair even faster & it lets my hair better tackle humidity - friends have commented that I look normal when they feel they don't.  PS - The brush & Shu isn't a hack - the dryer is.  The 3 together is trifecta.I was ecstatic to find this - I'd always struggled just to tame my stubborn hair.  Now I actually feel in control of it.  Just bought a replacement for my 3/4yr old original & also bought one for my mom as an xmas present. My friend's now a convert & begging for the name of my dryer.You won't regret.
Don't need a towel anymore in college.
Time has proven this is a good product.  Would buy another one.
I liked this hair dryer well enough until sparks started shooting out where the cord is attached! I only use this dryer 3x a week and it didn't even last 8 MONTHS! That's ridiculous. I loved the length of the cord and that it had attachments. I smelled burning and sparks started shooting from my dryer, I throw it on the floor and quickly unplugged it. When I picked it up, the entire unit was very hot to the touch and the cord had completely severed one of the wires. That was not like that before I started. Is it too much to ask for a safe hair dryer?
BEST COMPACT HAIRDRYER I'VE EVER OWNED.
It's works very good. We had the same one that lasted for 7 years. It is pretty noisy. I thought maybe they had made them to be less noisy now.
It dosent have hot air!
Great hairdryer.  First used it at a hotel and was finally able to locate one online.
K
Smell burning from the dryer
Quite noisy compared to others we have had. Retraction cord has to be jiggled in order to retract.
Works great to dry my daughters natural hair.
Works well and the speed and temperature  adjustments are easy to use.  Well worth the small amount it costs.
It works. Has only two controls, with the off switch located between them. I don't find this very appealing, but I do find it doesn't take very long to dry my hair with this machine. My hair is thick, straight, and shoulder-length.
I love this product, it has a good performance, I really fall in love, is simple to use and practice to mobilize
I have had the opportunity to try quite a few Xtava products and I am overwhelmed by the quality of their items.  I'd never heard of Xtava prior to November and for being a virtual unknown in the heavily competitive beauty market, they really are creating products that will last.  I hope that they are able to get a foothold in this industry and keep on making such great items!The Rimini blow dryer for starters, is a gorgeous hair dryer.  We desperately needed a new hair dryer because ours is ready to die anytime now.  This definitely is a step up from the cheapo dryer we had purchased.It drys our hair so quickly.  Even my daughter who has much thicker and coarse hair than myself it doesn't take much time at all until her hair is completely dry.  There are two speed settings, low and high as well as three heat settings plus the Cold Shot button.  I find that I use the medium heat and the high speed settings the most.I also love that it has a little hook on it so that you can easily hang it on a nail for easy access in your bathroom.  The cord is long enough to be able to style your hair just about anywhere you need it.  It's not like REAL quiet, but it's not as loud as some hairdryers.  It really is one of the best dryer's I've used and it's definitely the best hair dryer that I've ever personally owned!!  I'm so impressed by the quality of Xtava and their products!**  Review Product Received
Sure does blow hot.
Need to be very specific on hanging cord or inside wiring.
excellent product
I'm surprised at all the fantastic reviews. It's fine, it works (so far, we'll see), but there is nothing outstanding or amazing about this dryer. It is not faster than any previous dryer I've used, my hair isn't softer or fancier. I do appreciate the ability to set to cool without holding down the button. So, it is what it is and comes with a fair price. Take it or leave it.
I love this. My mom got it for me for Christmas and it's definitely one of the best Christmas gifts I've ever gotten. Peopel complained that it didn't have a medium setting but I personally didn't see a need for it. I use it for my hot oil treatments and my deep conditioning treatments it works great. It doesn't burn my neck or ears. I would definitely reccomed
the switch to turn on and off is terrible
Quickly dries your hair without frying it~!!!
It's great!!!
Great dryer!  Have had it for quite some time and have not had any issues
Powerful little guy!!  Does the job, neat, compact. Love it!  JJ
muy bueno
I know you get what you pay for but this was ridiculous.  I liked the retractable cord and the folding handle so much that I purchased another one when my first shorted out.  This morning my second one was completely dead.  And I had a soaking wet head and 20 minutes to get ready for work.  It doesn't get much worse.  I'm not rough with it and each lasted less than a year.This thing is simply not reliable.  I shouldn't have tried it twice.Do not recommend.
Works great, cord retracts as expected.
I've been using this for the past 3, almost 4 years and it still works the same way as when I first took it out of the box.
My wife loves it;
Perfect size, dries my hair fast.  I like the built-in nightlight.
I love it very much.I recommend for anyone who is looking for a good hair dryer.  Roseli
I love my wall mounted blow dryer! It puts out a great volume of air which I like and was looking for. It doesn't get too hot.... temp is just right. I like the small amber night light in the bathroom at night. I would purchase this item again in a heart beat !
I gave this to my daughter for Christmas.  She said that she loves it!
Very nice dryer.  It's not as powerful as ones I've had in the past but I have short hair. I don't think it would be powerful enough for long hair. It was my mistake not to realize the power level that was posted in the ad.
My mother loves this lightweight hair dryer.  Says its easy to use.
I really love this hair dryer. I like that it has black with a touch of pink on it. It's made with sturdy material and it isn't to heavy to handle when drying your hair. I only use the cold air since I don't want to damage my hair. It's nice that you can choose between cold air and warm air and each has a high and low setting. It also has two attachments which is perfect, depending on your preference. This a great product to use for your daily hair routine and it's even a good size for travel. It's a perfect gift to give any women in your life. I'm very happy with all the XTAVA products I've gotten to review. They're all high-quality products and I would definitely recommend their products!
I love this hair dryer.
Installed this unit in my RV.  Works great for it's size. Gets very hot on HI.
It still works like the first day i had it, but the retractable cord takes a little finagling to get it all the way back in.  Nonetheless, it's much better than having all these cords all over the place!
Decent product, although, the air volume doesn't seem to be as good as other similar products like this that I have bought.  I do like that there is a place to hang the cord to get it off the counter.  It does do the job, so I am fairly pleased with it.
Love it!
When it was fairly new the hair dryer switch refused to go the the high position.  Unfortunately, since I purchased it as a Christmas gift for a family member long before Christmas, I was not able to return it to Amazon so I had to pay almost the cost of the hair dryer in shipping fees to return it to the manufacturer.  I just received the warranty replacement unit.  The hair dryer performs great, but the switch failure was annoying.
This is the third house we have put these into our master baths.  I even have one installed in our RV!  So handy and so much neater in appearance.
Flimsy, does not dry well, not adjustable, will easily collapse on your head.
The hair dryer seems to be of good quality so far, but the color is deceiving by the picture.  I bought it specifically because it looked purple since that is my granddaughter's favorite color, but when it arrived, it was very pink, which was disappointing.  It should have had a better description in the specs.
Perfect size. Does just what I want!!! No complaints!
The exterior of this hair dryer melted and I can no longer use any of the attachments. Poor quality for the price.
Dried my wife's thick hair in 10 minutes.
Works great and half the cost of the store. Plus free Shipping.
best ever! has lasted a long time!
I Love my Conair Turbo Hair Dryer. It works great and makes my hair look and feel better. I recommend this product to my friends and family.
the multitude of setting combinations allow me to control how my hair dries- its naturally very wavy and gets frizzy fast, but i haven't had any issues like that with this dryer yet.
Connectors always comes off. Overheats. Put on medium setting and it gets the job done. Not 100% what I wanted but it works.
This is actually a really great hair dryer! I love how compact it is (smaller than regular sized dryers), it is almost like a travel type of dryer. I find it very easy to use and that it gives me such the softest appearance with hair. I'm a College Student so I'm always on the go whether its going from class to class to traveling to yoga class/gym I definitely need something as flexible as I am. My hair is on the normal side, not too thick and not too thin. It is also fairly straight. I feel that this hair dryer without the diffuser (black top) creates such a satin feel to the hair and that with the diffuser on my hair gets so shiny! So what I do is do about 2-5 min without the black top diffuser and 3 minutes with it on. The cool thing about this hair dryer is that it comes with 2 diffusers (one wide and one thin), it helps cater to your hair and what you want done to it. Overall this is an excellent hair dryer, everything form the Xtava line so far has been fantastic. I have received this product complimentary for my review but definitely believe that this product is great and affordable!
Works great!  My 12 year old and 9 year old daughters use it and it's easier for them than using a regular hair dryer.
TINY! Not the same size as the usual ones this style so keep that in mind. Other than that, it still works well. It is a bit louder than more pricey hair dryers. Has a distinct rattle sound. I bought this for my mother who doesn't have that much hair. I have a thick mane of it and it works but takes too long. Not the best for styling.
Good product for the price
I like this hair dryer.  I bought it based on reviews.  It is slightly heavier than my old one, but it's well balanced and is smaller, which I like.  As far as the placement of the buttons, I find that my thumb goes right between both buttons so when it's on, I don't move either button during use.  Quite happy with this purchase.
Just what I was looking for....works great!
Love it I use it on all my clients and gets very hot
Very good and efficient quiet too.
had it about 5 months.  very happy with it.  light enought for 3/4th graders to use on longer hair
I'm not sure if I had low expectations going in or what but very pleasantly surprised with the results. Not too loud, fits my head properly and will dry your hair ( obviously you're probably going to sit under there for awhile.. Took me about 2hr30mins ). Money well spent ( especially considering the $$$ spent at the salon).
This hairdryer is great. It is so much better than the cheap 25 dollars hair dryers I used to get from the store. No frizz (and I live in Florida where we have tons of humidity) and it dries my hair in half the time. The cord is not retractable, but that is my only quirk with the dryer. If you are looking to step up and not pay 100 dollars for a hairdryer this one is awesome. I'm truly impressed.
Nice size & low temp is quiet but high is still very loud. Got it b/c comb attachment which stayed on for the most part except for once but I have kinky natural hair, use it to do blow out styles
Felt weaker than my other 1875w hair dryer. That said, it is affordable and compact. If one uses it for travel and not daily use, it is probably fine.
Nice dryer, although heavy. Cord was no longer retractable after only 2 mos. of use. Disappointing to say the least as that was one of the reasons I chose this dryer in particular. Drat!
We love this blow dryer because it does the job under 10 minutes that is a lifesaver for the people in my home. This blow dryer was exceptional value.
Excelent!
I don't remember why I sent this back, but I think it was because it did not fold up closely enough. ML
I honestly do not know where this has been my entire life.  I have very thick and wavy hair, this dryer styles my hair in half the time.  I usually would blow dry my hair, put a frizz control then use the flat iron.  With this my hair is healthier, I don't have to use my flat iron as much and I use very little anti-frizz product now. I would reccomend this to anyone who has thick, wavy, or even curly hair and wants to be able to quickly style their hair. I've tried everything thing I could think of to get my hair to straighten easily and efficently and this is the one.  In 32 years, I've never been more in love with any of my hair tools.
Best investment needed a good blow dryer
Bought this as a Christmas gift for my 9 year old daughter. Works okay but doesn't put out a lot of heat. Works great for her, she has short hair. However I have shoulder length hair and it would take to long for me to try and use. Great value, for younger girls it's sufficient. I would recommend a better blow dryer if you have a lot of hair or don't have a lot of time to spend blowing drying your hair.
lots of power...works great
It works great. Love it!
My daughter loves this hair dryer! It is so cute and works really well!
Lots of power for a little dryer!
While the flat iron is coming apart in less than a year, this hair dryer seems to be a better product so far.
Just used my new hair dryer for the first time and ran, yes--ran, to write this review.  I cannot believe this is my hair!  I have shoulder-length, course, thick, curly hair which I blow dry and iron.  I have always used high-end hair dryers, but this is the best ever.  Worth twice the price!  Not only did my hair dry faster, but it dried frizz-free.  I did not have to flat iron it after blowing it dry.  First time ever not having to flat iron.  My hair looks like it does when I come from the hair dresser.  I can't believe a hair dryer can make this big of a difference, but I can assure you, it does.  Thank you Sedu.  I am a believer.
Great, would highly recommend it
Not hot enough or powerful enough to dry, or style, my fine hair.
The low speed doesn't dry very well.  The high speed is very loud.  It does the job but I wouldn't buy again.
The box to the dryer was open it was missing the coupon that it was supposed to include. It might have been used. It was definitely opened...
Good size
My daughter loved it for Christmas
I love this blow dryer, its small and powerful, exactly what I wanted
Came in quick.. Amazing blow dryer with lots of power and heat!
This hair dryer is amazing, it cuts my hair drying time to half, with smooth shining hair as result. Shipping was from Japan, took about 10 days to arrive in US with registered mail.
It said nothing about ions in description.. One of the questions said not ionic but the box says IONIC. i sent it back as it was not what I wanted for my fine hair..
Best hair dryer ever.  Need I say more?
I bought this for my wife, who has long, brunette curly hair.  She blow dries her hair every morning with a diffuser.  I bought this to replace her current Conair dryer from Target which is on its way out.  Unfortunately, the diffuser with this blow dryer is very small (just under 4 inches in diameter).  She dried her hair once with the unit and said it had to go back due to the small diffuser and that it took too long to dry her hair.As for the positive, she said it was quieter than the Conair unit it was supposed to replace.
I love it, it's not too heavy, not loud, the cored about 4ft, gives good heat, and leaves my hair soft and silky.
Excellent product. ... this a replacement for another turbo that I bought 15 years ago , and I used almost every day of the week... I won't buy any other hair dryer. ...
The Conair Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer is exactly what I was looking.  I had an old one that I loved but I used it so much, I had to get a new one.  One thing I can say is that my old one last a very long time.  I know that I will enjoy my Soft Bonnet Hair Bonnet Dryer for years to come.  I highly recommend this hair dryer to everyone who likes to relax while getting their hair dry.
It dries my hair very quickly and is very light weight.  Great hair dryer!
Bought this for a monthly back-packing trip to South America. It broke after a week.  It should not be allowed to operate on High mode in countries with lower voltage.
nice hair dryer
This is my second--I blew up the first forgetting to convert from US to European currency (it was quite dramatic).  But I rushed to Amazon on my return and bought another one--it really is the best US or intercontinental hair dryer I've ever traveled with.  It gets very hot on high--which is just fine with me.  And it's a noisy sucker.But it weighs very little and is a real trooper--I think I had the first one over five years (and its ultimate failure was mine not the manufacturer's).Read the reviews--most people really really like it.
Super great hair dryer for very little cost.  I own a $200 hair dryer and like this one a lot better.
There is nothing more to say about dryer, except that you get what you pay for. It is quiet and fast, like a ninja. Maybe they should rename it, lol. I bought this for my daughter, but when she's not around, I find myself borrowing it. Hey, I paid for it, don't judge me :)
Love this hair dryer.  Mount it on the wall in the bathroom and it works great!
Odd shaped barrel and pathetic power.  Not worth the price, and it wasn't very expensive.
Works great for price.
Great product
I can't believe how this hair dryer made my hair feel so soft and not frizzy.
Great product
Bought for my wife. Seems to work as advertised. Wife is happy.
works fine
I love this hairdryer!  I've had mine for 3 months and my hair looks so silky and shiny!  My hair is very thick and frizzy/curly (slightly past my shoulders).  I used to have my hair professionally done (roller-set and blown out) every week when I lived close to my favorite hair salon.  When my husband and I moved, I couldn't find a salon that was close enough for weekly appointments, and it was just getting expensive.  I've had other standing hair bonnet dryers, but this is the kind I see most at professional hair salons, and for a reason.  It's fairly quiet (except for the ticking sound from the timer).  It goes up to 75 degrees Celsius, which is about 167 degrees Fahrenheit (very hot), but there is a dial that lets you adjust the temperature all the way down to cool temps.  I usually keep mine at 65 degrees Celsius (about 150 F).  There is another dial where you set the time and it goes up to a full hour, which is what I need.  I don't have to worry about keeping track of time as the dryer turns off automatically with the time you set.  I just roller-set my hair, set the timer, and read or nap until the dryer stops.  I love it!  Caveat: While assembly is easy, it was not so smooth to do.  My husband had to re-order replacement parts because they did not fit together properly the first time.  Still worth it, if you have the space to store it!
Easy mount. Heats well
It was bigger than I expected and heavier than expected but it works better than the diffuser that came with my other dryer.
Works great!  I love that it's big since I have tons of hair.
It's a little bigger than I had imagined but the weight is okay and it works quick. I haven't noticed any change in my hair texture or look but it works well otherwise. And mine didn't come with a diffuser as some reviews mention.
Works as expected, but the Scotch sticky mounts don't hold up against steam...
I love it!!!
I like this hair dryer, but it's just not well suited for a man's use - especially in the gym.  I had purchased it to dry my hair during the winter months.  It is not overly loud and provides a high volume of air - too much to manage the shorter hair most men wear.  It's also much heavier than I expected it to be.  I decided to go with a model with a comb and brush attachment.A word of caution concerning the folding handle on this unit.  The first time I used it I had my forefinger too close to the top of the handle and it pinched the heck out of me.  I still have a sore spot on my finger a week later.  Be careful when opening.
I know some other reviewers have raved about this hair dryer. For me, it's just okay. It gets the job done. I've got fine, thin hair, so most dryers will do that. And it does keep the static down a bit. I find it heavier and more awkward than my previous Sassoon dryer that used to have an ionizer function but does not now. The switches on this dryer are more difficult to work. They're sliders that are only slightly elevated from the underlying plastic layer and have a narrow slightly elevated lip at on end that I suppose is designed to make them easier to move but doesn't do much for me. It works, and I'm keeping it. But I'm not sure I'd buy it again.
I like how small it is and has good power makes it easy to travel with doesn't take up much room
Product arrived quickly and worked as expected in Europe.
Like it.
I good investment.
It's really good and light weight to carry aroundBut the only drawback I feel is the souf which makes my lil one run away
Very adequate.
powerful, folds up and the cord retractor is strong.
So far it works very well, however when I first turned it on it smoked a little, A very tiny amount.  I don't know if that's normal or its going to explode, I will write another review if the worst happens.
I like this dryer, it's light & does what it's suppose to. The only issue I haveis it doesn't get as hot as my last dryer - It's not by any means cold - just a littleless warm that what I would Ideally like. But, it works very well for the price.
Works really well and retractable cord is great for storage.  This dryer is lightweight and I love the different heat settings.  Only negative is cord button is a little hard to push.
Worked for a while. Then, it broke. I bought it a month ago. DO NOT BUY IT!
Works great!
I purchased this to go with my Rusk W8less Professional Hair Dryer and it fits perfectly! I love that the bowl is large and really deep. This is a must-have for curly hair!
BUENO
I haven't owned a blow dryer in over three years. I chopped off all my hair (I had about 1/2 of hair left) to go chemical-free. Now, three years later, my hair is super thick and well past my shoulders again. I'm able to let my hair air-dry, but sometimes even after 24 hours, my hair isn't fully dry. I was excited to get this blow dryer to review on my blog. Sure, air-drying is less time-consuming and I'm able to do other things while my hair dries, but NOW I know what I was missing when I didn't need a hair dryer!If I have my hair styled and I get in the shower, I can guarantee my curled hair will be wet. A wet curl doesn't look good on anybody! With this blow dryer, I can quickly dry my all my hair or just a section because it comes with a concentrated air flow attachment. The buttons are self-explanatory. You have the cool blast button, the degree of heat button, and the force of air button. They are easy to press and easy to remember where they are when the blow dryer is up in the air against my hair.Since this is the first blow dryer I've owned and used since late 2011, I give it two thumbs up. It's a great blow dryer for the price you pay. It feels natural in my hands, and again, this is after not handling one in over three years. (Christmas 2015 will be my 4th year.)
This is definitely a powerful compact dryer.  I took this on a vacation with me, and it fit pretty well in my backpack, where I only traveled with a carry on bag.  There are only two settings, but it gets the job done.  I have used full size blow dryers that don't nearly come close to how powerful of a blast this one provides.  The plastic attachment that comes with it doesn't fit very well, and it easily pops off, but overall this is a great dryer to use for travel or everyday use.
Solid performance right out of the box.
Love it....
So far this hair dryer is amazing.  I love the various settings which allows for less frizz.  It is heavier than my last hair dryer I owned (different brand) but I think it is because it is better constructed.  Drying time does seem a bit faster but hard to tell as my hair is thick.
I hate most blow dryers.  They're either not hot enough or too expensive or they feel like they are blowing a soft spring breeze through my hair.  This one is perfect.  I have naturally wavy hair and blow it straight almost every day.  Either I'm loosing my mind or else this blow dryer really does make my hair feel softer.  Dries fast, too. Highly recommend.
Worked great for a while. Tip of blow dryer broke off in first month, had to crazy glue it back on. Just died about a year later, no heat. It was a great price just wished it lasted longer.
great
Works well, but not as light and small as other travel dryers I have had.
I'm a guy with medium length hair that needs a hair dryer to speed up the process.My last hair dryer was a vidal sassoon similiar to the size of this one and just very basic. Worked great for several years then just quit putting out heat.This one had good reviews and was cheap. So I bought it.Although it worked to dry my hair and was basic and did the job, exactly what I wanted, it smelt like burning plastic. Maybe it's jsut a new hair dryer? Regardless, I am returning it due to another review where someone had a larger issue arrive from this.I plan on purchasing a much more expensive hair dryer to get a better quality product. Wish a company could make a small, powerful hair dryer for $20 that just worked and was durable.
👍👍👍
Very good product, excellent 100% recommended.
Very powerful dryer, worth every penny.
this was a gift to my daughter.  She loves it!
Love this hair dryer. Delivery was on time as stated. Will order again when needed.
This is now the third unit in the last 4 months. #1 bought as a replacement for a 2 year old unit burned up in just a few days. #2 to replace #1 lasted about 2 weeks we are now working on #3 lets see how long it will last. Although I like the convenience of a wall mounted unit if this one burns up I will opt for money back and try another brand.
I really like this hair dryer because I have naturally curly hair and the diffuser works great. The hair dryer temp settings plus I know if it last as long as my last Conair hair dryer 9 years I will be happy. This is the third Conair hair dryer I have bought
Great when it works but tends to overheat and shuts down.
Ver y good I recomendet
Better than expected.  Great product, excellent delivery.
love it! Make my hair so soft and shiny.
Wife likes it but it looks a bit cheap
just as expected
Very good dryer for the price.
Its is just what i wanted. Love it.
Great
My superhero boyfriend bought this for me for Christmas and picked it out ALL BY HIMSELF! I'm having a proud girlfriend moment here. Anyways...I've never had an expensive hair dryer, I've always used a hair dryer that didn't cost me more than 15 bucks and used it until it burst into flames. NEVER AGAIN. This hair dryer is the most amazing thing ever. I have color treated and extremely damaged hair. NEVER has my hair felt so silky smooth after using this product. It's much quieter than my previous beast. The only issue I have is that its heavier than what I was used too, which isn't to say anything negative about the product, more so that I need to go to the gym more often. This is an amazing hair dryer and I absolutely can't get enough of it. I hope this was useful.
Very happy with the hair dryer, its everything I hoped for
Lasts for years. This is my second one and when this one dies, I'll replace it with the same one. Cord keeper is awesome- I'll never go back. Excellent quality blow dryer- hot and dries fast.
Great
great deal! great product for the money!
Got this for my daughter for Christmas. it has great power and dries fast!
really good in use
Great dryer, relatively quite, but heavy.
Wonderful and so very light
You get what you pay for with this item.  It works with no issue,  but has very minimal power.  My hair is average thickness and shoulder length and it takes about ten to fifteen minutes to dry.  It's also not particularly hot.  It does get the job done though which is why I'm giving it three stars.  Spend a few extra bucks and get a better one.
dries fantastically and leaves my hair shiny
Great medium sized dryer. Wont kick the breakers.
I have had 4 of these and love them. This last one started burning up in my hand!!! I got my new one in three days, in time for another shampoo. I love Amazon!!
Mini but works good
Use it daily, works great and I can bring it anywhere with me!
Perfect for travel
She liked this product a lot
After having it only 2 weeks the low blow cycle blew...I'll continue to use until the other blows but I won't buy another.
I wanted to like it, but the first time plugging it in and pressing the switch up, i heard a snap and the switch was no longer workin. Sent it back.Gave it two stars for the benefit of the doubt: Sometimes these things just happen. That, and the item despite being lemon, it felt like decent quality, especially for the price.Might try another one in the future, maybe there was a batch batch.
I feel this is a very good product.  It is a bit heavy and doesn't get very hot.  But overall it does a great job.
love
Wish it had more attachments. Great value though!
Good,but not as powerful as I hoped.  The size is great.
This dryer is excellent for being so small! Terrific air flow & heat settings, not heavy, great quality, and looks high end. It's a bit noisy, but that doesn't matter much. Loving it!!
I had the hair dryer stored away to use when the remodeling was done in my bathroom i would say at least 8 months. I did not even use it 6 times and it just died. I was heart broken. Had i known i would not have stored it away, I would have used it right away. :(
Very nice unit. Heat is good and handles great while using to dry your hair. Not too sure about the shine thing??
A top tier home hair dryer.  It has all the features:  More heat, at 1875 watts  ---  Salon quality motor - up to 40% more air flow and three times the service life  ---  Ceramic pearl technology (Ceramics for even heating, and infused with crushed pearls which transfer to hair)  ---  Ionic generator to bathe hair with positive ions  ---  Concentrator and diffuser blower attachments  ---  Three heat settings, two fan speeds, and a cool shot feature.I don't use hair dryers.  My wife does, and when she broke her old Remington T/Studio, she would have nothing but another T/Studio as a replacement.  By the way, this dryer has a 4 year warranty, so keep your receipt.  (In our case, the dryer was about 2 years old but we no longer had the receipt, and the breakage was due to her dropping it and the fan speed switch physically broke . . . so I appropriated the old dryer, wired the fan speed to permanent high and the old hair dryer now resides in my workbench to serve as my hot air gun when I need one).Not cheap, but a very high end dryer and worth the price for us.  By the way, the Amazon price was by far the best we could find at the time we bought this replacement.
Very nice looking blow dryer and performs great too! It is a replacement for another Conair that I bought about 10 years ago.....I highly recommend it if you are looking for an inexpensive Ionic Blow dryer!
Both of my daughters have/had this dryer and both of the dryers melted in different spots.  The dryers are fairly new and seem to be quite the fire hazard.  Obviously there is something wrong with this device since so many people are having this problem.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DRYER!
Perfect!
I got the wrong one
I bought this in order to smooth out the wrinkles of the 3M Indoor Window Insulator Kit, and it worked perfectly for that purpose, especially at the highest setting and with the concentrator nozzle attachment. It did not get super hot (which was good for the window kit), though I have no idea if that's good or bad from a hair drying perspective. I could have bought a cheaper hair dryer, but I chose this one because it is tourmaline ceramic, ionic, has several attachments, and multiple settings including a cool breeze setting -- all with the idea that after I was done using it on the window kit, I could provide it to female guests. This turned out to be a good idea, since my housemate's younger sister is currently visiting, and she was happy that I had a hair dryer for her to use. I asked for her opinion, and she says, It's great. Pressed for more details, she says, I like that it has a lot of different settings. As it turns out, this is in fact the first hair dryer she has ever used. So I might also recommend reading some of the other reviews... :)
Love it!!
I bought for my wife.My wife choose this one.She said it works very good.She likes it.But little heavy.
BUY THIS PEOPLE. VERY STRONG!
The velvety outer coating on the hairdryer started to peel off after about three weeks. It rubbed off around the handle and nozzle, flinging bits of the paint (or whatever that was) into my hair and on my floor-- one day I tried to just rub all of it off but it just made a bigger mess.The dryer itself was just fine, just that damn clear coating paint looked awful and got all over the place. The only thing I can liken it to is one of those clear facial masks that you can peel off. I ended up having to buy a new hairdryer a month after buying this one.Buy another model.
Can I just say that this is my SECOND hair dryer by Remington? I loved my first one so much that I wore it out! (A one to many drops on the floor after a few years)
The diffuser works well...when it isn't falling off my dryer. I just bought a Conair 276R Infiniti Pro Volume Dryer, and the diffuser starts to pop off the hair dryer once the unit warms up. I wouldn't recommend it for this hair dryer, but it might work well for others.
Nice work
worth it!
works well so far.  temp not as warm as I would have expected compared to other manufacturers' products; and the air velocity not as good even with concentrator - but acceptable. 4 not 5 stars.
Love the product!
Love the power of this!
best ever.  we have owned 2.
Working out well.
It rewinds every time!  Has the usual features, is priced well and except for the purple exotic feature, it blends well in the bathroom.
It works well for me.
works well the only problem is the tip wont stay on
Super!
Product came quickly but not sure I'd buy it again. The attachment falls off very easily.
As with what the other 1* revers state this is not a good device at all. The problem I had with it however was not issues with quality of the overall products but more with the heat element! This thing couldn't heat up and when it got there it could not hold its temperature! I found this astounding considering! I sent this back on got this babyliss  It is of much higher quality!
This blow dryer is generally nice. The only thing that I do not like is that it does not have temp. and speed settings. It only has low temp./low speed, medium temp/medium speed, and high temp./high speed. You cannot change these corresponding temp./speed settings. Other than this I like the wide tooth comb attachment. I have natural hair and this helps me detangle and stretch all of my hair. It works pretty great, came on time. My mom is buying two for herself and my sister. I would recommend this.
Great price, standard shipping, nice product
This was bought for my daughter. Mine is about 7 years old, and this one is just as good as mine.
awesome!!
Some people described this as being very light. I would say it's normal. It doesn't put out a ton of air and it doesn't feel very hot, but it somehow gets my hair dry as fast as my old hair dryer, and that's all I care about.
works great! im pretty picky about everything, but I'd buy this again and again!
This is my first T3 blow dryer and my last.  I purchased this hair dryer last September at the recommendation of my sister.  Paying over $100 for a blow dryer is a lot in my opinion if you are not a stylist.  It has a cool air button which will not turn off now.  I can't get even warm air to blow out of it.  And by the way, my sister's T3 blow dryer stopped working as well.  NOT WORTH THE $$$$.
Wife and daughter love it.  They fight over it. Ha
Does everything a hair dryer should do. Sturdy, nice design, powerful, and totally blows. In a good way.
This could be my own incorrect expectations, but when they say it diffuses it REALLY diffuses. I feel like I'm not getting enough heat in any one place to dry my hair, so I don't use it at all. It's well made and clearly does what it says, but since it's effectively useless to me three stars is the most I can do.
Xtava Blue Professional Hair Dryer is awesome. I have used it several times this week and I am super thrilled with it. The heat can be set to low, medium, or high depending on your preference. I really like that. Because when the weather is hot, I don't always want to feel a hot breeze in my face. I prefer it to be medium or else I start sweating. My former blow dryer only had the hot setting, so this is a great advantage for me. Also this hair dryer is great because it has a cool switch, a button you can press to get a quick shot of cool air occasionally. I love that it has a wind controlling cone that can be added to the dryer for styling! I like to use a round brush to make the ends of my hair curl under sometimes while blow drying......but I don't want my hair blowing every which way lol. So this is just perfect. I really truly love this hair dryer. So happy with it. Works very well. Runs great. Makes my hair look beautiful. Mission accomplished. So glad I got to try this in exchange for a review.
Works well
New favorite dryer for professional use. I am a stylist and having the right dryer makes all the difference. This things blows hard and gets hot. I use it on medium heat and low speed and still cut my drying time in half with gorgeous results. Very little need for curling iron or flat irons when done. Time saver, light weight and I even like the diffuser:
Graduation gift for my niece.  She loved it.  Especially the fact that the cord disappears into it.....
My son loves it, dries quickly and is very strong!
This is a great unit to organize the bathroom. I'm not a fan of stowing the hair dryer away in a cabinet or drawer and taking it out for every use and I'm not a fan of having it sit on the counter all of the time. This is a great compromise. The unit is always ready to use and it doesn't take up space. Also, I am not able to mount this in studs, so I was concerned that the constant off and on might loosen this unit on the wall. There's no problem with that. I even bought an extra one for my kids' bathroom--and you know how kids can be rough. Both units are fine and show no sign of loosening. Lastly, it's easy to install. Love that part. I highly recommend this product.
It is ok
These are nice hair dryers.  I bought one for myself and one for my husband - they're great.  Every time a guest has used mine they comment on how nice it is.  Feels like your at the salon.
Love the lightweight design. Works great
Working perfect!
Awesome.
Ive had this for over 6 months, and the cable retraction is not working as well because the cable is all twisted within the cable (if that makes sense). Still retracts, but nowhere as good as when it was first purchased.
Works well, no problems.
I love this dryer! I like that it has multiple heat and speed settings. It's very light.
Exactly as described and quick delivery.
Worked okay for my application.  I have no hair so I can't speak to the effectiveness of this unit when used for it's intended purpose.  I bought it to dry parts.
