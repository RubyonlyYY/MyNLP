This thing has lots of power --- works so fast, and seems to do so without damaging the hair... I was wavering between this dryer and another that was a bit cheaper. But was glad that I chose this one, as it's the most satisfying hair dryer I've used at home thus far.My only issue with it is that the sliding switches are annoying to use, as they are very stiff. Wish that this awesome product came with easier to maneuver switches.... Maybe next time, in the redesign, it will?
Great! Everything I expected from Conair. MORE than enough heat for my thick curly hair. Love it!
Except not drying at back of head well it is very satisfactory
The brush on this is like a baby's brush it did not brush through my hair. Terrible don't waste your time buying. Price is great but brush isn't
When I plugged in this dryer and used it the first time, I was absolutely amazed with how quickly it dried my hair, how well it straightened my naturally wavy hair, and how much shinier and healthier it made my hair look when I was done too!It took me about 4 minutes to dry my hair with my Xtava hair dryer, which is amazing for me! My hair is super long and super thick and usually takes 7 minutes at the fastest, especially when my hair is still pretty wet because I pretty much just got out of the shower. I was absolutely stunned by the drying time. In fact, it dried my hair faster than my much more expensive dryer I've been using for the last few years.I used it on the highest heat setting and and speed setting. You can dry it slower if you like, but I read somewhere awhile back that it's better to dry on a higher speed and higher temp, and get the heat off your hair as quickly as possible, so thats just how I've always dried my hair. Plus I'm usually in a big hurry so this works best for me.Once dried, I then blasted my hair with the cool setting, which worked really great and really made my hair less frizzy and gave it instant shine and made it look healthier too!While using this dryer the last week, I have also noticed my hair has been much less frizzier too, especially for this time of year! It's so cold and dry here, my hair usually goes POOF! As soon as I walk out the door, but my hair has been surprisingly tame this week, I think in thanks to my new Xtava Blowdryer!I also love that this hair dryer comes with a customized concentration nozzle so I can deliver lots of heat to one specific area. I didn't always dry my hair this way until recently, but I've found it really dries your hair so much faster!This hair dryer is also quite noticeably lightweight! I was surprised when I picked it up when I first opened the package. I love that you can hold it on your hair for several minutes and never get that tired, dead arm, from holding a heavy blowdryer!My only complaint about this dryer is I wish the cord was a little bit longer, but that's just because I move around the bathroom a lot doing stuff while drying my hair because I have ADD in the bathroom and can't sit still just doing my hair! Otherwise, it has perfect reach for standing in front of the mirror and bending over to blast underneath your hair!I'm completely obsessed with this blowdryer, especially since it will only cost you $29 on Amazon, and completely rivals the uber expensive hair dryers on the market! And actually in my opinion, it's better than my super expensive dryer, because it dries my hair in nearly HALF the time! Absolutely amazing!I highly recommend this dryer to everyone. Seriously ladies, stop wasting the big bucks on expensive hair dryers, this Xtava Rimini 1500W Iconic Hair Dryer will get the job done faster, and will leave your hair straighter, and feeling much healthier, and looking much shinier too! I'm completely impressed with this hair dryer and will be using it for many years to come!r get that tired, dead arm, from holding a heavy blowdryer!My only complaint about this dryer is I wish the cord was a little bit longer, but that's just because I move around the bathroom a lot doing stuff while drying my hair because I have ADD in the bathroom and can't sit still just doing my hair!

Love it!!
Dryes hair superfast!
My wife is very satisfied with the gift that was purchased for Christmas.  When she is happy I am happy and that is speaks volumes for the product.
Loved the products and very pleased with the quick delivery.
We have purchased three of these and they do not last. This last purchased lasted 7 months. Will not purchase this item again.
love it.
Like  many other of the commenters, my Conair hair dryer quit working after 3 months.  Good luck with customer service.  They'll look at it but require you to pay freight both ways.  $20 in freight for a $17 blower!  Doesn't sound like a company that is serious about finding problems so that they can improve their future products.
I purchased this hair dryer at my local sally beauty supply, and I absolutely LOVE it! I have very wavy/curly hair, and this dryer got my hair straight in no time! I will never use another hair dryer! Try it out! You won't regret it!
I bought this for my niece for Christmas. I have heard no complaints so far. Shipping was fast.
I just bought this today at Walgreens Drug Store for 24.99, and this was not a sale price. Sorry, Amazon, I think consumers should be advised to check prices. I bought this after reading reviews on Amazon, haven't used it yet, but it looks good, light and easy to hold, and I like the hang up loop . I will update my review after I use the dryer.
Great for traveling overseas. It folds great into luggage. Just remember to switch it to currency when overseas.
Works good
Excellent buy! Dries hair quickly and quietly!
my wife loves it!
Love this little hair dryer! It's small, but definitely powerful enough.
Works great, low price, arrived promptly.  The speed settings were just right, in terms of low speed getting air through my hair without blowing it around too much and high speed giving a good blast.  The high-low temp worked well also.
the bonnet is not big enought for big roller
I would definitely not recommend purchasing this product as it is a safety hazard. I had an issue with the dryer sparking and smoking at the electrical outlet and had to get rid of it. The circuit protector never worked properly to warn of an electrical problem. I see where this has been an issue for others and believe Bespoke should recall the T3 before they get sued for the outbreak of a fire.
Easy to install, just not what i thought. You would need to mount it right that head level, but i didnt like how much less control i had. I'll stick to taping my dryer to my counter.
awesome look, good hairdryer
This hairdryer is very heavy and difficult to hold with one hand. I didn't notice anything special about the way it dries my hair. Other, cheaper hairdryers work just as well or better.
The most light hairdryer I ever had. Good quality.
Cord doesn't retract very well
It doesn't blow as hard as I wanted it to. But will do.
Working very well for more than 2 years
Bought it for my wife because her cheap hairdryer was extremely loud and woke me up.  This one is awesome.  Super quiet and she loves it.  It is quiet enough that we can actually talk while she drys her hair.  That would never have happened with the old dryer.  She says it takes about 5 minutes longer to dry her hair, but that is because she only uses it on medium heat.  High heat is very hot and she is afraid it will hurt her hair.
Excellent dryer, light weight and drys hair quickly. Speed and heat can be varied to suit whoever is using it.The only con is the plug does not fit snuggly in the wall outlet, it's a but lose, but that said it stays in! I would definitely buy it again.
Perfect travel hair dryer for overseas!
Good dryer!!
Good hair dryer--cool, warm and hot settings, plus a cool button.  I liked the sparkly finish.  My only complaint is that it is kind of big and hard to store. Fairly priced.
Cord has unmovable stop on it. Space is limited and I needed the cord to retact into handle completely.
Works 100 times better than the old hair dryer. I'd definitely suggest it.
CONAIR DEFINITELY NEVER LETS ME DOWN...I LIKE IT
like hair dryer ok, my husband found it frustrating to install, strength of air flow needs to be a little harder.
Very powerful and comes with great accessories and a carry bag!
My wife does hair and her old dryer went out. Saw these and bought 2. OMG clients do NOT sit under the dryer long at all. Will be buying another one soon.
Wow.  This thing is great!No, it's not as powerful or capable as a full-sized dryer.  But, what do you expect from something that literally fits in the palm of your hand?  I, myself, expect a lot less than this dryer delivers.Unlike a lot of travel hair dryers, this one locates the fan at the back of the barrel and has some barrel length to it.  This lines the airflow up giving a useful stream of air instead of the every-which-way mess of air that most travel dryers produce.  It's not as directional as a full-sized dryer with a longer barrel, but it's better than most travel dryers.One reviewer reported that the controls are not labeled.  This is not true on the dryer I received.  The Low/Off/High switch and the voltage selector are clearly marked.Several reviewers have complained of it making a very high-pitched motor noise, getting very hot, smelling bad, and then dying.  The unit is shipped set for 125V (USA) power.  While it is true that many modern electronic devices have auto-ranging or universal AC inputs and work properly on any line voltage anywhere, this little hairdryer isn't one of them.  If you plug this dryer into 250V (European) power without manually changing the voltage selector switch to the 250V setting, the dryer will quickly fail exactly as described.  And that will be your fault, misuse, and not cause for a poor review.Mine has worked fine.  It drys my hair almost as fast as my professional dryer at home.  Its size, weight, and performance make this an easy choice for travel.
Kind of weak
Did not expect much from such a cheap blow dryer, but this definitely exceeded my expectations!
the best compact hair dryer I ever own, great for vacation travel.
I love it! Heats up nice it isn't to heavy the only down side is that by the switches I have a little gap and on the other side you can see glue holding it together. Also the item I was sent was clearly a return the box was open and nothing was in a plastic bag. So far so good but I really hope it holds up
I've always been skeptical about new, amazing, breakthrough technology in beauty products.  I certainly believe there are different levels of quality and also that one product may perform better or worse on different people.  So I was hoping this dryer would make a difference, while being prepared for less than spectactular results.  So drum roll please...I personally thought my hair looked silkier, shinier and it did dry noticeably faster, but the shocker was that other people really noticed the difference!My adult daughters to whom I am often apparently invisible, both asked me individually and on seperate occassions if I had just had my hair done, and what had I done differently etc.  Ironically, the evening that I had in fact come straight from the salon (and prior to using this product) warranted no notice.  I've had others compliment my hair as well.  I'm giving more weight to those who see me all the time and tend not to use flattery to judge that there was a very noticable difference.  The other thing worth mentioning is that in my youth my hair was one of my best assests in terms of appearance.  For the past 10 years or so, its become a definite liability.  I joke that it's a fire hazard and I'm not allowed near open flame as it is so dry and so covered in product that its quite flammable.  I put a fair bit of effort into getting it to be healthier and less frizzy and I've actually had people ask me if I've ever tried a really good conditioner or anti-frizz product.  After what I hope is a chilling gaze I let them know I do believe I have tried nearly all conditioners/styling products. So it is a rare thing indeed for me to rave about a hair product or in this case hair dryer and I must give it a rave review!  If you possess beautiful, soft, smooth heathly hair this may not be worth the money,  but if like me you color frequently and have those weird coarse alien hairs springing up randomly then I would say go for it!
Very fast and rightly hot. Makes a bit of noise and heavier than usual. But I still like it, for its looks and quality,
I love this hairdryer.  I really like the retractable handle and the quietness of the dryer.  My old dryer was much louder.
Enjoy the settings for heat and power. Very sturdy. I have dropped it and the rubbery plastic is unscathed. It is a bit heavier than others, but it seems well-made
nice
Perfect, drys my very thick and wavy hair super fast and for the first time ever I don't need a straightener afterwards to smooth it out.  I do wish it came with a diffuser though.
Pretty good Dryer. My only wish is that it blew a bit hotter on the max heat setting. It's very powerful however.
I luv this product.. it's not only attractive but it does what it said. Makes my hair soft & shinny.
It definitely gets hot. Somewhat loud though.
I wanted one that blows hard and I could control the temperature too..this one works and the price was fair.
lots of power in this little dryer
I've had it for 7 months and it's all but dead. Makes funny noises, smells like burning, changes strength. I've kept hairdryers for years and years before this one and have never had this problem. I feel like I'm going to be electrocuted!
Does what it says on the tin! A simple, inexpensive hairdryer. I do wish the High/Off/Low switch were more like a High/Low/Off switch since I accidentally push it too far every time I use it. But it was a minor concern and it's not as if I'll accidentally leave it on. Just a minor inconvenience.
Best dryer ever.I am able to dry my medium length, thin hair in 5 minutes. Not too hot and the cold shot works great for setting your style. I'm on my 2nd one of these in 3 years… I travel with this dryer so it gets beat up, but has outlasted every other dryer I've ever had.
i got this for my mom and she loved it
It only worked for 6 weeks.
Discovered this little gem in a hotel in NYC. Dries hair without leaving frizz or fly-aways. Folding handle makes it convenient for storing and travel.
GREAT hair dryer!!!
Best one I ever had!
I used this dryer only a couple of times. Then when I turned it on it made a strange humming noise, started smoking, and there were flames firing up inside the unit. Yikes! I What a waste of money.
It dries my hair fast and I have thick hair. It's light weight. A great price! My hair feels amazing after.
Purchased as a gift for my roommate. She likes it. It is quiet, not too heavy, & dries quickly. She stated that it was a bit large, but she was previously using a travel size as her everyday dryer.
It's hard to believe a hair dryer could make a big difference but this one absolutely DOES.  I'm sooo thrilled with it!  My kinky/curly fine/thin hair has dried much faster than usual (even though it's the same wattage as my previous dryer) and so smooth, soft, shiny and healthy looking (getting that without a flat iron also means that it gets to stay fluffier looking instead of flat and stringy).  -- I found it cheaper at Walmart, but it says it's a LIMITED EDITION so if you can't get it there, get it here.  But GET IT -- it's great!One thing I have to have on my driers is separate controls for the heat and for the air - this does - and it has the cool shot button as well.  The really nice thing if you use the end attachment that condenses the direction of the air flow, is that this dryer has a round end (not oval) so you can turn the attachment when you need to instead of holding your arm/wrist in awkward positions to blow at a certain angle.  Yes!What this Amazon site does NOT show you is all the info on the side of the box, so I'll take a minute and copy it down here for you.MICRO-CONDITIONERS:  Get smoother, healthier hair.

EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.
perfect for me, i love it
It is sturdy and works as described.
Works great, also love the heat settings and the rubberized finish.
Relatively quite. Wish it had a retractable cord.
its a great hair dryer.
Has no power like my old one.. Would not purchase again.
Use it as a cheap heat gun for installing skins and such on tablets and phones.  Works well enough.
Way to loud, and it takes a long time for your hair to dry.
Girls love it but the lid is a bit fragile
Nice dryer. The setting selection switch on the dryer could be easier to minipulate but other than that, no complaints.
Great dryer!
excellent
My hair still stays frizzy but it does dry a bit faster.
Plenty of both air and heat.
Really hard to turn on the switches. Otherwise it would be a great hair dryer.
Petit, cute, powerful! Better than the one I use usually at home
Works better than the large one I have and is so small
I have had this blow dryer for 6 months. The first five months it worked great then all of a sudden it fell apart. The blow dryer started over heating and then it would shut off then the attachment wouldnt stay on anymore and the comb broke into pieces. I have bought new comb attachment pieces because I dont feel like buying an entire new blow dryer.
I was looking for a wall mount dryer similar to my sunbeam that I have had for years. This one was similar in size and has a few more features.  The cord storage is wonderful as is the extra wattage. The handle is more comfortable than my old one also. Would definitely buy again.
Excellent hair dryer. Love It
The speed and heat settings being separate are nice. The anti-static seems to work, compared with my 8-year-old dryer my hair doesn't frizz up as much.
perfect goods…recommend it.
My previous Remington dryer (which I loved) died after a few years, so it was time for a new one.  The good reviews seemed legit for this one & I have the matching Remington Pearl Straightener, so I went for it.  BACKROUND:  I have long, thick, wavy, blonde hair that I wash & straighten every 3 days or so.  PROS:  I like the looks of this dryer & it dries my hair.  Other than that, this dryer is horrible!  CONS:  It is the heaviest dryer I have ever owned, the buttons are so awkwardly placed that it is difficult to get a good grip w/out changing a setting, & it takes a long time to dry my hair (much longer than my last few dryers).Why did so many people rave about this?  I don't get it.  I would return this if I could, but I already demolished the box.  Booooo!
Too hard to handle
Burning smell had to return it after use
works perfectly as described
This is a great little hairdryer!  Nice for traveling, but I use mine everyday.  It dries my hair very fast, and its so lightweight.
It's nice but kind a heavy when u need to blow dry you hair your hand will hurt
I've wasted my money on several hair dryers that didn't measure up because the bonnets never fit tightly. They wouldn't stay on my head properly, the heat would seep out and took hours to dry my SHORT hair.  Now, with this dryer, these problems are solved!!! It has a nice snug fit with the drawstring attachment, the heat stays in and my hair is dry in no time! I love it. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish the hose was longer. Other than that, it's a great product!
I love this dryer. It dries my hair so much faster than my old dryer. It leaves my hair soft  and shiny.
This is an amazing professional hair dryer!!! I brought this dryer for my sister as a Christmas present 2014 and she was overjoyed!!!
Excellent
The bonnet is very tight on my head. There seems to be no way to adjust. Very disappointed. I will be returning.
Lots of power.
I am a former hair dresser of the 60's and 70's .All hair services were done with roller sets and a time under a hair dryer.So I feel qualified to rate this dryer. IT ROCKS! The heat and air circulation are great. Temperature and timer controls are simple and easy to use. The hood has a clear lift up portion on the hood front that allows easy access to the dryer. Best of all,its quiet. Instructions for assembly are very vague. Just use your common sense and look at the pictures and you'll figure it out. I had mine together and running in about 15 minutes. For the money I don't think you could go wrong. The only thing I would change is the plastic legs. But what isn't plastic these days? Good buy.
Great Hair Dryer
I love how quiet this blow dryer is. It has a comfortable grip on it and does a beautiful job of drying my hair without any frizz.
I'm really satisfied with this purchase, and I totally recommend it
Makes a noise like its broke
Nothing to get excited about. It works well and I like the cool temperature setting.  The cord is much shorter than the hair dryer I had to replace.
I have this for awhile now and it get s the job done after a long while of blow drying. It doesn't get as hot as it supposed to and blows cool air when on hot. The colors are great and it is light weight but if you have thick hair i would recommend spending the extra money to get a better hair dryer.
Unusable .... Bought for Mom to use to dry hair in rollers. The bonnet and closure is so tight and small there is no way to get it on or use it, even with small rollers and a small head!
I liked it, it was a present to my Son-in -Law.  He was happy to receive it, but I don't have any feedback yet.  They are out of state for visit.
Basic hairdryer that folds.  It doesn't seem like it is strong, but dries our long hair fast.  Downside is that our hair gets sucked into it and that isn't fun! Need a better guard on it, but hey for the price I just hope it lasts longer than our last oneUPDATEDon't bother buying this brand.  We bought 2 of them and they both died within a couple weeks of each other.  I wish someone made something that lasted longer than 6 months! I know it wasn't much money, but they shouldn't build them to fail in such a short time!
As advertised!
Adequate, not too loud, but only two temps and two speeds. Since I knew the specs before I purchased, I wasn't surprised, but I did expect the Hot setting to be warmer. The Warm is barely above cool.
It is small, powerful and came with a carrying case so very useful for traveling.  It is dual voltage rated so easy to use in USA or abroad.  I wish it came with plug adopter that are compatible with the pin arrangements in foreign countries.  For example, I travelled to Dubai and India, there they have three round pin plugs.  Without an adopter, you can not plug in this unit directly into the wall receptacle.  That can become a major problem.
Amazing hair dryer! My mom bought me this dryer when I was 12 im 24 now it still works I bought this one for my mom and its the same quality and works amazing, trust me when I say this is the best investment you could possibly make!!!
loved this product
It's hard for me to believe this is an Ionic conditioning hair dryer. It made my hair dry & frizzy. Nowhere on the dryer itself does it say it's an ionic dryer which made me think the listing is incorrect.
Very nice
Very well made, and works great. I have really thick hair and it gets the job done in about 5 min.
This was a good replacement unit for the one my wife wore out.
This is the second one I've purchased.  The first just wore out.  Need to be careful to make sure the tubing is not crunched up, but otherwise have had no problem with it.  Works great.
My favoret
My favorite. Easy handling.
Not big on heat styling my hair anyway but I expected more. It's a subpar blow dryer at best. It'll dry your hair eventually but I also have thick, naturally kiny-curly (4a/b) hair. Maybe if it had a comb attachment to it would have been more useful but just not for me. I can get the blow look with a low heat setting on my flat iron.
Great product!
We were very satisfied with this hair dryer. We put one in our home in Va and two of them we took to Fl and put them in both of our bathrooms there.  I use them often and when guests come they are so handy because they are right there on the wall . We are replacing the one in Va that was put in 6 years ago . That one went right in the plate that was already there.
I was disappointed once we got these together.  Although they are advertised as having adjustable wind speed, they do not.  There is simply nothing where the diagram says the wind speed button should be.  We ordered three of these and they are all this way.  Good looking dryer, but will not purchase again.
works well
First bumped into this product while travelling. Marriott Hotels do a good job of equiping their Hotel Rooms with User-FriendlyAppliances. This dryer is no exception. Its' small, compact, hangs easily net to our bathroom mirror. My wife raves about.Dryers usually burn out besause the user usually forgets to clean the lint screen in the back of the dryer. I have had this dryer for several years, cleaning it occassionally and its still going strong. There are several styles, check the model that best fits yourneeds.
My favorite hair dryer ever!! Why anyone wants one where the cord is all over I don't know.  Works great and is reasonably priced.  Highly recommend!
excellent
Did not stay on.
It does not get hot, but that's better of hair anyway.
Nice product. Delivery on time. Works well. Looks good.
Nice unit
excellent
I am very happy so far with this dryer.  The controls are easy to manipulate, even while drying and styling.  The slight downward tilt is actually genius as it is more ergonomic than regular dryers.  And the company, XTAVA, has reached out to me, expressing their desire that I am happy with their product and to please let them know if I have questions.  I find this very refreshing and impressive.
Love it
Love this dryer. Went on vacation and did not take it. Missed it a lot!!!
Easy to install and handy.
I did a LOT of research for a trip to England/Scotland I was using this for. I had no problems at all with this, it was light and compact, perfect to cram into an already full suitcase. PLEASE NOTE- this hairdryer is necessary to have dual voltage (they use other voltage there) BUT you still need an actual wall converter so it will fit into their plugs!! This only allows you to change the voltage so that the normal hair dryer you use in the States won't fry your head or die on you, a wall converter is very cheap (about $8 and can be bought almost anywhere). I used the wall converter for multiple appliances (phone charger, etc.) but you need to check voltage on other appliances as well.
This hair dryer is great..Leaves my hair so shiny after it is dried. Just the right size.
nice to have a timer and to control the heat.  the description didn't say how hot it gets but it says 75 Celsius and it was too hot for my girl friend and she has hair that requires a lot of heat.  Easy to put together took less than 5 minutes after unpacking everything. No fan speed on this model.  Also the description said locking wheels when I bought it and it does not have it.  Girl friend is super happy how her hair comes out with this machine and that was the whole plan.  Also the pole is spring loaded which makes it easier to adjust up but harder-er to adjust down but you don't have to be super strong to do it.  It was easy for me just wanted to mention it because I thought it was a great selling point because if it wasn't spring loaded it would suck adjusting the height.
Good Product. Does the job well.
Good hair dryer.
The switch is placed in the wrong place, because I accidentally shut it off all the time.  On the plus side, it is quieter than the last few dryers I have used.
Very good construction!
Good Product. Like hot and normal button features.
Amazing product, the cool air feature keeps my wife from burning her neck. Best hair dryer she has ever had!!
product of very good quality, 100% satisfied with your purchase recommend this product to all my friends and customers amazon demanded of such items.
used it for travel abroad - served me perfectly
Plenty of heat  and small in stature but does the job
dries hair in minutes!! confinent!!
Great product.  Works better than expected.
I bought this dryer based on other reviews that I read.  It's not heavy and it does a great job.  However, I should have read the product description in more detail--I did not notice it did not have a retractable power cord and it does not have a folding handle for easy storage.  I feel the design of the controls to be a bit flimsy--haven't had this style in the past.  Overall,  it does the job and it wasn't expensive.
BEST BLOW DRYER EVER,NO MORE FRIZZIESITS A MUST HAVE
I love this blow dryer. The price was great I have short hair it blows it dry in no time.
I have been enjoying this blow dryer.
My daughter likes it because it takes up little space in her drawer.  It is light and dries almost as fast a her precious large heavy one.
Great product and quick ship.  Thank you.
Good product.
I love the attachables combs and brush as a Afro American it really straighten your hair
This baby has power!  I have very thick hair......and a lot of it........this cut my blow drying time down significantly!!  It is a little loud but is totally worth it.  The only problem I had was it set off my smoke detector when I was using a round brush with it.
This compact hair dryer is very powerful but too loud.
Excellent Hair dryer - powerful blower with max heat....
This is a newer model of the one that we already had that finally stopped working. We loved the older model and are glad that we were able to replace it with this one. It is just what we wanted.
This is lightweight and quiet and seems to keep my hair smoother.
Much stronger then I expected great for my tween daughter starting to want to do the grown up girl stuff or for me to borrow for a trip
No issues with this hair dryer and its been months. I love it
Works better than any I have used in the past.  Recommended by my beautician.
very nice and functional hair dryer.  Easy to mount and easy to use; powerful without harming hair.
Love how compact this item is.  Nice not to have to dig around under cabinet to find a hairdryer.  It works so well for being such a small dryer.  Highly recommend this item
Very powerful fan, it seems my hair tangles more easily because it blows so hard but on the other hand my hair dries faster. Otherwise a good blow dryer.
Great!
This is a good quality lower priced hairdryer. If you want better than your average conair at Target, this is it. Definitely a step up. However, I have since moved up to the Babyliss dryers in the $50-$60 range, and have to say...huge difference and I will never go back! They are amazing. But if you are limited by this price, it is a great dryer.
I received this as a gift because I travel weekly.  Let me just say that this is the most amazing small hair dryer that I have ever used.  I have very long and thick hair-almost to my waist-and I have never had a small blower dryer that could handle the length of time that it takes to dry my hair until now. This one not only does it, it doesn't even get hot to the touch! The size is what is so impressive as well! It truly is an amazing tool! You will not regret this one.  I am considering ordering a spare and I've only had mine a week and one traveling trip!
Died within a couple months. I am so disappointed in the failing quality of Conair products. Do the controls really need to be under our fingers the whole time?
Wifey had one for 8 years, w/o big issues; until it died.She loves it, and as a professional stylist she knows a thing ot two about the topic.I bought her another one for Christmas, so hopefully manufacture haven't change specs dated as previous one.
Good dryer for curly hair
This is an awesome blowdryer - it has cut my getting ready time by at least a third! Definitely recommend
This hair dryer works reasonably well, but I beg to differ with a couple of the comments made by other reviewers of this model. First, this is NOT a particularly quiet hair dryer. Having been used to really quiet dryers in Europe, where the EU sets noise standards on such appliances, I have constantly been frustrated by the obnoxious noise levels of hair dryers here in the U.S. So, as American blow dryers go, this one is pretty good, especially on the SET setting, but it's certainly NOT exceptionally quiet. Nor is it lighter in weight than the dryer I currently have. So buy it for the functionality, but not for the sound level or the weight. However, one big advantage is that this dryer has a normal size plug, rather than the ginormous ones with the pop-out breaker that are common on other products sold in the U.S. Our bathroom outlets already have the pop-out breakers so we don't need them on appliances used in the bathroom, so not having to accommodate the giant plug is a big plus.
This Review is for the MEN ONLY. So I, the husband, bought this for my wife because she wanted something more powerful than 1850 watts. So this was her Christmas Gift. Her old hair dryer took 20 minutes to dry her hair and made it really frizzy (con-air brand). She timed her drying with this BABBPK2000 Xtreme Pink Edition and it took only.....wait for it.........5 minutes and her hair was shiny with no frizz. She HONESTLY WONT SHUT UP ABOUT IT. After she dries her hair she keeps telling me to look at it and see how there isn't any fuzz or frizz or whatever woman's hair gets like. HEY FELLAS, IF YOUR WIFE, GIRLFRIEND OR WHATEVER NEEDS A NEW HAIR DRYER THEN GO WITH THIS ONE. HAPPY WIFE/GIRLFRIEND HAPPY LIFE. Trust me guys She will be happy AND she will be ready faster, 15 minutes faster. So you wont have to yell at her to hurry up and then she gets mad and takes longer. lol.
Powerful, efficient and convenient. Can't ask for more. My wife loves it.
(FYI) only produces an adequate heat on the high setting, medium and low settings only achieve a warm temp. Low price, sturdy, long thick cord, very light, strong fan.
Great little hair dryer! I needed something that was easy to pack for traveling AND had a diffuser. I love this little dryer.
Best blow dryer ever. I spend lots of money on my blow dryers.  One because I have a lot of thick curly hair and I like to straighten it. This works super fast and I am very pleased.
Good product
I bought this hairdryer last year on April 2 from iShopHappy and it's already broken...complete with sparks and a terrible burning smell.  Beware for fakes and Chinese junk...when purchasing hairdryers and in life in general. Caveat Emptor!!!
Very convenient mounted on our bathroom wall next to the mirror over the sink.
Sounds like it will burn out.
Great hair dryer. Durable and easy to use. Cord will not retract all the way after but I have found that in every retractable that I have ever purchased.
best size for soar arms!
hot
Blow drys the hair Smooth and silky
This blow dryer is awesome. First off, the attachment makes it easier to blow dry my curly hair straight. Second, it blow dried my hair quick. I had it for a year or two and then one day it started smoking and caught fire. I was totally in shambles and now I use a s***ty blow drier. RIP cute pink blow drier
Great little dryer. It completes the drying process quickly and doesn't make a lot of noise.  It is light weight and easy to handle.
This dryer works just fine and could have gotten five stars, except for one awful design blunder. The switch to turn off the heat is momentary, and if you don't want heat, you have to keep your finger pressing it in the entire time. What kind of design is that?
My wife said this dryer is like a windstorm in the bathroom. It dried her hair so she is happy, which means I am happy.
This blowdryer is really powerful. I love it. I get my hair dried in half the time. I used to have a portable blowdryer that had half the power. What a difference a good blowdryer makes to a readying process! This thing is saving me time.
This product does not work well at all. My 19 dollar Conair works better than this.  I made contact with T3 on their website, they stated the store that provided this is not an authorized dealer for this product and my serial number is not recognized in their system.
comes with a case and ultra compact.
Got the Elchim a few weeks ago and love it so far! Blows my curly hair out quickly and nice and smoothly. I highly recommend it!
I got this to replace my gold 'n hot one that I'd had for years. The brush attachment is very thin and pretty much useless in my thick hair. The gold n hot brush had way more bristles that were sturdier. Other than that, it hets hot and dries my hair, but not as straight as the gold n hot.
Nice blowdryer for the price!
NOT VERY GOOD
I liked it but ended up returning b/c it was a bit heavy for my arthritic hands.
The needles were not log enough.  I RETURNED IT
I like how the cord goes inside.and the dryer works great. Agreat dryer that I would buy again. This did arrive on time.Thank you.
I have wanted this for Christmas two years in a row and finally someone in my family purchased it, NOW they want one!
I cannot believe how great this hairdryer really is. I searched and searched for months unsure of who to believe. I have fine hair, not the thick curly that drives most shoppers toward a certain brand. This one works great for my fine hair, and a plus is that I have not had static during the drying process like with the cheaper hairdryers. There are two settings for ionic, and I don't know what the other setting is supposed to do, but the other setting does introduce static, so I use one ionic setting at all times. The main characteristic I searched for was the sound volume and pitch. Someone wrote a review that said they could actually hear the doorbell ring while using this hairdryer, and that convinced me to purchase this model. It is actually true - the pitch is not really a pitch, but rather a low sound that will save my eardrums. My husband can actually sleep when I blow dry, where he could not before. As for lasting ability, it is a quality hairdryer, and I have been using this for about 6 months and it looks as though it will hold up for the long haul.
Extremely heavy and noisy.  returned
Easy to put together and works well.
Super nice hair dryer:)
I would not buy this again.  It works well and does its purpose.  My complaints are it is heavy and loud!
Use it every day.
Purchased to replace same dryer we have had in out bathroom for the last 10 years. That should say everything.  The old one lasted 10 years and the fact I purchased the exact same model again tells you how happy I am with it.
good one and does the job
I don't know if I have one on order or not... just ordered another one!  Because of the price.... We'll see!
Works great! As advertised and great price, doubt there's a cheaper better one out there!
Great Prod
If you have hair that takes FOREVER to dry, this is the hair dryer for you.  It not only dries your hair, but leaves it soft and shiny. I have personally gone through about 15 different hair dryers to find the perfect one.  I discovered the Remington Jet Dry Turbo about 10 or 15 years ago (it used to come in bluish/purple). During this time, I've often looked for other models just to see if I could find something better, and there just isn't anything.  Many times, you'll find me using two hair dryers at the same time (which often causes the bathroom circuit to overload). I used stylist models that cost around $150 (Bespoke, Rusk Speed Freak, etc.) to Consumer Reports Best Hair Dryer - which I think the people who are reviewing them don't have lots of hair... because nothing holds a candle to this model.They also have a compact one that I keep in my gym bag.  It's not as good, but will do in a pinch.
We got this one on sale for $11 and it worked just fine from March till December, then it quit, no heat and no fan.It was good when worked but due to short life span - 2 stars at best.
Excellent!
Awesome
I read all of the reviews and decided to go ahead and buy this hairdryer in July 2013. It is a good, quiet hairdryer that I enjoyed for 16 months. However, just like the other reviews suggested, there is, indeed, a problem with this product as it has started to spit sparks as I'm drying my hair which is clearly dangerous. Although 16 months have passed I find it hard to believe the manufacturer wants a dangerous product out in the marketplace. According to the return policy, I am not able to get a refund or a new product so BUYER BEWARE! This product can be dangerous and their policy doesn't seem to address this situation. Amazon, please consider what you might do to help this situation given the product is spitting sparks within inches of your customers' faces. Perhaps you should discontinue selling it...
I always used salon hair dryer, compare to that this is only 4 star
The 1875 dryer is an excellent product. Heats fast with with both High and low speeds.Has a slide high, low, and off switch which I liked.  The low speed is higher than I expected but still a very good product.
Kind of small
My expectations were met
The only problem I have with this product is that the comb are not durable
I was tired of dealing with a large blow dryer on a daily basis, and wanted one that was small enough to fold and pack for a trip.  This blow dryer is powerful and dries my hair in less than five minutes.  Highly recommended!
So cute and small, perfect for traveling but with great power! Easy to use for international travel since it has dual power settings. Love the zebra carrying bag too. Very happy with this purchase!!!
so far so good; works as promised, and arrived on time.
Great hair dryer. Been using it for a few months now and no complaints so far.
This is a great little hair dryer.
Great purchase. I have thick hair. Hair dried well and felt silky too.
Daughter loves it.  Works just as reviews stated.  Well worth the money.
I'm only giving these a 3/5 for now becuase the heating element was broken on arrival.  I thought it was strange that it didn't get hot even on the highest heat setting...... it was still cool enough after several seconds that I could aim it directly at my face comfortably.  On the second try, it got hot for about 5 seconds.... and then went cool again.  Third try - no heat.  I am glad I kept the box so I can send it back for my replacement.    So I am exchanging this for the same design in hopes that the replacement will have a working heating element.  I still rated it as a moderate success because the high and low settings for air, and the three temperature settings are a wonderful design.  It blows really hard, which is what I like.  I also am hoping the diffuser will allow me to maximize the wave in my hair for those days when I don't want to straighten it (or when it's humid outside).  It's ilghtweight and has a nice feel to the grip.  I hope the replacement will up the rating to a full 5 stars!    UPDATE: I received my replacement (what a simple process, too... kudos for easy returns!), and this hairdryer is perfect for me.  Now that the heating element is working, I am able to see that the heat settings are just what I want, cool is cool, medium is my favorite for regular use, and hot is good and hot but not scorching (I might use this on the low blower setting to set a curl when my hair is in velcro rollers).  Very happy!  Love the feel and heft of it, too.
This has the power I like to use to get my hair dry fast. It's also got the low settings for really setting a curl or straightening hair. This has some force to the blow dry.
exelente
Got this for an upcoming trip in Europe and picked this for the dual voltage switch without spending a lot. Testing at home on American voltage and it is super powerful! A bit on the loud side but great for the price. Wonder if it will have the same quick drying on 240v - they usually only work on low setting when you flip the voltage.
This was purchased as a Christmas gift for someone other than myself.  She called when she opened it and loves it.  Perfect size, weight, and heat.
I ordered from Australia so expected a 220-240 volt model. I was sent a 130 volt model which when plugged-in went bang.So cannot review obviously.When I went back to check the voltage it wasn't readily obvious what it was. It took quite a bit of searching to find out I had bought something unusable in Australia.My wife was  looking forward to it so disappointed really.
I love this out of the way blow dryer!  For the price you can't beat it!  It actually looks pretty cute on my wall in my small bathroom.
Splurge just a little and get the Babyliss Pro BAB2000.  The Conair felt cheap.  While the Babyliss feels much better in the hand.  The Babyliss will give a deeper heat as compared to the Conair, not necessarily hotter but a better and even distribution of heat.  I returned the Conair.
Works great.  I have very long and thick hair, it used to take up to an hour to dry my hair with my old dryer.  This is fast and works great.
The best blow dryer I've ever used.  Ever.  I could go on and on about all the great features, how powerful it is, and even how great it looks but the best feature, for me, is the non-slip exterior.  I can't tell you how many times my old blow dryers went crashing to the floor due to their slippery casings, but the texturized exterior on this dryer allows me to get a good grip r - and keep that grip - throughout the entire drying process.  The best!
So far so good.  She's happy with the dryer.
It's like holding a jackhammer !
Purchased 5/2014. Dead as of 12/2014. Perfectly competent (nothing ionically special) while working. We've gotten 4-5 years at the very least out of past blow dryers. You make the decision.
First used one of these in a hotel, and loved it.. the retractable cord gets stuck , but still love it
Diffuser could be bigger. But it is ok.
I love it.
I like it. It looks cool attached to my bathroom mirror.  I can round brush my hair much, much easier, leaving my coif full and shiny!
Love it! Works great and is do quiet!
My husband put it together and got to use it twice. So far so good, but you do need to be careful so it won' tip over. It is a really quiet machine and the ticking of the clock is really not that bad. If I did not hear the ticking I would not know if it was on or not. I can have a conversation with the person sitting under it that's how quiet it is and it gets really hot. My husband is thinking of placing more weight on the feet so it would be more stable. For the amount of money I think it is worth it.
I tried to replace my old Conair Dual Voltage Travel Smart hairdryer.  Unfortunately this one was not very much like the old one.  This one is bigger and bulker, weighs quite a bit more, does not come with a carrying case, and does not have a built-in loop with which to hang from a hook. Also, it is supposed to be two speed, but the low speed is too weak and delivers a stream of coolish air.  The high speed is too powerful and delivers an excessively hot stream of air.What a disappointment!!!
I was extremely disappointed in this hair dryer.  The button on it didn't work properly and I was unable to change amps from 250 to 125 when needed.  It was a total waste of money.
Awesome hair dryer.  Definitely professional quality.  It takes less time to dry my hair now.  Also, I love how long the cord is.
Does it's job nicely.  I dropped one star because the dryer I had before did it's job but was smaller, lighter weight, and the hairdryer never got too warm to put away immediately after use.  This one needs to be turned off and left sit for a few minutes.
a
Purchased as a guest bathroom hairdryer. Between the retractable cord and the folding feature, it fits neatly in a drawer.
Love
Great hair dryer for the price.  I battle frizz a lot, and this dryer does a great job controlling frizz while drying my hair.
Works well
Great dryer; better price...good buy!
Received the item quickly. It is just as it was described.
Wife loves it.
3 stars - it's ok. I feel like this hair dryer is a little lacking in both heat and strength, but for the price I can't complain too much. I generally let me hair air dry or only use it for my bangs, so it does the job. If you're a serious blow dryer, go for something else, Personally, I'll go for a different model next time, but in the meantime, I'm fine with it.
There is no way you get a better blow. This one does a flawless job! Very hot!
Nice machine
I love it. Always liked them when we stayed in hotels. Now I have my own.
Received it today...the first thing that i did was blowdry my hair.
As usual I have my wife test out the hair dryers as she is the one with the hair...I think the design is beautiful. She thinks the dryer is ugly. She said it's a high quality dryer, but overall she prefers our John Frieda Full Volume Hair Dryer (which costs something like 75% less than this model).My wife has thin hair which is easily damaged. She sees absolutely not difference with the Nanoe Technology. The ionizing and moisture-rich nanoe particles were dismissed by her as a marketing ploy. I'm not sure about that but will say that at the very least mileage will vary.My wife DOES like the power, and the separate speed and temperature controls.My conclusion? If you have the money and like the design it's a well-built and very functional dryer. If you just want a good reliable dryer you can find good ones for far cheaper.
Loves it and it can blow cool air too. Very easy to use. Thanks again
Wish it had a cooling button!
GREAT HAIR DRYER
I bought this hair dryer about a month ago. I really like it. It dries my hair quickly and without frizz. (I have the ion generator on and use the concentrator.) Also the cord is a good length-about 5 1/2  to 6 ft. long. (The cord on my last hair dryer was way too short.) I would recommend this hair dryer.
Works well.
I already had one of these as my grown children recommended this great hair dryer.  I just bought two more to have in our condo for vacation rentals.  It is so nice to stay in a place that has a decent hair dryer.  This is the one!
excelent
Awesome use everyday!!!
This is best valve for the lowest wattage. I like that it has a cool switch so I don't have to hold down the cool button when I don't need heat to dry off. It looks good and works as you would expect with very simple toggle switches to control your settings.
Terrific, inexpensive hair dryer.  As good as dryers costing 2, 3, 4 even 5 times this one.  Gets hot quickly, stays hot, works well, light weight, easy to maneuver.  better for travel than most dryers designed specifically for travel.  We love it!
The dryer is really good but came with a missing part (diffuser) but as it is not really needed, am not bothered by it. Arrived early and well packaged. Would recommend it. Very easy to use.
Love this hairdryer!  Lightweight, good strong air flow, and a long cord!
We have two of these dryers at home in Michigan and purchased two more for our new condo in Florida.  Small but plenty powerful.
I LOVE this diffuser.
I used this for six months.  I actually liked it during that period of time.  BUT after using it once a day during that time period, it burst into flames and practically exploded while I was using it.  Word to the wise - if your hair dryer starts to smell like garlic DON'T USE IT.  Incredibly dangerous.
OK, so I got this based on the other reviews I saw.  Let me say that I went from a $150 Chi dryer to this.  All in all, it seems to dry my hair in about the same time (I have a lot of hair).  In my opinion, the main difference between inexpensive and expensive dryers is how long they last.  I've had the expensive one for about 3 years or more, no issues.  The good thing about this Revlon (in addition to the price) is that it is much lighter weight.  So, I'll keep using it until it breaks.  One other thing to note, the cool burst button is really easy to accidentally trigger when you're drying your hair. Not a big deal other than it annoys me when I'm trying to dry my hair and the cold air starts flowing and I have to adjust.
Very good dryer.
I bought this for my wife after her old one broke.My wife seemed to think that price and quality were correlated with hair dryers, but after seeing the price of some of the high end hair dryers, I decided to do a bit more research.  I bought this one because it it highly rated and reasonably priced.  I'm happy to say that my wife enjoys it and noticed no difference from her previous device which was probably over $100.
Never thought the blow dryer made a big difference....always thought it was the styling products...guess again,this will be the only blow dryer i will ever use or buy again.... awesome for curly hair.
My wife just loves it heat, power and abilities.  She saw it on board a cruise ship and simply loved it and purchased it right after we got back home.
Heavy, my expectation was much too high. The $ cost was high too.
great hair dryer,  love the controls on this.
Exactly what I wanted at a very good price
works
I bought this item from 2012 and it is still going strong. It is well worth the money. The only downside to it is that just before the timer goes off, you gotta get up from underneath it because it has a loud sound when the time runs out.
I am so glad I got this little hair dryer. I have thick, wavy hair and I need a powerful hair dryer to dry it. This is very powerful, more so than my at home hair dryer. I love the retractable cord. Easy for traveling. I weighed it on my kitchen scale and it weighs just slightly over 1 1/4 pounds. I thought it would weigh more. A good purchase.
Works great, heat settings are good, but it is very heavy and it's so long.  I had to stretch my arm way out so the heat wasn't too close to my hair.  Definitely not for travel since it is so big.  But it did dry my hair.
This hair dryer works extremely well and is easy to handle.  The price is very reasobable.
I have been using this Remington hair dryer for several years now. I think the one I am currently using is my 3rd, and this recent purchase is my backup for when the current one runs its course.  I am particular in wanting a hair dryer with oomph. I like hairdryers with big bursts of hair - basically that are loud and fast.  I grow impatient with many other models.  This one fits the bill just right.  I also like the look and feel.
For the international traveler, this is a must.  Works there and at home as well.
This hair dryer is defective and dangerous. The hair dryer did not work on the low setting, the fan did not spin. I turned it on for only 30 seconds and it quickly overheated and turned bright orange inside and could potentially have caught on fire. The construction of this hair dryer is very cheap and even if the one I received was just a defect, I don't think it would last very long if it did work at all.
Great price and coality! Thank you Amazon!
Love it
But I forgot to change the voltage switch.  So sad.
Hair dryer was fair, attachment falls off when drying.
This is a great hair dryer but it pulled so much amps that i can't you use it oin my bathroom off of my 15amp GFI outlet
I love this hair dryer! My hair is soft and shine and the high heat is not so hot that it damages my fine hair. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star is because the cord is really short.
Small but powerful.  Easy install and arrived on time.
This baby is powerful. Several folks have complimented me on getting my hair fixed, but I did it myself with this dryer recommended by my hair stylist. The only drawback for me is it heavy, but I am getting used to it. Unless it breaks soon, it's worth the money. My hair dried before getting the frizzies.
I've had this dryer for a little less than a year and a half and it just burnt out and stopped working a week ago.  I was drying my hair and heard the dryer suddenly get quieter. Then I smelled burning... And it just died. I'm a little disappointed with this as I had an older model that thankfully, I kept as a spare for travel. The older model of this dryer is still working 10 years later, sans a missing temp button that fell off just before I purchased this newer one.
This professional hair dryer came packaged beautifully making it perfect for giving as a gift for anyone who loves to do their hair. I'm obsessed with any hair product so I was so excited to get this product in the mail. I couldn't wait to try it out! It is such a beautiful shade of blue. This hair dryer is 1500 watts which means it can dry your hair super quick. I have very thick and long hair. My hair comes down to my lower back. I was able to blow dry my hair with this dryer in about 15 minutes. That's a pretty good time for my hair. It typically takes 20 to 25 minutes to blow dry my hair. I like that this dryer has the cool shot button. I always use this button when I'm done to give my hair a cool down and to lock in my hairstyle. The dryer also comes with a button for 3 speeds and 3 heat settings. Another feature that comes in handy is the concentrator nozzle. Occasionally I like to blow out my hair and this attachment is a must to be able to achieve this style. Overall, I'm really pleased with this hair dryer and would recommend this hair dryer to any of my friends or family.
Excellent purchase. If your hairs are wet and messy, the dryer makes them quick and easy to manage.
I love the heat - It's more warm than hot like most blow dryers. I feel like it's better for my hair. Very light compared to my former blow dryer.
I love this dryer.  It heats like a professional dryer.  The only con is that the wheels don't roll that well and you have to hold the bonnet when moving it to prevent it from toping over.
Great
This is a decent hairdryer, but a bit cumbersome to use - it's larger than I thought it would be. Like really large. I recently purchased hot-boxed hair extensions, and bought this to make my life a bit easier (as I can't blow-dry upside-down), after a recommendation by my hair stylist. It works super well at the top of my hair (it looks amazing), but it's very difficult to maneuver around the head, especially the back, due to the weight, the size, and the brush. Make sure you give yourself enough time to dry your hair, as it will take a while trying to use this.
Stopped working and almost burned my hair from sparking at the base of the cord. AFTER ONLY 4 MONTHS!
Previously had an OSTER, but the last two I have had didn't last very long.Trying the Conair, still getting used to the way it hangs. (Sideways)
Best hair dryer I've ever owned and anyone who has come over and used it has remarked on how great the air stream is and how fast it dries.
I bought this for my 90 year old mother, she says its a great hair dryer, loves that it has 3 settings (low, med. high), and that the handle folds, and has retractable cord, also not loud.
It's doing wonders to my girlfriend's hair. She loves it
Pleased with everything!
Heavier and Bulkier than my previous blow dryer. Not impressed.
Great hairdryer .the only thing is doesn't have a dual voltage so if you wanna use it out of states you will need to buy a voltage transformator.
great!
I wish I would have read the reviews on this dryer before buying it. I've only used it 4 times. The dryer stopped working after having it on my head for about 5 minutes. I can't believe it actually stopping working in the middle of me drying my hair. This is so unfortunate. Buyer beware!!!!
I bought this for using at home on family and friends and it works just great! Great dryer for the cheap price!
This hair dryer has a lot of power and dries my hair very quickly when I use the concentrator. Very quiet compared to my older blow dryer also.
great
Good blow dryer
My 12 year old loves this. It is perfect for her
It's very hard to use the diffuser because the dryer itself is so heavy.
It's great.
It's an average blow dryer I use it every day and haven't had any issues, if you're looking for a simple everyday blow dryer this will do the trick.
I love it. It was exactly what I wanted.
Very convenient hair dryer
Gentle on my hair. Quicker to dry my extraordinarily thick hair!  Compact and convenient.  I have 3 grown daughters who upon visiting have asked where I got it.  Guess what? Three more happy customers!  All three have varied thickness of hair too.  One is extremely think, one average thickness, one very thick and mine as stated extraordinarily thick. Love this hairdryer!
LOVE IT. Works well. I don't think I'd have paid the original price. Glad I got a deep discount. I does dry my hair faster and it honestly does seem smoother.
there is Spark fire come from inside I think this is defective one
Love this hairdryer!  I'd buy it again - great value - it's heavy and seems like a more expensive hairdryer, works great!
Awesome dryer, made my fine hair dry in half the time, also gave it more volume.  Great purchase.
Great product
great
Great
I bought this for my daughter for Christmas..... she absolutely loves it!!!  An excellent dryer for alot less money than other top dollar dryers.  Dries fast, and much quieter than other dryers.
returned it
It's a really good product to the price so cheap!
Amazing!!!!  I have never had a blow dryer so powerful that has so many settings.  I like that you can have the same blow power with the cool setting without holding down a button.  Love it!  Great price for great quality!!
It's a fine, but loud hairdryer. You can find a ceramic one in Kmart for a lower price.
The BEST!!!!!
Purchased this years ago and I am still using it till this day!
ALL OF MY CUSTOMERS ARE HAPPY
Works great, really handy and portable.  Arrived quickly.  Great product!
Works great! I use it every day for a year and have had no problems with it. It looks nice too! There are sparkles in the black section of the blow dryer which is always fun :) There is also a vent in the back that opens to clean out the dust or hair that gets sucked in. For the money it's definitely worth it.
I've had this hair dryer for about three months and am overall really pleased. My previous hair dryer was about five years old and kicked the bucket. This one is much better than that one, though like I said, it was a little older. It dries my hair in about half the time and I use both of the diffusers that came with if often.My reason for giving four starts over five is that the placement of the buttons for speed and heat are RIGHT where I want to put my hand while using it. They are pretty big, so if I keep my hands there I often hit them. Readusting my hand solves this problem but since it makes it a slightly less comfortable experience, I think four stars is appropriate.I have not (yet) had the issue of the outside wearing off, mine still looks new.
What more can you say about a hairdryer? It's hot when you set it on 'High', and cools quickly when you hold the blue button. It always turns on when you need it to. That's about all I need for a hair dryer, and this does it.
It's hot but not burn your hair hot, and powerful.  It's definitely worth buying
I agree with all the criticisms of this dryer plus one more. Adjustable? Huh? You can adjust your height under it but no instructions and no intuitive way to adjust the hight of the dryer. I have the more expensive Conair model as well and made the mistake of buying this one to keep at my kids' house for when I visit.
My first Yellow Bird lasted over 7 years and plenty of use by myself and friends. The best dryer ever. This new one works just as well, though I don't think I'll loan this one out so it might last longer.
Good quality and right price.
Nice and powerful, strong wall anchoring
STOPPED WORKING AFTER ONLY 7 MONTHS :(
The motor blew out after a year and a half
I returned mine. I got it to take with me to the gym to dry my hair after a sweaty workout and it was not powerful enough for my thick hair. I get it, its a travel size so it wont be as powerful as the regular one but still, it was useless for me.
So far, a very nice dryer for the price.
I've bought this hair dryer for international travel.  It is very small, cute and light as shown in the picture.  However, it has one big problem which is that it overheats and completely stops working after a few minutes which makes it useless.... I guess it overheats but I can only partially dry my hair which is not why I bought it.
Love it!
Cord is TOO stiff.  I would have expected the cord to be supple.  Alas, the cord behaves as if it's frozen even at a temperature of 84 degrees F.
Very noisy!!! Not comfortable to sit under. Was trying to replace one the was 30 to 40 years old. We all know they dont make things like they use to.
My mother uses ever day
If I could give this product a negative I would.  Bought my first one with a gift card and loved at it at first, it great power and heat.  It lasted about 6 months before it started cutting out. I contacted the seller, but I was beyond what they would cover.  Then I contacted the distributor who said no problem, send back the defective product and we will replace it.  Neat, sent it back at my cost :(.  Receive the replacement pretty quickly, yay!  Sadly about 6 months later I had the same issue with the new one cutting out, no power.  Not sure it is worth contacting the distributor again so I can pay to send it back for a new replacement that might last another 6 month. DONE.
I bought this hooded dryer because I do roller sets & deep conditioning treatments weekly.  At at first, I was really happy with my purchase; the dryer is quiet, and dries my hair quickly.  However, less than 6 months later, the Timer Knob breaks!  I tried super glue, to mend the knob, but that didn't work so this dryer is USELESS now.  I cannot set the time/turn it on, without that knob so I can't use the dryer.  I'm extremely disappointed in the quality item and I basically feel like I threw $100 + in the trash.I can't remember if this dryer came with a warranty, but if I could give the Timer knob replaced I would rate this product higher; for now it's non-functional.
Unlike another Conair I bought from Amazon years ago, this one has a cheap plastic smell that makes you worried that you might be touching something toxic. To add insult to injury, the purple plastic of the iron is not the slick metallic looking plastic from the packaging, but rather a gaudy-looking pageant queen light purple.
great product exactly what I expected
excellent dryer, good quality
Good but can not use in some Asian countries due to the voltage difference.
The bristles on the brush attachment are too soft to pull my hair strongly enough so that it straightens nicely. Also, the drier can't handle the highest strength heat setting.
Just perfect!!
Good price
Love this purchase. The heat is just right, not too hot. It sits easily in the holder. It has two speeds which is nice. It great not to have to dig the hair dryer out of drawer,  it's convenient to have it right on the wall.
I really wanted more speeds as it turns out. Not very powerful. I gave it to my husband who doesn't have much hair.
It was much larger than I expected as it was to be used for travel.
Muy Bien
It is the best. The strength of the wind is amezing. It is light weight. It came at the right time and I would recommend to everyone who wants to buy it.
Perfect size with right amount of power.  I have very short hair and travel often, this is the perfect balance for power and size.
love it！
Its a really great dryer. It smooths my hair as it dries. My hair looks and feels like I just left the salon every time.
I thought this would be easier to use than a conventional hair dryer that blows my hair around a bit too much.  My mother had a similar-looking hair dryer MANY years ago and I thought this would work just as well for quick styling, avoiding the need to blow dry using a brush.  I was wrong.  This is very hard to handle, hard to use to style your hair (well, my hair) and worse, the motor sounds sick.  It makes a kind of lame vroom-vroom sound like it can't quite decide it wants to be running.  I should have known I would not get much quality for this price but I didn't think it would be quite so awful.  I will probably donate it to Goodwill, as I think it might be functional, but it does not do what I wanted.
I love this hair dryer with all of the setting it is great for my hair.so if you are looking for a good hair dryer this would be it.
Love it. Powerful and totally worth the price. Dries my hair in half the time.
For just $7.99 & FREE Shipping (without even buying over $35.00) this is another very best buy, praise the Lord! Sturdy, powerful, and comes with 2 attachments (that I don't need), and the lowest price anywhere online (or anywhere I know of ) for this level of dryer/blower. It has two speeds with low and high heat, and a cool switch, which, like other ones i have tried  still blows some warm air, not the ambient temp.     These run off 120v AC,  which is needed for the heating element, though  I assume that like other ones  inside is a 12v DC blower motor. These likely do not cost much to make, but some can be very expensive. Why pay more?
I was really excited about this hairdryer and it's retractable cord, but it really hasn't lived up to the original excitement. As a hairdryer, it's just okay. It's no better than the one I used before, but it does, of course, serve its purpose. Although the cord does retract, sometimes it doesn't retract all the way. Overall, it's not a bad dryer. I was just hoping for more.
its good
Works great! I recommend it!
this was a replacement for my older Oster wall mount hair dryer. installation was a breeze, even mounted on my old wall bracket.The wife is happy!
Useless
Way too loud and large for travel. Returned it as soon as it arrived.
Could never get the wattage adjusted -- cracked the handle before it was used.
Good, steady product so far.  Only concern is the weight. Bit heavy.
Cap is too small to put over my rollers.
Purchased for my wife, and she loves it.
THE BOMB!!!!!!!!! I have thick hair and at 41 yrs old been looking, for years, for a blow dryer that BLOWS ALOT OF AIR. BINGO, Found it!  LOVE LOVE LOVE this dryer!!!
This hair dryer only lasted a couple of months before it died on me. Pretty disappointed it didn't last very long because it was a great blow dryer when it worked.
Good price
Good product and delivery was performed as expected
broke very quickly
a little big for me. Hard to carry with travel
I purchased this at the local CVS. It's supposed to make your hair soft. It burned my hair and made the ends knotted and frizzy. Someone else on here said that it knotted their hair, too. I'm so surprised at all the positive reviews. The button placements are terribly designed. It's heavy. The air on low is not low. And the low heat is too hot. Now I have to get a trim to get rid of the frizzy ends! Very frustrating.
This is a great portable hair dryer.  My hair is fine and can dry out from some dryers, but this one is really a good product.  I love the combination of ionic and ceramic technology, which I really need for my hair.  I can keep the frizzies out, and my hair dries quickly without drying out.  Blow drying is so much easier.  I am really picky about blow dryers and my hair, so I am not being frivolous here.  This dryer is a keeper! So convenient for travel!
This is a very reliable hair dryer and perfect for me by being wall mounted. Much easier to use when you have hand problems and strength limits.
It works fine till now. the only reason i give only 4 stars because the light that is a bit annoying. there is no option to turn it off when not in need.
Awesome dryer! It's fast and efficient with less noise than my old Conair dryer! Fast shipping was a plus!
Not adjustable. My neck hurts.
This is an excellent hair dryer and really feels like it will last a long time.  Very high quality and well worth the money.  Only gripe is the toggle switches are a tiny bit too short/small for me to hit with one handed operation but thats just me. This is a must buy if you are in the market for a decent hair dryer that isn't too expensive. MM
Does well so far on high speed but has overheated and shut off twice on low speed. Mounting was easy as reviews have stated and it is very strong on high but it probably should be a single speed. The night light is nice to have in the bathroom. Overall I'm happy with it but you may be disappointed if the low speed is important to you.
Purchased another one of these hair dryers as the older one was dying.  So far so good but the life of these things seems to be around 12 months.
Can not enough about. Thought it was all BS about the ionic, tourmaline and ceramic features really having that much of an effect. OMG it is so true. I only tried this blow dryer because I wasn't gonna spend good money on some features that probably are false. Even me going cheap worked. Do not waste your money on more powerful expensive brands. This will get the job done. You should never use above 1800W anyhow. Don't forget to use cool burst all over head after drying as well. MIRACLE worker.My hair usually takes 40 minutes plus With no brushing, which makes it take way longer.My previous dryer had way more W and blew harder.This dryer takes my hair 10-15 minutes (maybe) with brushing it out.My hair is soft and semi sleek.My hair is extra coarse, dry, frizzy and THICK. This dryer made my hair wonderful. I was able to do things to my hair that I never have before because of it. So in love.
Worked great while it lasted - which was less than a year.
i need to exchange it for another hair dryer
Space saver for sure. A bit loud and dryer opening is small.
This dryer works great, and I really like the diffuser attachment.  Great buy for the price.
great price!
Highly recommend!!!I can even repair your hair!!!
Performs as expected. Easy to handle.
Light weight, relatively quiet, good heat control.  This is the best hairdryer I've owned in a long time.
This blow dryer is great. I had a Remington I bought about 6 years ago and it finally died a couple weeks ago. I wanted a replacement that was low energy but just as good at drying. This thing is even better than the last Remington I had. Blows faster, dries quicker, uses less electricity, and is WAY lighter and smaller. Very impressed.
I am very satisfied with the product, arrived in very good time, very well protected .. and in terms of quality, I think is very good ... thank you very much and I hope that more people buy it ... it really is very good.
Yes, I was tricked into leaving a good review so that I would qualify for a replacement if the hair dryer broke within 2 years.  Now that I've had a while to use it, I found out it's JUNK, COUNTERFEIT, BOGUS, FAKE, GARBAGE, etc.  It is definitely not a genuine T3 hair dryer!  I pulled out my original T3 which makes a funny noise now, but it drys my hair in 1/2 the time that this new phony one does.  My daughter also has a authentic T3 and when she came to visit, she used my new one.  She immediately knew something was wrong with it and in fact got really angry because it dryed her hair so slowly she was late going out that night.  Amazon really needs to put a stop to people to obviously sell horrible knock-offs!  These people will eventually give Amazon a bad name and people will refrain from using their site to order things.  Convenience will mean nothing if the products are worthless.  If you have to again buy another hair dryer, you've ended up spending much more than going to a reputable store.
I bought this for my wife as a replacement for an older Conair.  She loves the speed and heat choices.  Very light and easy to use.  Also very easy to clean by removing the intake cover for the motor.  Some attachments included is a plus.
Love it!!!
no comment
I've had this hairdryer for three years now.  It's still running great, and for the price, I think it's a great dryer. I have thick, coarse, wavy hair. During the time I've owned this dryer I've had hairstyles shorter than my ears and hairstyles all the way to my waist. The choices between hot, warm, cold, and high and low flow have made it versatile through all my haircuts. It's one of the fastest dryers I've used, and on high, the air has a strong, fast flow. On hot, it gets truly hot.  (But I've never had to worry about overheating.) The cold shot is cold.  My only dissatisfaction is with the claim that it's an ionic hairdryer. They must have put a tiny amount of ceramic or tourmaline into the unit to claim that it's ionic--it does not affect it's performance.  But other than that I've really appreciated it's reliability.  For the price, it's great.
No power.  Combs and brushes were not right for my hair.  The ends of the combs were sharp and hurt my scalp.Unusable, should have returned it, but I threw away the box.
Used this on a 3 week vacation to Europe. It worked great. no issues.
Great hair dryer with plenty of power, however not recommended if the selling feature for you is the retractable cord as this aspect of the product did not last long...(maybe a dozen times if that).  Otherwise, recommended, great price for a great product (I've had it nearly 3 months at this point and will update if it breaks within a year).
The Conair 1875-Watt Cord Keeper is, well, a keeper. After several years with heavy ceramic hair dryers with winding the cord after use, The Conair is a breath of fresh air. The cord itself is very easy to take out and retract. Making it pretty much usable with any plug in our bathroom vanity. When you turn it on, you notice how quiet it is compared to your past hair dryers. Comes in handy when your spouse may be sleeping in while you get ready in the morning. How well does it work? Longer, thicker hair seems to dry much faster and with it's lightweight use, it is much easier to sustain longer positions when drying thicker hair. The three temperature settings are nice and really easy to get to with one hand. With the retractable cord, ease of use and the lightweight features of this, I can highly recommend it.
love the retractable cord. haven't had a problem with it yet.
Thanks to all
I'm a hairstylist and this is my go to hair dryer in the salon and at home! It's the best!! Well worth the money! My last one lasted over 5 years (and I work 6 days a week)
I don't understand the positive reviews. Maybe I got a melon? This didn't dry my hair any faster or better then my cheap $30 Revlon dryer and I have thin hair. It just made me sick with the plastic fumes it emitted. I returned this immediately.
Not the best dryer I've ever used but, for the price, I can't complain.
Love it!
My daughter is a Cosmetologist and she was very happy to receive this as an early Christmas gift and business investment of course.
This is a GREAT dryer.  I have very long hair, and it used to take about 20 minutes to get it dry.  This dryer gets me out of the bathroom in about half that time.
Used this and seems to do fine. I only wish it had a little more of a powerful blow. May order one for my daughter. Great price and quality.
Bought as a Christmas present....
Love it! Cuts my drying time in half.
It is a little loud, but overall it works great.
I really like this blow dryer!  Doesn't frizz hair!
Bought this for my mom, she loves it!! and arrived very promptly and packaged very well.
The attachments don't stay on too well and the cord is really short.
good product
Excellent product and great seller
I had to replace my old Conair that finally quit on me.  I like that this one has a folding handle and a retractable cord for easy packing if you are traveling.  I have always trusted Conair's products and this one is great.
So convenient on the wall!!! This is my second one, I love it!
Best hair dryer I have found in a while. It is light weight, dries my thick, curly hair quickly, and it does a good job of not causing frizz.
Light and easy to use. Very good product
My wife is happy with the product. Seems to be content. Only issue honestly. Easy to install but the instructions are horrible. Could of been done in 5 minutes but was confused with the pole connection. It's more than just meeting both parts together. Someone can damage the piece easily.
It's not as hot as previous dryers I've owned. It's held up for over a year, so I'm not going to pan it altogether, but I wouldn't recommend or buy it again.
Bought as a travel dryer, but it's so light and powerful that I use it at home every day :)
Dries quickly without drying out my hair. Easy to handle and not heavy.
Bonnet too tight, otherwise, excellent. The bonnet has an adjustable elastic, but it is so tight that there is no way that one would adjust it even further. It hurt my forehead, because it was so tight. What I did was cut the elastic, and then just set the bonnet on my head loosely, and it works perfectly. Nice steady hot and warm options. and high and low. So, had the bonnet not been an issue, I woudl have given this 5 stars. Must have been tiny, tiny heads when they designed it!
Small, powerful and effective. Strong air flow. Sure, the bearings get a little noisy but doesn't affect the performance.
Love hot tools but this one is not turbo. Still very good product, doesn't hurt your hair.
WORKS GREAT!!!
I've always loved soft bonnet Hair dryers, the flexibility and convenience is fantastic. I enjoy being able to sit on my bed, use my smartphone while my hair is drying. It's really great and awesome engineering.
The hair dryer is just what I wanted!!!  Could not believe the improvements made to hair dryers since I purchased the last one 15 or so years ago.
The Oster Dryer came early and was exactly what I had ordered.  I can not live without a wall mounted dryer, because they are so convenient and handy to use.  I have had several of the dryers, but I wish they would last longer than one year.  Perhaps I use mine more than normal.
Pros:  -- Price    Cons:  -- Build quality, way bigger size and noise
Very quick delivery, product is not as good as I expected. Not very powerful, although it does dry hair fast. I figured the watts at 1875 would be as strong as my old conair. Wouldn't purchase again :(
This dryer is compact and worked fine for the first two months. After that the motor started going really slowly and essentially it can only be used on the High setting now, which barely goes as fast as the Low setting used to. Of course, Amazon only allows refunds for the first month. A waste of money, since I like drying my hair on High. It hasn't completely died yet (6 months later), but I'm not optimistic. Also, I took this to Europe, since it's adaptable to both 125 and 250 volts, and it was extremely difficult to change the setting from one to the other. When I turned it on in England, after changing the voltage indicator, it shorted out our US/UK plug adapter and didn't work at all. So I'm not convinced that it actually does change between voltages.UPDATE: 12/18/14: It's dead, Jim. :-(
Exactly what I was looking for!  It folds in half for maximum storage!  Easy to use and I am able to dry my long hair within minutes!
Loved this compact hair dryer.  I keep it in my gym bag.  Nice quality and air blows great, like options.  Best deal for the price.
Update...The hair dryer slowly died after one year of use. Not surprising since it only had two settings: kinda powerful and very powerful. It was good for quickly drying my hair, but would leave my hair frizzy sometimes and was a pain for styling. I mostly used it when traveling. I was also never happy with the plastic wall mount because it cracked and the hair dryer sometimes falls out.
This was a an ok product. Stopped working after about 5 months of use
I bought this for my girlfriend last year for Christmas. A little less than a year later the hair dryer's motor has malfunctioned. I called up the manufacturer, since it has a one year manufacturers warranty, and was told that they would replace it if I paid for the item to be shipped back and paid a $10 warranty replacement fee. I as the consumer should not have to pay for the warranty of a product that failed to even last a year. Other buyers, please be aware of this companies horrible warranty service.
I love the folding handle, retractable cord and compact design. However, mine was a rare anomaly because it overheated and the opening started to contort slightly like it was melting. Had to return, but I will buy another one, because I don't think this was the norm.
I love this blow dryer and it arrived quickly, the item was exactly what I order. I am pleased with this!
This is great blow dryer.  Heat and speed setting are wonderful.  I have past shoulder length hair, set it on half heat, dries within 7 minutes and not frizzy!
It's what I would expect from a 25 dollar hair dryer.  Not many extra, but does the job.
It works well
This dry works very well for drying ladies hair.  It is small but powerful.  Highly recommend for travel use.
Best blow dryer on the market from what I can tell.  The first one of these died on me after 5 years of daily use.  I did not hesitate to buy another one.  My thick hair is lustrous and bouncy.
Love this blow dryer works great!!!!!!
Product just decided to stop working after a few years. Never dropped it and kept it in good condition. I'm guessing maybe the thing overheated?
Great packaging and quick shipping. I love that the settings are not too hot and the low speed is perfectly low, even for a toddler. The high speed will do when she gets older, I'm sure.
Best hair dryer ever.
Good value but crummy dryer. Doesn't get very hot but it isn't too noisy...it was cheap so didn't have super high expectations.
I really wanted to like this (especially when it arrived super fast -- within 24 hours of ordering).  Sadly, the cord was short, and it was difficult to hold and use without accidentally switching the buttons.  It left my hair feeling like straw.  Time to try another!
Love it
First the positive: this hairdryer is just the right weight, not so heavy that your arm gets tired during blow drying and not too light either. The color of the model I got is a sort of shimmering raspberry and is beautiful. The cord keeper feature is also pretty handy and so far, after using this dryer every day for almost a week works well. it gets moderately warm and has a somewhat ok power. I definitely wouldn't call it ultra powerful. I have another hairdryer at home which is a little more powerful. It dries my shoulder length hair, start to finish in around 10 minutes. This conair dryer is not hot enough or powerful enough to do that and has taken almost 20 minutes everyday to dry my hair.This hairdryer is perfectly ok if you have shortish, or fine hair and are not in a rush. I will use it on weekends or evenings, but I don't want to get up 10-15 minutes earlier in the morning to get my hair dried.
great product
Well,  I purchased this item just for weatherizing my windows and it worked for that.
A great hairdryer.
Can't beat the $10 price! I was looking for a new hair dryer, and this was one of the 3 choices I had. The other one was also Remington ($30), and the third was from another brand for around $60. I'm not a fan of yellow color, so this was one thing keeping me from getting this hair dryer (when I was looking at it, it cost around $20). However, next day the price went to $10, and I didn't have to think much as the specifications were exactly as what I was looking for. After trying the hair dryer, I can only say the best things - it works perfectly!
First one shot out sparks and died after about two years of usage, not a bad run but a frightening end.. I loved the size so had purchased a second back up soon after buying the original. Put the backup in service about six months ago and the blower on that one started sounding odd recently, Today it made a loud noise and a piece fell off inside. I'm about to shop for another brand..
Bought this for my little girl (8yr old) to be able to dry hair on her own. It is the perfect weight, it is cute, it perfectly in her little hands, she loves it. It doesn't have a guard like my Conair does to keep the hair from being sucked in the back of it (most women know what I mean) but it is well worth the price esp will all the other attachments included.
convient
Works well..no issues.
Purchased to take to Mexico and it is quite powerful for a TINY dryer!  Doesn't take up much suitcase space.
Do NOT buy this hair dryer!  I purchased one just over a year ago, and the heating element died after 6 months (and I don't even use it daily).  Not being a fast learner, I bough the same dryer, and guess what?  6 months later, the heating element died.Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  I will not be purchasing another Revlon dyer again.
This is a nice hair dryer, but as hard as I've tried to figure out why it's a $130 hair dryer, I just can't find the value.I have pretty short hair and don't use a dryer that often, so I admit that I'm not the target market. But my wife has very thick long hair and uses a blow dryer every time she washes her hair. I've kept a close eye on her hair since she started using this dryer and I can't detect any difference either. So I asked her directly, would you pay $130 for this? No, she wouldn't. She said that it's not much different than her $40 dryer.I like the fact that there are two independent controls: temp and air speed. That's nice. I also like the fact that you can override the heat and blast cold air on demand. That's a great touch.But as far as the moisturizing and conditioning aspects, I can't detect them at all. I'm not typically such a skeptic, but when a product costs substantially more than the everyday version that I've been using for years, I need to somehow be convinced and wowed that the product is really worth paying so much more. Unfortunately, I wasn't wowed by this dryer.
Although I'm wary that the dryer may go out in the next 8-10 months or start to develop a strange scent (per previous reviews here and on other sites), I am for the most part happy with my purchase ESPECIALLY for the price of $20 for a hair dryer that is still being sold in Ulta and other stores for up to $55. The dryer does have side buttons, which for many people was an issue, but the dryer I had prior had the same feature and it doesn't get in my way now as it didn't then. The hair dryer is light/medium weight. The swivel cord hasn't been an issue for me either. This is after 1 use but I believe it is going to work out wonderfully.(Also note: make sure you dry your hair 1-2 inches away from the hair itself or else this or ANY dryer will burn out quicker than it normally would!)
I was definitely skeptical of the claims of this dryer's nanoe technology. But surprisingly, my hair feels smoother and more conditioned than normal (as if I used extra conditioner or just done a treatment). The dryer dries quickly with strong blast without being too noisy. It looks sleek and, despite the size, doesn't feel overly heavy. The weight is well balanced. The cold blast feature works as expected. The issues I had was with the sliding button controls which can be a little stiff. Also, I have straight, moderately thick hair and the 'conditioning' effect sometimes flatten my hair. Hair can feel too soft that there's not enough 'lift' and bounce. This is great when hair is brittle and frizzy. Not so great on humid days. Curly hair may not have this issue. So far, the biggest drawback is definitely the price.
Good for basic hair dying needs. Not for styling so much. But for the price I say two thumbs up
Gets rid of the frizzies.  Perfect!
This hair dryer is okay. Bonnet is comfortable however the air hose is too short so you almost need to hold it on your lap when using it. Also hose and or bonnet do not fit back into side of dryer as it would appear. A bit concerned that I can only use the dryer on low setting because it seems to get too hot.
Searched high and low for a good quality,  stylish and affordable hair dryer. This is perfect....I've had it a while now (over a year) and I am still happy to have found this.  I really love the folding handle and retracting cable with the push of a button - allows me to pack it away nice and easily.  Everything else works as described.
Had no idea this hair dryer had a retractable cord!! I was very excited to see that. Works great, but it makes our apartment fuse blow every time I use it more than 10-15 minutes (might just be our place but we live in a townhome).
I gave my daughter, a hair stylist, this Panasonic hair dryer to try out.  She liked it so much that she took it to work and replaced her other dryer with this one.  She told me that no matter what hair type she worked on, this hair dryer made the client's hair look fuller, and silky.  Maybe it's the nanoe technology that makes the difference.  She also liked the extra long cord (9 ft).  The only negative thing was that it's a little on the heavy side for home use, although professional hair dryers tend to be that way.  Imported from Thailand.
Works great, light weight, easy to handle.  Just what I was looking for..
The wife says to give this dryer 5 stars. She really likes it!
My other Conair 1875 was starting to turn itself off (shorting out?) during use so I hunted Amazon reviews for a good one with Prime shipping. This one came up with the most reviews in this price range. I know I shouldn't but I wash and dry my hair every day. I needed something reliable but under $30.The first thing that bothered me was that I received an obvious return which doesn't bode well. I've tried this for a couple days so the jury's still out but right away here's what I like and don't like about it:PROS-very quiet-lightweight-useful attachments-multiple speed options-cool shot-ability to clean filterCONS-nozzle is longer-matte finish makes it slippery to hold-cool shot button is much shorter than older Conair-easy to accidentally press/hold cool shot when you don't want it-speed/heat button sliders very cheaply made-filter is hinged and doesn't open all the wayFor price and value, okay buy. If you have short arms like I do, the longer barrel makes for an awkward morning ritual. Also, since it's slippery to hold, you have to learn how to hold it differently which can be problem, if like me, you have arthritis issues. With the old Conair, I could lazily hold it however I want. I could rest my thumb below the cool shot button since it protruded at least 1/2 and you really had to push it down to use it. The cool shot on this one is flimsy and depresses quite easily. I'm also worried about the settings buttons. It does not seem very secure and/or there is only a small attachment in the middle. In other words, as you slide them, the top and bottom of the buttons are not attached in any way to the unit. They actually stick out a little bit (are not completely flushed against the handle). Whether this will be a problem should they come off remains to be seen.Overall a mixed bag but it was priced fairly cheap. Will update rating if it does not frizz my hair (anymore than I'm already drying it out by repeated washings).f it does not frizz my hair (anymore than I'm already drying it out by repeated washings).
Perfect
Love this little guy.  Good for short to medium hair, but not for long hair.  Nightlite is nice touch.
I have several of these hair dryers. I keep one as a back-up in case my other one breaks. It works well, puts out good heat and I love the colors.
muy bueno
ordered purple, got red/pink. plus my hair get caught in the intake
Great product, highly recommended.
I first used this hairdryer at a hotel. It is definitely one of the best hairdryers I have ever owned. It is small and compact, and folds nicely. It also has a retractable cord, which is a huge bonus. As far as drying goes, this dryer did a great job on my hair. I have thick, coarse hair that is about shoulder-length. The airflow is excellent, and this dryer shaved at least five minutes off my normal drying time. It is also surprisingly quiet (as quiet as a hairdryer can be), even on the high speed. I highly recommend.
Great product. I would only suggest that the cord be about six inches longer for ease and comfort.
Great product! my Kids like it!
super product!
Great dryer. Never gets too hot.
works great!
I use it quite often..Very good for this price. I hardly used the attachment that came with it..
Works great. Love that it folds. A bit heavy for someone who has to round brush a lot of hair like I do.
Broke within a few weeks from date of purchase. Would not recommend.
Great hair dryer. I like that it has a cool blowing feature because in the summer time I can dry my hair without heat. Works fine for me.The handle is a little big and awkward to hold when I switch it to my left hand but if I hold it up at the top it's okay. The pros outweigh the cons for me!
This is a great hair dryer! I watched the utube video of the woman with naturally curly hair and how she used this particular dryer because I have permed hair and need a diffuser and medium air pressure to dry my hair but still keep the curls. My previous Sassoon hair dryer did a great job of drying as well as maintaining my slowly diminishing old perm curls but with a little scrunching with mousse and my old, non ion ceramic dryer, my curls still looked good.With my purchase of the Remington AC2015  pearl, ionic dryer additions, I looked forward to the same old but better.....My hair is much more shiny and less frizzy, yes, but I do have to work with scrunching/spray to get those curls that I had when drying with my old non-pearl ceramic, etc. hairdryer. I think the ceramic or pearl or ionic features of this dryer are wonderful but, for someone like me with a loose perm of about 10 months, the dryer makes my hair just too smooth.Am certain this model would be perfect for all those ladies with gorgeous, thick hair who want the smooth look at a very very good price.Diffuser is included which did entice me to purchase this hair dryer as I do need to use a diffuser. BTW, reviewers have said dryer could be lighter in weight but it's perfectly OK with me. I felt my old dryer was OK regarding weight and feel this one is, as well. Not noisy at all, despite what some have said. I use it on medium airflow and medium heat and I'm very happy - not loud and I could definitely use the dryer for as long as it took to dry my hair if I had long hair w/o freaking out because of its noise.
Best hair dryer ever. It is very strong and dries your hair right away, it also gives a volume since it is 1600 Watt, the money you pay for it definitely worth it.
My last hair dryer was an Andis and I bought an Andis again because I was so impressed with their quality.  So compact that it fits easily in my suitcase. You feel better when travelling when you know you will be able to look good in all your vacation photos.  Great as an everyday dryer for those with small bathrooms!
Excellent product!  Quick attention very well packed and fast! - It is powerful to my wife loves
EXCELENTE
Dried my long straight fine hair in a reasonable amount of time. Did a faster job than my old dryer. We've been using that one to roast green coffee beans, so I was needing a new one.The different temp settings were accurate and the cool shot button worked fine. Left my hair looking full with a nice shine.It felt well balanced in the hand and was easy to hold and work with. Not too noisy, big plus. No weird plasticky smell on first use. Even bigger plus.The retractable cord is genius!If you are looking for a new hair dryer I think this one is a very good value. Works great with all the features you need.
This is like no other dryer I've ever owned.  My 5 year old dryer caught fire . After a few quick looks around my ruraltown for  any kind of dryer,  (Dryers are dryers. Right?), and coming up empty,  I just went online and with little consideration except price, in 5 minutes I just clicked  the buy button & forgot about it.  When it arrived and I used it , it was a force!  My hair dryed  practically instantly and with added volume.  It has many buttons.  Not sure what all are for.  Can't read them without my glasses.Just pushed them all until I get fastest & hotest.  I can use my round brush & this dryer and dry & style my hair faster than with any of my specialty  hair stylers. Just a few minutes. ( I have shortish hair)  I've got the Instyler $100+  & The Pefecter Fusion Styler $100+  & others.  I can't pinpoint why this one works better in lightening speed.... (  I think it was $20 or $30.)....  but it does.  Do yourself a big favor & look no further.  It's no gamble at all. With Amazon you can return it.
It works great, is a little bit heavy but has good power, it heated very well. I am happy with my purchase
I've had my hair dryer, a Conair mini, for ages--more than 10 years.  The Conair has only two setting (high and low) and did not come with any accessories.  So going from the Conair to the Panasonic Nanoe was like upgrading from a basic to a state-of -the-art hair dryer.The Panasonic Nanoe comes with a quick-dry nozzle, a set nozzle and a diffuser. It boasts 3 temperatures settings--hot, warm and cool, and a choice of strong (high) or gentle (low) airflow.  What makes this hair dryer special is that it produces nanoe or invisible water particles that cling to your hair as you dry it.I have thick hair that reaches to my shoulders and when I used the Panasonic, I had the impression that strands of hair were separated. It boosted my hair's natural volume and gave it more movement. And my hair felt softer too after I used the Panasonic with the quick-dry nozzle and the diffuser.  My sister who has long fine hair also agreed that this dryer seemed to give her hair more volume too.Since I've been handling a mini dryer for years, it took a bit of time to get used to the full-sized Panasonic. At first it felt heavy, especially when I attached the diffuser to it, and therefore was somewhat awkward to manage.  However, I'm getting used to its weight and size and therefore doing a better job at styling my hair with it.  The Panasonic Nanoe does emit a smell, but according to the operating instructions booklet, it is normal and harmless.I'm glad I got this hair dryer. I like having the different temperature settings, especially the cool one because I want to avoid heat damage.  With my old dryer, I didn't have any other choice but hot.  After using an attachment with the hot setting, it may be warm to the touch so handle with care if you need to switch nozzles.  This is a great hair dryer. I don't quite understand the fine details behind the Nanoe technology, but these invisible particles certainly make my hair look good.
luv it.
I have had this for about a year now and I like it. No problems at all. Basic hair dryer, not too loud, not too fancy.
Works great and always at hands reach. Very satisfied with this product.
This is worth it especially the price!
This hair dryer is just alright. I have fine wavy hair, but a lot of it, and needed a hair dryer with a diffuser. After looking through reviews I decided to purchase this one over some cheaper models or buying the same Vidal Sassoon model I've owned for many years.My first impression was that I was shocked by how heavy it was, because it's ceramic. It can be sort of awkward to use before you get used to it. Secondly, the difference between the warm to the hot setting is pretty big. The warm on mine has barely more heat than the cool setting and the hot setting is too hot to use for more than a minute or two. The hot also makes my hair super frizzy, but that's fixed by blasting it on the cool setting after the heat. But I do worry that it damages my hair. I would use the warm setting if it didn't take so long.This hair dryer is kept at my boyfriend's and I only use it to dry the roots of my hair with the diffuser to give them lift, so it doesn't see much use. Because I don't use it often I can get over the negatives of the dryer and it is alright for me. If I had to use it every day or dried more than the roots of my hair I would return it.
This is awesome I really love it;)
Great value for the money. Faster drying without overheating one's hair, when compared to our previous hair dryer.
Love this dryer!! Dries quickly and straightens hair nicely.
great hair dryer
A nice hairdryer.  Strong yet more quiet than the previous folding model.  You can dry your hair in a couple of minutes. Convenient for travel yet more durable looking than the older model that I had for many years.
First used this hair dryer when staying at a motel & had to have it.  I love the retractable cord.
I bought this for my wife because she borrowed one like this while staying with a friend and loved it.  Good power, multiple heat settings, and doesn't have that motor wind that some put out that drive you crazy.  The vent poece on the back is removeable for cleaning out lint that gets trapped in there... this is a great feature and should improve the life expectancy of this hair dryer.
Very low air pressure.
Great hair dryer and the as ones used in the salon I go to.
Very pleased with this purchase. The different heat settings is great.
An excellent dryer, but heavier than most. The retractable cord is a great feature, but adds to the weight.
It's a nice hair dryer, has a cool setting 3 diff temp settings and 2 diff speed settings. I knock off one star because after a month one of the points broke off on the diffuser.
Hoy recibí el paquete en Venezuela, es un regalo para mi esposa. En el momento de usarlo el producto no funcionó. Es muy lamentable para mí encontrarme con esta situación. Por favor solicito que se resuelva mi problema. GraciasToday I received the package in Venezuela, is a gift for my wife. At the time of using the product did not work. It is very unfortunate for me to meet this situation. Please I request that my problem is resolved. Thank you
Gets the job done and it is cheap.
I've had mine for almost all 4 years of college and it still works well.  It's lasted longer than a lot of friends in my life.  I've had no sparks, no overheating, and have not burned off any of my hair.  I use it to dry my hair after I take a shower and I have no complaints.
This would be a great product if the bonnet attached to the hose more securely.
Must have got a dud but ours died!
Love it
good
its PERFECT and so is Amazon .com
It's very powerful and does not burn my hair
Cute little hair dryer. My younger daughter wanted her own dryer so I got this one. she loves it and so does my older daughter. Works great, has alot of power for a little thing  pretty color also
My favorite  blow dryer . Very strong and fast. I can browdry my sister's 4a/b curly hair in 20 -30 min and my type 3 hair in 7-10  min.
I received the item when stated and it is what I had wanted and expected. It was easy for me to install. Thank you.
Everything was very good
it is the good hair dryer！I will continue use it to see if my hair can be better. So far is good！
Yes, please and thank you! I'm so happy with this dryer. I have very thick, coarse hair (4c), medium length. This dryer beat my old Conair dryer hands down - it takes about 30% less time to dry my hair. The design is perfect - comb attachments slide in and stays in place during the entire drying process (my old dryer's comb would always pop off at least twice and I've broken two comb attachments in as many months). I also like the width of this dryer. It does get very hot so use a high smoke point oil like coconut to protect your hair while drying. Bottom line, this is a very good product at a very good price. I also got the Andis flat iron - my new dynamic duo!
Switch buttons are not easy to change. Hot air is not as strong as I expected.
A big loud, a bit heavy, very strong.
I have to five star this one!Just got this a few days ago and LOVE LOVE LOVE it. I was using a lesser power one before, and wow, no comparison!Dried my hair SO quickly, yet made it bouncy and beautiful.The amount of air blowing out was just perfect, and using the attachment enabled me to center in on certain portions of my hair and style using it.I love the bright blue color, it's made very sturdy, and the cord is very flexible while styling.LOVE.This product was provided for my unbiased opinion.
Ok so i have thick coarse hair and i was looking for something that can tame this head of mine. First let me start by saying I do like the retractable cord. Must have now. I like that five settings this offers, (hot,warm, cool, low, and high) i do wish there was a medium  but its not bad. My only thing is i can not use either of the attachments and i know that because of my hair, however there is always at least one attachment i can use, not this time. It gives you recommendations based on your hair what settings to use. Overall its not a bad dryer. Has many nice features just wish it came with more or different or even other attachment options.
My hairdresser uses this blow dryer and recommended it to me when I told him I did not feel mine was powerful enough. This dries my hair in a fraction of the time as it used to take me. I love the adjustable settings for heat and for power, and the Ionic blast button for cold shots is great, too.
Wow!  First and foremost, if you have long hair this is the Hair Dryer for you!  I have long hair and constantly fight with the air intake valve on my other hair dryers as they suck up my hair and it gets tangled up inside!  The Rimini by XTAVA  has mesh like metal over the air intake valve and cannot suck my hair into it. Secondly, it is powerful which is probably why it says professional in the name and oh SO quiet compared to all the other hair dryers I have used.  Third, it is light and the handle makes it so easy to use and to reach the different control buttons while you are still drying.  Love that it has a cold shot button to help set my hair.  It comes with a control nozzle that fits very well and is easy to get off and on to precisely aim the air right where you want it.All in all I will tell you this is the best hair dryer that I have ever owned and it is aesthetically pretty too!  I won't get into all the specs because you can read them above but it does have 3 heat settings and yes, I use them all during one drying and it has 2 speed settings plus the cold shot button.  It usually takes about 20 minutes to completely dry my hair and with this one it took about 12 minutes.  I did receive this to try in exchange for my honest review and I will honestly tell you that this hair dryer is awesome!
Love the retractable cord and the dryer quickly dries my hair.
Dryer does not work good at all! The high setting is more like using the low setting No power! I have another Revlon Travel version I bought at Walmart for 12 dollars and works so much better than this. Very disappointed and waste of money. DO NOT BUY!
Ordered as gift and they were thrilled with quality, price and shipping!
Good basic hair dryer.  Like all the rest prolly won't be handed down to my grandchildren, but serviceable.
If you have all the time in the world…buy this hair dryer. Agonizingly slow!
good product I have nin type of complaint, I am satisfied recommend this seller and product
Very light dryer, and has a nice grip and feel to the handle.  I have very long hair and it dried my hair very fast with very little frizz.  I would highly recommend this dryer.  I love it!
Just like the ones in hotel.
Folds up perfectly, good heat and power.
Works well but you need a lot of space to store it.  It's like a giant robotic arm.
Good little dryer.  Cord running from wall to unit little too short.
Small and convenient, however heat seems low and hairdryer is rather loud.
I am so happy with this dryer! It's not too loud, like the design, and easy to pack. The only thing that would make it a perfect dryer would be if it had a medium setting. I would highly recommend the Andis dryer.
Awesome hair dryer
GREAT dryer for the price...nice features...the light may be just a bit too bright, but if you need a nightlight, its' great.
Love it! Dries hair fast without tangles!
I love this hairdryer because it's small, and lightweight, yet quite powerful, both in heat and flow.  The switch is very easy to use, and I prefer a small white hairdryer to be accidentally seen on the bathroom counter, instead of a huge heavy clunky black and chrome model that doesn't fit in a drawer when I need to tidy up.  This one is also small enough for travel.
This is a nice looking hair dryer that works fast. My hair usually frizzes out when I blow dry it, but not with this. My hair did not feel dried out at all after using this. The blow dryer has hot, warm and cool settings with a cool blast button. The back opens easily, so that any dust buildup can be removed. The weight is a bit heavy, but the design makes it nice to hold. I took off one star because the diffuser did not do a great job on my wimpy curls, but the other attachments worked out well for me. The color is nice, but if it came in green, that would be even better. The best blow dryer I have used so far.
Good item
Amazing design! Good power, comfortable to use!
Our old hair dryer has seen better days,so my niece picked this one because pink is her favorite color. Revlon is a name that's been involved with hair,so I said why not. The dryer seems to dry hair well,and my niece likes the color,so it's a win-win!
Admittedly, I don't have a ton of hair, and while this is a really nice blow dryer, if you're a guy with short hair, it's pretty extravagant.My wife and daughter, on the other hand, noticed a huge difference. My daughter isn't a huge fan of getting her hair dryed, and happily, this dryer reduces the torture time exponentially. I want to say the difference is in the diffuser, but there's more going on here. It isn't quite magical, but it's close.The magical part is probably with my wife's naturally curly hair. During the winter months, there's been some investment in products that control frizz, and I've been able to casually tell a difference between products. With this hair dryer, though, you'd swear some really expensive salon-grade stuff was used. The results are pretty surprising, and seem to last. I'd almost go as far as saying that this could save money, by reducing (or eliminating) the need for control products.At first, I was positive there was no way this hair dryer would be worth the money, but seeing how well it works with everyone in the family, I'd totally recommend it to anyone with curly hair, or who can't tolerate much time under the dryer.
We liked the convenience so well that we bought one for the guest bathroom too.
I first tried this hairdryer while staying at a Marriott Resort.  I loved it so much that I purchased 3 of them.  It can be set to blow at  the highest power with the heat at a lower setting -- something I found to be perfect for me.
Best dryer out there! use it daily
So, I got this in hopes that it would inspire me to completely blow out my hair.  Looks great when the hairdresser does it but I get bored about halfway through.  The jury is still out- three neat attachments that I have never in my life used and more options than I know what to do with- cool, warm hot and then high and low, and finally a cold burst....I'm used to just on or off!it is a little top heavy so not the most comfortable.  But so far so good.
Love love love this product salon finishing and the cord retracts! Best part had it for over a year it's really good
Really great.  Got it in 2 days on a Sunday.  Thanks.  I love it.
I got the leopard print and it's beautiful!!!this model is a little bit heavier than the Babyliss TT tourmaline titanium (the white one), but it does dry the hair in HALF the time!!! I have long hair around the middle of my back and I dried it completely in 4m25s. With the Babyliss TT it would take about 8-9 minutes. Do this is completely worth it!!!!
I like that the speed of the blower is separate from the heat selection.
love my dryer
I tested this hair dryer against two older models we have. One was a Conair with ceramics in the wind tunnel and ionizer. The other was an older BayBliss hair dryer, also with ceramics but no advertized ionizing properties. I didn't use a towel at all for the tests because I figured, if it works as advertized, the Panasonic should dry out my skin less well too. It seems to work.All three are very good hair dryers. I think the Panasonic did the best job of not fizzing up my hair and leaving it feeling very nice. HOWEVER, it stinks! It smelled like I was blowing melted plastic all around the room. That is not the case when I use either the Conair or the BayBliss. Additionally, while both the others are premium models, neither cost more than $50.I'm going to let the Panasonic air out for a month or so outdoors in the sun. Maybe some of the plastic stink will outgas and it will be a great hair dryer. Many people aren't as sensitive as I am to these plastic odors. If you love that new car smell, especially the smell of mostly plastic interiors after they have baked in the sun with the windows up, you'll love the smell of the Panasonic. I can't stand the smell of Fabreze or Bounce but maybe you think they're wonderful. If so, you'll think this dryer is to die for.I think they have the makings of a very good product. That nanoe technology seems to work. However, I'm concerned that each of those tiny little water droplets is surrounded by plastic particles, making it all the easier to find its way to my lungs. Hopefully, airing out will do the trick but I would still recommend a redesign to keep the hot air away from plastic parts.Addendum: I initially gave the product 5 stars but upon reflection I have decided there is no excuse for putting out a product that runs hot air directly past plastic when companies have been making hair dryers with metal or ceramic coated nozzles for years. Yes, recycling water vapor is a great idea, but don't forget to use the best of older technology as well. Plus a hair dryer this expensive should have a dual voltage switch.Update: Because of the smell, I gave the hair dryer away.... to my barber. He uses it frequently and likes it. After more than a year, the bad plastic smell is almost gone.der technology as well. Plus a hair dryer this expensive should have a dual voltage switch.  Update: Because of the smell, I gave the hair dryer away.... to my barber. He uses it frequently and likes it. After more than a year, the bad plastic smell is almost gone.
Loooooved this dryer. About a year and a half in and it's no longer working. Not an awful timeline but disappointing for the price.
so far so good
Exclent product, just two minutes tondy my hair without damage
this blow dryer is good at first but it's quite tricky. The blow dryer begins getting very smokey .. Something about the smell of the blow dryer doesn't seem right . I wish I listened to the reviews because the blow dryer died after one month and a day. A lot of smoke and fire flames came out of the blow dryer. Very scary . Do not but this blow dryer it may be okay at first but once you start smelling the burnt smell tuh better think twice when the return days are up. Waste of money! Do not buy this item. Going to stick to the cheap blow dryers. This was expensive for no reason perhaps maybe the watts? ( 1900 ) only good thing about this blow dryer it speeds up your drying time a+ for that.
Works well
I always thought a blow dryer was a blow dryer and they all did the same thing.  Boy was I wrong about this hair dryer.  It is not the same as all the others.  I have straight, thick hair and have a hard time getting volume due to the weight of my hair making it lay flat.  I do blow dry my hair to give it some volume but it usually doesn't last long.  But with the Panasonic hair dryer, I get so much volume! It is amazing!  I don't know if it is due to the moisture being put back into the hair but my hair looks great and others have told me the same thing.  My hair also seems to hold the volume almost all day long which is unusual for my hair.At first the dryer took a little bit of getting used to as it is a bit bulky, but it is light weight.  After a few days I got the hang of it and now I am getting the most out of the dryer.  Several heat setting make blow drying easy to get the results that you want.  Love it!
Good!
bulky and too noisy..
Amazing
LOVE this hair dryer! It is excellent for drying curly hair, which needs intense heat in one area. Light weight and not overly bulky, this hair dryer has a nice handle that is easy to grip and use when you have to dry hair for awhile. Curly hair sure can take time to dry and this one does not make your arm or grip ache, due to the long use. I recommend for anyone who wants a great, affordable lighter dryer that has concentrated heat!
I have to say, this dryer is amazing! I have long, thick, naturally curly hair, and I use a hair dryer a few times a week with a round ceramic brush to straighten it. I previously had a $150 professional grade dryer (5 years, and it finally died), and I did some research prior to buying a new one to see if I could save that expense. I bought this dryer and I was shocked that it actually worked BETTER than my $150 dryer! My hair is softer, the blow out lasts longer, and it dried faster then my old dryer. Must buy! If it works on my difficult to straighten hair, it will definitely work on anyones!
Im amazed at the negative reviews. I have had this dryer for about 3 years and it is my favorite. Recently, the retracable cord hasnt worked well, I tried to open it to fix it, then I broke off another part. Now, I use this dryer 1-2x/day. I paid under $20 at Walmart, so I sure got my moneys worth.I ordered a conair here on Amazon that I will be returning and purchasing this one AGAIN.It is VERY powerful, I love the retracting cord and fold up handle.
Works great. I replaced my Sharper Image ion dryer after 10 years with this model. It works great and has the same specs as my other model. Only at a fraction of the price! Highly recommend.
So far, the hair dryer has worked great. I gave it only four stars because it is difficult to move the slide controls for the heat setting and for the blower setting, which are side by side. So, I just leave the controls set where I want and plug and unplug the dryer so that I don't have to change the controls after I plug it in. If I remember, I will write another review in one year, if it lasts that long!
Does a good job for the price. I like the diffuser.
Just received it; yesterday; delivered on time, no problem.  It's so cute and improbable, like a Barbie-doll toy hairdryer in very pink plastic, just like its picture online in its box, complete with miniature pink plastic diffuser & concentrator. But it works as well as a larger hairdryer, certainly far, far better than a hotel wall dryer, and better than some full-sized ones, too. And it is extremely light, not tiring on the arms. The diffuser successfully brought out waves in my hair; the concentrator straightened my bangs.  I bought it to fit in my carry-on luggage, which it does nicely. What's not to like?
I have had a hair dryer for years when it gave out. I have always used Con Air products and have been very happy with them. This hair dryer does NOT disappoint.  Great product has several sets to choose from and a cool button which is really neat feature I never had that before. It has high power but not overwhelming for you or your hair. Love this product and love Conair!
Excellent product.....
Like many people, I have been buying the very cheap hairdryers sold at consumer retail stores like KMart and Walmart. I assumed they were good enough but they never last very long. I finally decided to get a pro model. This hairdryer is what my hair stylist has so I decided to try it. I am sorry I waited so long to treat myself to such a nice experience. The quality of the air flow, the excellent sound and the overall feel is well worth the cost. I hope it will last many years.I do wish the diffuser had come with it. However I have one on order. Also I took off a star because I would like high heat on low fan to be just a little hotter.
Light weight and efficient.  Very easy to use.  Just what I wanted for travel, when I don't want to take my big heavy dryer.
Good solid unit.  Feels super well constructed.  I am an electrical engineer and appreciate the solid heavy motor.  This likely means it will last.  It moves a bunch of air.  It heats quickly and strongly without odor.  Does a terrific job on hair.  Noise level is quite low for the amount of air its moving.  The surface finish remains excellent after 6 months of heavy use.  My wife loves it.  The buttons are placed such that neither one of us inadvertently changes the settings during use.  Neither of use uses the attachments so no help there.While I stress the solid feel of the unit as a good thing, I don't feel it is too heavy and neither does my wife.  I guess it depends on your expectations.  It will probably strike some as too heavy.  Not us.
Excellent product for such a great price. Hearts well, folds even better! Impressed.   UPDATE...   After using it maybe once a month (4-5 times since purchase) the retractable cord no longer works. Very surprised because it seemed like a pretty good product. Still works decently well but that sucks!
It is the best
Super Deal.  Super Price.  I bought this on Amazon after reading reviews.  It works great.  I have no complaints whatsoever.
Switch is hard to turn on/off.
I got a pro-versa instead of jerdon,amazon says pro-versa makes jerdon,no speeds or heat settings,just on and off button,unfortunately its already  on wall,did not notice til after,heck of a time putting it up also, very difficult,will not buy again
Fine product
The on off switch is broken. The only way to turn it on is by pressing white button on plug and turn it off by unplugging.  Not what I normally expect from an Amazon or Revlon product.
The retracting cable feature stopped working on me after a year. The dryer still works great after every day use.
Boughtt in July 2013....now the hot setting goes from hot to cold all while in the HOT setting.....
Easliy installed and works well.....
works great
When it works, it a lightweight and powerful hair dryer. However, it started to make weird noises and squeaky sounds after 1 year and three months. Other hair dryers I used usually last more than 2.5 years!
This is a really good hair dryer. Most other models either have low airflow or are very loud and hurt my ears. This one is hot, has high airflow and the sound is soft and easy on my sensitive ears.
Great product and price. Strong airflow and nice setting options. Get's my very long hair dry fast. Replaced older model that I had had for over 5 years. Hope this one last as long
This is lightweight and powerful.  I bought three of them so that I could use two as gifts.  I love it.
Dries my hair very quickly, the different heat settings are wonderful! It works perfectly.
Really good blow dryer my first 1 finally just burnt out after 4 years, and I refuse to use a different blow dryer besides this 1... So I'm onto my second 1 but hey after 4 years its about that time!
Worst blow dryer I have ever purchased.  The attachments do not slide on well, it does not dry my hair well, and the bristles on the brush aren't stiff enough.  Unfortunately I missed my window to return the item. I'll have to buy another brand and will just keep this one in the garage if I ever need to blow something dry.  At least it wasn't very expensive.
T3 makes the best hair dryers. This is my third T3 dryer...the first I had for 4yrs it only broke after being dropped for the tenth time, the second I had for 2yrs it shorted out on vacation in Cuba (no fault of the dryers just my own stupidity, they are made well & to last) and this third T3 I've had for 1yr. I have long, thick, corse, frizz prone hair & used to burn out other hair dryers in only a few uses whereas these T3 dryers dry it super fast with no frizz & it looks shiny after and they last forever. The concentrated nozzle is great for smooth looks and I love the diffuser for beachy waves. Invest in this dryer and you won't be sorry, just don't take it on vacation & it will last for years and years.
mom loves it and it works so I guess it's great.
Don't waste your money. I bought this for my 14 yr old daughter for Christmas. She was very disappointed & so was I ! It has only been used or attempted to use just once. After 5 minutes of frustration my daughter gave up trying to dry her hair saying that it just doesn't get hard or blow hardly any air.  We're keeping it to blow dry our dog, a small pekingese. Other than that, it's useless.  Again, save your money & skip this product
Very high powered drying with 3 heat settings, and 3 power settings.  Really like the way it streamlines the air.  Have not tried the diffuser yet but I am sure it works well.  Got it to replace a 20 year old dryer that was on its last leg.  Only one coil was working.  Dries my hair in about a third of the time.  Would recommend to a friend.
It is hard to find a pistol style hair dryer these day. I assume that majority went less bulky shape because it look nicer. My first priority is quiet operations and this pistol shape produce quieter air flows.
I like the blow dryer. I thought it was going to be a compact size but nope its a big one. I love the color and its very light weight
Just got the Remington last week, cant be more happy with it. The three temperatures on it are just right I am excited to say that  there is an actual difference between hot and warm air. Unlike most other hair dryers this one does not damage or overheat  my hair.  After I'm done using it my hair feels soft and doesn't feel tangled.Another great thing about it is the amount if air this little guy pushes out. I can dry my hair on a cool setting withing 5 minutes no problem, and if I use warm air it takes me about 3 minutes.This hair dryer is pretty light weight so styling my hair easy and takes little time.Love this model especially with the cost of it. It's a GREAT BUY. If you are in the market for a good hair dryer,  and are looking for a reasonable price this is it.  worth every penny.
what an ingenious idea!!!  great hair dryer!
This dryer is amazing.
Purchased in February 2014 and quit working in November 2014.  I should have heeded the other negative reviews.  And if Amazon were brick and mortar or had a phone number where I could contact them, then possibly we could have at least discussed, and/or they could have offered to replace the dryer with a working one.  It only worked for nine months; come on....
It takes some precision switching fr hot to cool & vise-versa, otherwise it's great & I can mount on the wall folded in half w/no cord.
I have always hated blow drying my hair, but this dryer makes it easier due to the handle being so thin. I usually use it on low settings and it works great. I love this hair dyer.
Perfect size for gym bag
It's the best hair dryer ever! Love it soooooo much. After using it, my hair becomes more shining and healthy. Definitely recommended for everyone!
Be careful that you are selecting what you want.  I didn't read the description closely and thought it was the kind of dryer I was replacing that wired into the wall.  This one plugs in to an outlet and it has been a challenge to mount since the footprint of the base is smaller than the one I had previously.  My fault, not theirs, but the image looks exactly like what I had.  We eventully bought a picture frame, put scrapbook paper in it and bolted the dryer mounting to the frame and the frame to the wall to cover the previous dryer's footprint.  A bit of a challenge, but the result looks OK.
This hair dryer does a wonderful job.  My hair comes out shiny and, with the diffuser that is included, I can maintain the curls and waves that are natural to my hair.  The nozzle can be set for precision when drying and there is a cool shot button in case the air feels too hot.  Three temperature settings make this dryer versatile and useful for wet or damp hair.  There is also a quick-dry nozzle attachment that disperses air throughout the head and makes drying very quick.  I would only recommend this if you are in a  rush because I found my hair duller looking when I used this attachment.  However, there are days when a quick dry comes in very handy.  The hair dryer's description says that it utilizes ions in the air to maintain moisture in your hair.  Whatever method it uses, it really works and is the nicest dryer I've ever had.
It did not fir my hair dryer.
Hair dryer is very suitable for my fine, short and not very thick hair. I used it on the lowest setting and it felt just right: gentle and not extremely hot. I also liked its comb attachment: it helped me dry hair faster.Comparing this dryer to my older Philips (I moved so I had to leave it in another country), I must note that this dryer provides weaker blow. I think it is because of much bigger output vent.Minus 1 star because there is no ceramic heating element - just wires.
make hair blowing time a breeze
great Product !
great
Good product and good company to order from.
Product as advertised.  Works well.  Boost button nice feature.  Power switch seem a tad fragile.  I am satisfied with this purchase.
Still going strong and I use it daily
Works great
It works very good and really worth its price. Recommended +++
arrived as promised
This hair dryer is fantastic! I have thick curly, long hair (almost all the way down my back) and it takes about 4-6 hours to air dry my hair. I hate hair dryers though because they make my hair brittle and dry. This one does not do that -- in fact, y hair looks shinier.It's very easy to operate.
use it every day
Grand budget buy plenty of power and heat and nice and compact too.
Great small blower for home, its compact and slick design.  Just make sure don't drop on the floor, it might damage the fan easily.
I'm glad to buy this dryer. It's powerful enough to dry long hair in a few minutes.
I am not one to buy an expensive hair dryer, but this Panasonic with Nanoe technology is worth every penny.  The quality is self-evident when you open the package and pull out this professional sized hairdryer.  Although it looks like it would weigh a lot, it is surprisingly light and easy to handle. The controls are simple on the handle, with one side of the switch for temperature, cool, warm, and hot.  The other switch is for high or low air flow, yielding 6 possible combinations.  The Nanoe comes with three nozzles, which slip onto the front of the dryer.  The Set Nozzle for precise styling, the Quick-dry nozzle for drying hair quickly and the Diffuser for creating full bodied hair with volume and styling.  The is also a Cool Shot button on the handle to temporarily turn of the heat, to allow time to style.  The dryer comes with a heavy duty 9 foot cord with a safety overheating/reset plug.The Panasonic has Nanoe technology, which takes moisture from the air and your hair and puts moisture rich particles, small enough to penetrate your hair shafts.  That's quite a mouthful.  What it did for my hair was make it soft and silky, and I can see nuances in the color which I didn't notice before.  The blonde is blonder, the brown is richer.  My hair dried quickly and quietly, none of the loud buzzing in my ear.  As I run my fingers through my hair, there is none of that dry, frizzy, overblown feeling with my lower priced dryers.For results like this, you need to make an appointment at a salon.  If this is in your budget, highly recommended.
Not happy at the quality of hair dryer for the price I paid 28. Better version at Costco for 20. I had a previous conair hair dryer that lasted 10 yrs and was very happy with it. This one had cheap plastic on/off button and just low/high speed blower.
I bought this for my rental and haven't tested it out myself but it's perfect for that.  Not sure about everyday use.
LOVES:+ Great for travel+ Includes a storage bag+ And includes two additional pieces to attach (concentrator & diffuser)+ Small & lightweightTHE BADS:- Does not have cold air settingI purchased this when I was in college (at the college store), and it was perfect for the constant back and fourth travel. And I still use it to this day when traveling. I love how small it is, and yet it still gets the job done.
Very very good quality
worked for 5 seconds then stopped working.  due to moving, this disappeared so I couldn't return, but i must have gotten a dud.  I'm going to stick with my regular ionic blow dryer for gentle effective hair drying.
Love this hairdryer. I found it in a hotel in Houston and had to have one for my own. It blows at a great temperature--just hot enough but not so hot as to burn you--but is very fast due to the high velocity of air it outputs from the dryer. This is the fastest (and best) dryer I have owned.
Very convenient. Love it. Hve it in every bathroom
Great professional hair dryer.  The only reason I'd dock it a star is the noise.  I'm thinking about buying the silencer to see if that will help.  Otherwise it really gets the job done!
Great dryer - does its job - no complaints..weight and feel are great - so no issues.the rotating handle is a little strange, but it is a nice feature when it does need to be folded & stashed away.
good value!
We have used this  for 7 years . We have four and have only replaced 2.  Visitor dropping it, slipped out of hand. Like the ease of use. Speed and form.
Too loud !! Not enough heat!!
not super strong, but does the job. can't beat the price :)
We love it, we put it in our RV because an RV that we owned had one and I think that they should be a standard feature in all RV's
I absolutely love this hair dryer. Its construction makes it easy to handle regardless of which portion of my head I am drying. It also does a beautiful job of drying and subduing the texture of my fine, course 4C hair. I don't have to use high heat to get the results that I am loving, loving, loving.
Not powerful enough and not a good value for the mney.
I have always loved Conair products and used them for years. I had an old Conair hair dryer since early 2000's and it finally took a dive. What I loved about my old dryer was how lightweight and powerful it was. I searched on Amazon for the same and/or similar style and came across this. The Conair 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ceramic hair dryer is as good or better than the older version, which had the same wattage. It is lightweight, powerful, and so comfortable to use. The switches were an important part for me. I love the slide switches because you can grab it by the handle and not accidentally turn it off while you're using it. I have very long and thick hair and this gets the job done! If you're the type of person who doesn't want sore arms when drying your hair, this is perfect for you!
Good, work well
I had used it once in a hotel.  I like it getting my hair dry as faster as my old one, and a big plus is it didn't sound loudly as my old one.  Yes, it's just as what I want.  Then I rushed online, and ordered it.  It's been 4 months since, it's still working good.  Love it.
Super good!
This is a great hair dryer and I love that it hangs on the wall--right where you need it.
Not al all what I expected. Low air output.
This dryer replaced my dryer of 4 years and has a lot of power. I would recommend it to everyone!
Does the job perfectly and fitted my hairdryer with no issues.
This is completely adorable and comes in a zebra striped bag.  What's not to love?  Oh yeah, great job at drying my hair as well!
Works well and not too noisy.
This item is exactly what I replaced. Thank you
I was replacing this unit with another Sunbeam wall mount that my wife had for nearly 10 years. When this arrived first the hi-low setting didn’t work. Also it isn’t hard wired so you have a cord dangling off the wall. That was my fault I didn’t realize it when I ordered it. So I returned it with no hassle and ordered the wall mount hard wire unit with three settings and no cord to tangle. A happy wife is a happy LIFE.
I have had this for less than a month. I love it. But after the 2nd time I used it, it started sending BLUE SPARKS out! It is the best hair dryer ever, and I'm afraid to use it because it might explode or set my hair on fire. I know there is a warranty on it. I have just emailed Remington, but have not heard back yet. I would have given this 5 stars if it wasn't SPARKING IN MY HAND! Hopefully they will send me new one.
Received on time and as descried.
absolutely Love It!
A great hair dryer.  Excellent features, and very attractive.
Fits great ! Works great!
so far no problems with it just a bit heavier but nothing else...
This is a good little hair dryer. The only problem is the noise it produces. It sounds like a jet engine in the high mode.
best dryer a gir could ask for.. this is perfect for my natural hair
Works great.
It makes a lot of noise, but it dries my whole hair in less than 5 min.
Space saver. Works great
does its job. love the cool sitting and the feel of it.
Works as expected... great.  The individual heat / fan speed controls are a very nice feature.
this is a nice dryer but I saw NO change in the time it took to dry or the way my hair felt and looked after use.Bottom line... Not worth the $$$
Love this dryer. Best I've ever owned! Love how it is so quiet as well. Even my son said it's the best.
Cute but cheaply made.
Although I bought this for travel, I like it more then my regular sized dryer.Its pink but appears purple in the picture, thats the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5.
Worked fine for me
My favorite hair dryer over the yrs. Great for traveling as still find the occasional lodging without dryers.
Good buy
Best that i have ever owned.
Love it
I really don't notice a difference in thus dryer and other dryers. My hair still gets very frizzy whIle drying and hard to manage.  then if it's humid out stays frizzy. My hair doesn't look healthy when I use this. It takes me a long time to blow dry my medium thick  19inch hair. Again,  I don't know if all dryers would be the same for me but I mostly let it air dry than use this.
Not what I expected. The dryer is poorly made.  The nozzle flies off about 3-4 times while I'm drying my hair.  It's very annoying!  I will most likely return.
its okay but with only 2 heat control is not good
So far so good!
It's fairly compact and not very noisy. I would have liked a bit more air volume, but it's ok in that respect. The night light was too bright so I disabled it. If it lasts as long as my previous Andis, which was 18 years, I'll be well satisfied.
Works perfectly. Strong and compact
Replacing earlier unit, same model. Found only on Amazon:)
Excellent, powerful motor and it leaves my hair very shiny
Love it - not an overly strong blow dryer which I like because I don't have thick hair.  It's nice and light so my arm doesn't get tired.  No frizz either.
I love it....
Makes my hair so smooth with no frizz!
Good size, good power.
I used this hairdryer for the first time at a resort that we were staying at and just loved it.  I loved the idea of the retractable cord and folding head,  it just seemed to dry my hair so much easier and better that what I had used previously.  Before I left the resort I went to my computer and looked it up and was amazed at how reasonably priced it was and ordered one right then.  I highly recommend this dryer!
Excellent.....
very bad hair dryer, it stopped working soon.
Good quality
Good
I like this hair dryer, it's worth the price. Thank you
Excellent! Finally my hair is like at the hairdresser hahaha
I liked this dryer a lot, and it was a great dryer for the price.  However, a month after the warranty expired it started shooting out green sparks and losing heat.  Probably won't bother with this brand again, as I see the same thing has happended to other users.
Awesome- worked just like it said it would!
This inexpensive blow dryer works great! I'm an African American woman and my hair isn't straight. This gets it there. My daughter has curly hair and this does the job on hers as well. I love it! It's a quick and easy blow out!
Work Great !
I really like this hairdryer!  I bought it to replace my Andis 30975/HD-10L 1600W Quiet Hangup Hair Dryer with Night Light.  That dryer broke after a year of use and had a disgusting bright green nightlight.  This Sunbeam is wonderful!  It is very powerful and super compact on my wall.  The only complaint I have is that the on/off button are not on the handle but on the hanger.  I prefer it to be on the handle but that is just a personal preference.
Light and very quiet.
Dries my thick hair quickly and makes it really smooth! Awesome!
Works great.
strong wind
Works Great!
I NEEDED A GOOD BLOW DRYER BECAUSE I'M GOING NATURAL AND THIS IS WHAT I NEEDED TO KEEP MY HAIR HEALTHY.THE QUALITY IS NICE AND THE PRICE IS NICER.
I spent more money on this dryer than I have any other before. Was it worth the price? I don't think so.It is a decent dryer....super fast drying...so if you have thick hair, you'll love it. My problem is I have thin, fine hair and I'd prefer a lower setting. I can use the Scalp setting but even that is a bit powerful. I like a lower setting to style my hair better. This just blows it in all directions. I don't see that much difference to be honest in the end result as I get with any other dryer.I won't send it back...does the job but I still like my old dryer best which is no longer made.
Its a hair dryer! Works fine.
I bought this hair dryer after researching for more than probably 20 hours to figure out which one would fit my needs, etc. It has been well worth it! My hair dries more quickly and I'm getting awesome results with my round brush like I usually get at the salon. I would definitely recommend this product.Even though I would recommend this product, I am highly disappointed to find out that buying through Amazon and a 3rd party I am not covered by the warranty because neither of the companies are authorized resellers of the product. I found this out as I was completing the warranty form that has to be sent in. Had I known this ahead of time I would have gone to one of the authorized seller sites and paid $2 more to have a 1 year warranty. I am returning to Amazon as one of the authorized sellers has 20% off and no tax.
excellent
This hair dryer functions properly and is light enough to maneuver, but the buttons are a challenge (and I'm a middle-aged person). You need to slide them up to manipulate the heat level and another parallel set of sliding buttons to turn it on. It's a struggle every day.
Bought this so that my 9 year old could begin drying her own hair.  She liked the bag that it came with and she has no problem holding it...the full size driers are a bit heavy for her.  If I dry her hair I still prefer the beastier full size....its faster.
conforme con la venta y recomiendo al vendedor
Perfect!
I could kick myself for throwing away my old bonnet hair dryer twenty years ago.  It worked fine but blow dryers were more efficient.  I bet that if I still had it, I could plug it in and it would work much better than this model.  This model is such poor quality I'm shocked that someone would even sell it!  The unit is ok (after 3 uses) but the bonnet is so cheap that the plastic connector pulled away from the bonnet on the second use.  I suspect that the glue they use is not heat resistant and it melted, because it started to emit a chemical smell right before the plastic ring fell out of the bonnet.  Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money for a reputable manufacturer.
It's a nice hair dryer. Dries hair good. Has different options to chose wether you want to dry it with cold, warm or hot air. During my life I had different kind of hair dryers, and this one is as good as my other ones. Did not really noticed the difference. But it does what any hair drier suppose to do. And yes, it's made in Thailand.
The only negative reviews I read about this (and all other dryers) is that some die too early. Hopefully this one will not suffer from early death syndrome. It is ideal for bathrooms with limited counter space. We are extremely please with the design and the white night light is a nice feature and not too bright as was mentioned in reviews of alternative models. Chose this one after analyzing reviews of all models. It is a little more expensive but well worth it.
Works well. Lite weight for travel or home.
Very lightweight but powerful. My hair gets dried very quickly.
Really nice find.  Saw this first at a prominent New York hotel and thought 'if it's good enough for them ...'  We've been very happy with it.  How long it'll last?  Who knows.  But so far, so very good.
dood
dryer is excellent ,night light not to good.
Do not buy this.  Bought mine in Sept o1, 2014. Went to  dry my hair last night, Nov 8 , 2014, would not turn on. Only used this dryer maybe 6 times, only blow dry my hair if  washed late at night. To late to return to Amazon.  Six uses that is it.  It does have a reset and test  buttons which I  pressed several times. Still the dryer would not turn on. Not happy that I spent $40.00 for a hair dryer that I used only six times.
This is the second time i've purchased this dryer. It's long lasting. i had my last dryer for 5 years and it only broke because i dropped it twice really hard on tile floors. It still worked but i could hear it was not doing well so I purchased another one. If you need a diffuser, Bio Ionic Universal Diffuser fits perfectly. This is the best dryer for thick hair and beauties with natural/curly hair textures. Its really strong. I do hair on the side and its perfect for heavy use.
Perfect. Always liked these off the counter dryers in hotel rooms.
Works great and it is nice and compact.
excelente producto llego en el tiempo previsto recomiendo a la tienda
I am very surprised to be writing a raving review about a hair dryer.  I never really gave much thought to my hair dryer and the potential damage it could do to my hair.  My last dryer (it was either a Clairol or Revlon-I threw it out after it starting throwing sparks) left my hair extremely dry after approximately two years' use.  I kept switching shampoos and conditioners, thinking that my hair was just changing and I needed to find a new product.  Turns out all I had to do was buy a new hair dryer!  Before purchasing this dryer, I read a few online articles that suggested a lower wattage dryer for fine hair.  That is basically how I ended up with this dryer-it was the lowest wattage dryer (besides a travel dryer) for a reasonable price.  I have only been using it for a few weeks now and the difference in the feel of my hair has been unbelievable - extremely soft!  In addition, the dryer is surprisingly quiet and dries my full head of hair in less time than my prior dryer.  Overall, I recommend this product.
Excellent! will surely buy again. Does the job right.
Light weight, not too noisy and plenty of airflow. Not sure it will last a long time, but well worth the cost. Bought two of them.Update since reviewing this, both units have failed in the same way, power switch stops working. Too bad, these are cheap, light weight, not too noisy and good airflow.
great buy!
It dries my hair so quick leaving is so smooth, LOVE IT!!!
A good buy for the money.
nunca recibi el producto. me gustaria que me repusieran el dinero por favor
Perfect for anyone. I use two of these in a rental condo with zero problems.
Good hair dryer but kinda heavy
Wonderful hair dryer.  I bought this one for my camper and after using it I put my more expensive one in the camper and brought this one in the house. It dries my long hair much faster and somehow leaves it less frizzy.  I was skeptical of the ionic feature but after using it I will not use anything else.  I love it!
More money makes for a better upgrade.
This is the only diffuser of this variety I've ever found that has short fingers.  Normally the fingers are so long that it is impossible to get the heat close enough to my hair to not take forever to dry.  (I hated those long fingers when I had long hair, and I still hate them now that I have short [not even to my chin] hair!)  This diffuser does blow hair around a bit more than a traditional diffuser (for example, the old school ones w/ the black foam-like material), but this doesn't bother me since my curls are uneven in texture and lend themselves to a beach-y, messy type of look.  Might cause frizz for tight curls, though.
This hair dryer is the best anywhere. This is my second purchase due to one of my granddaughters breaking the previous one. Will order again in the future if need be.
It is a good product if you're using small or medium rollers.  The bonnet is too small for Large or Jumbo rollers so I only used once and packed it in my closet for whenever I decide to cut my hair shorter and can use smaller rollers.  It only came with one attachment, not two like the picture shows.  I like how you can store the hose, bonnet, and power cord inside the case.
Was easy to install (instructions made installation seem more complicated that it was) and works well (no louder than your average dryer).  I like not having to unplug my dryer, wrap the cord up, and place it in a drawer.  What can I say, a minute saved is a minute earned, and I reclaimed much needed drawer space by replacing my old, bulky, heavyweight dryer with this wall mounted one.  I only wish I had purchased it earlier.  It is also very lightweight so my arm doesn't get tired when I'm drying my hair.
awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It's really safe, and convenient. I could curl my hair or just dry it.
great
I love it.  It's perfect.  It actually works and does what it says it will.  Accurate temps and a wide range of temps.  Very adjustable.  Only slight downside is it requires a strong hand to screw in stuff when setting up otherwise it's wobbly.
I found the Conair 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ceramic Hair Dryer very hard to turn on, choose my heat selection and choose the intensity of the blower.  I think Conair should have made the ridges on the two selectors more pronounced.  I also found the low setting far too powerful to comfortably style my bangs.  What I do like, compared to other hair dryer makes is that the cold air button was extremely user friendly.  The dryer itself works just fine and is comfortable to hold.
small, light, powerful, good amount of heat.
Would like it to have more power but love that it is more quite than most!  This hair dryer works well and I always use it on high as anything lower is not very strong at all.  Its a great price for the quality. I bought it to replace one that was screaming loud and it is so much more quiet than my old one! I appreciate that it will not make me loose my hearing while helping me have a good hair day!
Used this for year, still awesome!
does good
strong powerful air flow, dries hair quickly, nice compact size, lightweight.  Wish it had a better button for controlling the 'shot of cool' setting.
I've used this little guy daily for the past 3 months and I gotta say I love it!My only problem with it is how bulky the plug is. I mean, seriously, if you want it to be a PORTABLE dryer, don't have the end of the cord be almost as big as the handle.In terms of performance, however, I cannot complain.
Great hair dryer, just leaving a quick review to state that, like others have stated, the matte rubber covering on my dryer is all peeling off on the handle (and taking the words with it...). This doesn't affect the usability of the dryer, but it's ugly and I have to memorize all of the settings before they disappear. It took about a week of everyday use before mine started to peel. Otherwise, the dryer dries my hair in an expeditious manner, which is really all you can ask of a hair dryer. :)
Very good!  Excellent. It works. I love it!
Unfortunately I banned it wrong power connection for australia
best dryer I've had in years!
This has to be one of the best hairdryers Ive bought. The plum sparkle coloring is spectacular. It is a little heavy but not real noticeable. The only thing that erks me is where the buttons are. If you are use to holding it a certain way, you may have to change that. I miss having a rewindable cord too, but thats okay with me. It is great! My hairstylist even thinks so!
I love it!
Works great so far, heats up fast, and was a good price! No issues so far!
GREAT FOR HOME USE !!!!!
Just what I wanted.
Excellent
I don't know why there are so many negative reviews, other than maybe operator error. This hair dryer is great, it dries my hair much faster than my other Revlon which is about 3 years old and I love the different settings. I wash my hair every other day, so it doesn't get daily use, but so far so good. The cord will only retract well if you have the handle extended, if you try to fold the handle and then retract it wont work. It is nice and compact to keep folded in my bathroom.
I can't say I am disappointed, but my last Conair was better.  However, it burnt out within a year, possibly because I dropped it, but this time I didn't want to spend too much cash to replace it and that one is no longer available.  FYI--The one I had and bought on Amazon was:  Conair 213XP Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Technology Ionic Styler, BlackI selected this one because I was so pleased with the last one.The color and functionality of this dryer are it's best features.  It probably makes a better travel dryer than anything.  It doesn't allow you to adjust the temp (cool, warm, hot), but it does have a cold shot button.  You can only choose High or Low speeds.  I totally missed those details in the online description that before my purchase.  I did watch the video and it is what sold me, but the video makes this dryer look more powerful than it really is.  Perhaps if you don't have thick hair like me it would perform more to my liking.In my opinion, I don't think it is even close to salon performance.  It says it uses ion technology, but my last Conair that was labeled ionic worked so much better and dried my hair faster with hardly any frizz.  This gets the job done, It dries my hair pretty fast, but my hair is very frizzy after which annoys me.  I will probably take the plunge and buy a higher-end hair dryer in the future, until then, this is OK and will get me through!
Blow dryer is awesome!  Works great
On high heat dryer blows hair so hard you cannot style the hair, it just frizzes. On medium heat the dryer doesn't get hot enough when styling. It takes forever to dry on medium. In my opinion this unit is best as a blow dryer, not a styler.
Excellent product. Light, powerful and practical.
I had been using something similar for years.  It had belonged to my 95 year old mother and lasted through her life and most of mine and one morning I turned it on and zilch, it had died.  Since I am pretty much housebound I wondered what to do next.  Good ole amazon came to the rescue.  It arrived much sooner than originally planned and I was delighted.  The equipment works extremely well with various speeds and protective gear for a bathroom switch.  The only fault I found was that there were other pieces for directing air flow that came with no explanation of how to connect them.  I don't use them anyway but it would have been nice to have had some directions especially for the mechanically impaired like myself.  Otherwise a wonderful hair dryer for a cheap price.
Great hair dryer, gets your hair dry in no time and the cord  gets store in the same dryer, my daughter loves it, thanks a lot!!
good, very strong wind
Good deal
great value.  not a professional one, but great for home use.
I have purchased this blow dryer more than once over the years and I like the way it works
I love this dryer. Keeps countertop de-cluttered and right at hands reach. I Was used to more air pressure but have adjusted to it. My sister also bought one and loves it.
This item works well. Although the medium and high settings seem to be the same. But it didn't really bother my because i was trying not to use it on such a high setting anyway to prevent damage.. my only complaint is that i wanted to dry my hair using the cool button, i found that pressing it made my hand hurt, it wasn't easy to hold down, felt like i was getting a cramp. And depending on what product you have in my your hair the whole dryer might slide from your hand. Other that that it seems to be a good product, it gets the job done, and doesn't feel wimpy in the hand.. if you have curly or corse hair then you won't find the brush attachment helpful.
I like it. Not to noisy. Not to heavy.
Love it so far. Very strong blowing unlike some of the other dryers I've owned.
Dryer itself works fine, but The on off and temperature switches are poorly designed and hard to use.  If my hands are wet or have hair products on them I can't adjust them at all.
The cord does not retract very well.
I have a few of these for different rooms. Works well and cord retractor makes cleaning easy.
Good product for it's price.
I think I should give this hairdryer a five star cuz for the price and the size, it's definitely a satisfactory for me. Would be perfect if it could bent but what the heck.It does the job really good with 1200W. The nozzle of course helps a lot.I got the older blue Conair travel hairdryer, can't remember the name and I liked it, but this one is way better.
excelente
This works great I love it.
Good price, blow strong. Not too big.  Love it.
Great hair dryer, salon-quality. fast shipping.
I absolutely Love this Blow Dryer. Its Lightweight, easy to handle, quite and Powerful. Great Buy
just ok
I am not a salon styilst, just someone who likes to dry her hair at home at anytime, even at midnight if it is when the time is available. I used to go to a beaty salon to have my hair dry. It took usually 45-50 minutes for my stylist to dry my hair, which is just not long, thick and wavy: I have a lot of it, too (my stylist used to joke saying I had to heads in one, but sometimes another stylist would come to give her a hand... imagine to people pulling at your hair at the same time... it felt as if they were trying to split my head in two, sometimes!). My stylist is great, and became my great friend, but no matter how well she treated my hair, and how many conditioners, etc. I used, my hair got scorched enough that a some of it was always breaking in half, the natural waviness lost in an ugly way (the half of the hair closest to the roots, the other half wavy still... When I had my hair wet, it looked weird).One day I decided to get myself a blowdryer, and got the FHI 2000. Which turned out to be great, and while drying my hair with difficulty at first, because of my lack of practice, I managed. Seating in front of a mirror, I would bravely spent 1 hour drying my hair. It was worth it! My hair changed a lot, and the huge amounts of money I used to spend at the beaty salon were no longer necessary. Once I encountered my former stylist in the supermarket, and she thought I was visiting another beauty salon, she didn't believe me when I told her it was me (she didnt tell me, but from her face I could tell she didnt believe me).After a bit more than 3 years, my FHi dryer fell to the floor and the little fan inside broke. I strongly advise you not to attempt repair with any other generic piece of whatever that is not original or not from the FHI repair service (if they have any, I dont know, because I live in the Caribbean). I did that, and regretted it a lot, since the repaired dryer damaged my hair. I had to condition it lots and lots afterwards, but I have to wait for my hair to outgrow the damage (grrr!).Then I decided to get myself a nice, professional hair drier, and checked the Babyliss Pro with all the great feedback. After using it and learning to manage it (because it is so fast!), I cannot stop myself from congratulating me for my accurate decision! My sister tried it (she has wavy and think hair too), and immediately ordered one for her. I dry my daughter's and mother's hair too. The drying time is much less now, and the hair is great! I notice that while I still have damaged hair from the repaired old dryier, the half hair closer to the roots which is not damaged has remained healthy, keeping its natural waviness for when I decide to let it dry alone.The Babyliss Pro is powerful, fast, and easy to manage. It is a bit smaller in size than the other dryer I had, which is just fine for me. I feel that since the blower is so fast, I can avoid the heat fto touch my hair for so long, thus making a more healthier drying experience for my hair everytime. For your info, I use all the buttons at full speed always. I can have my hair ready in 35-40 minutes.ds, but I have to wait for my hair to outgrow the damage (grrr!).Then I decided to get myself a nice, professional hair drier, and checked the Babyliss Pro with all the great feedback.

Great heating appliance.  Works great and dries hair quickly.  If you fall asleep under the dryer don't worry the timer will wake you up.
Works great.  I wish the bonnet was larger
Love this blow dryer.  I have naturally curly hair and it often gets frizzy after I blow dry it but I can see a difference when I used this hair dryer.  Not perfect but definitely better.  Someone mentioned how quiet it is and I absolutely agree.  The first time I used it my husband commented on how quiet that hair dryer was.  Great blow dryer.  Try it you will like it!
I love it. I bought one for my daughter also.
I have the full size T3, and I am very happy I purchased this travel size. It really does work to keep your hair less frizzy, and dries really quickly. The folding mechanism works well, so it fits nicely in my carry-on bag. I love the idea of not having to use the dryer in the hotel room.
Love this dryer. I have two... One ant home and one at the lake place!
Works great
Hair dyer stopped working within one month.  Not reliable!!
I absolutely love this dryer. It has simplified my hair routine and save on so much time. I would definitely recommend this.
LOVE LOVE LOVE! this is the best hair dryer I've ever seen. It's really light, very quiet, and dispenses a small burst of cool air from above the nuzzle, which is unexpectedly brilliant. It also folds so it doesn't take too much space in my luggage when I travel. The chord is a bit too short, but with an extension is fine.
It was a nice hair dryer, came highly recommended by several sites. Unfortunately, it only lasted about 10 uses before the power began to surge and there was a distinct ozone odor coming from it. For safety I shut it off immediately. I don't use a hair dryer that often, so I had already had it past the time I could return it. I don't know if mine was a dud or not or if it perhaps was damaged some way in shipping, but I hesitate to buy the same model. It was to replace a dryer that had lasted me over 10 years, so I am very disappointed.
This hairdryer makes my hair look fabulous! I didn't think that it would make much difference, but it did!!
best hair dryer ever!!!! i didnt care that much abt a hair dryer so most of time my hair was fuzzy. this hair dryer really works with its function choices.
So far so good!  The dryer is very lightweight, which I love.  Love the pink too!  The price was right as well --- all around a good purchase!
as advertised
Has no power.  Thought I would spend more and get a dryer that was better but it was not worth it.Makes a horrible whine sound when I use it and takes a long time to dry my hair.
BEST.HAIRDRYER. EVER!  Love it!
for the price and  size of item works ok.
The Best.....
Small but powerful. Dual voltage, great for travel, easy to pack. Very light, so much easierr to work with, than the larger, heavy ones.
Used this at one of top brand name Hotel, Like it very much, air volume is good with reasonable noise. Excellent product.
So hot I couldn’t use it except to thaw ice in my freezer.
this dryer did not blow with much power, I returned it.
I'm sorry that I have rate this product 3 stars without trying it out but I would like to share what happened with this item. I received this package today and was really excited about it. When I opened the box I saw at least 4 small bugs crawling around in it. This was enough to make me immediately close the box and bring it outside my house. As for the product, it looks great and as pictured but I didn't get a chance to try it because I am sending it back to Amazon tomorrow. I don't believe that this pest issue would be from the product so I think it must have happened in the warehouse/packaging stage. I'm disappointed that I didn't get a chance to try this blowdryer but I will not be ordering another one for fear of the same thing happening again.
Works well but both of us frequently turn of the hair dryer by accident because of knob placement..
Excellent First  Introduced to this product at several 5 star hotels and figured it must be durable and it is.  One has lasted 5+ years with near daily use. New one is for guests. Have read a few negative reviews and figured customers got a lemon  It happens!
Great blow dryer, great price and very light weight.
I am very happy with the hair dryer so far. It works perfectly. My hair gets dry quickly and it is so easy to use. I mostly bought this hair dryer for my daughters. They have longer hair and it costs me so much money and time to bring them to the salon. So now I have my own salon at home. I couldn't be happier.
it is so far so good.
Ordered 2 ,they work great!
I LOVE THIS DRYER!!! Salon worthy rollersets every time!  Gets nice and hot and drys my hair quickly. Quite enough that you can hear the tv and have a conversation on the phone. Fits my large head lol and purple and black rollers okay. Its a tight fit BUT it DOES fit.
Tiny, lightweight, but packs a powerful punch!
best dryer ever! time saver, and eliminates frizz, and changed my hair from drab to fab :)!
Love love love!!! It's quiet.  My hair dries quickly and with more volume than my previous dryer. I can't say anything bad about this product.
Excellent
The adapter with the spikes was horrible.  It was very hard and hurt my head. I am returning it.
The hair dryer I purchased in June has burned up and has to be replaced. It was great while it was working and wife loved it but surely it should have lasted more than 3 1/2 months.
This brand was recommended by my hair stylist.  It is perfect to straighten hair; however, for soft curly hair such as mine, the heat is too strong even at low level.  I have to use the old hair drying when diffusing my hair.  My daughters, who happened to have mixed hair, love this hair drying because it straightens it fast and without drying it.
this dryer was received on july 5th 2014 and stopped working on october 27th 2014. I purched two of these, I hope the other one last longer than 4 months.
For the price, a very good and flexible hair dryer. The retractable cord, the many levels of heat and volume add up to a very functional unit.
Air flow was not as strong as I'd hoped it would be.
Awful sound and no power.  Returned it.
I love, love, love this hairdryer!! It dries my in half the time my old one did. And it doesn't get hot to the touch like my old hairdryer did. My only complaint is that it's heavier than I expected but not so heavy that it's unmaneuverable.
Great Product. Lives up to its promise .Its been 2 months so far.Love my hair after I use it !
Bought this for my wife before leaving on vacation. It works great.Pros:-light weight-dries hair quickly-folds up for easy packing in the luggageCons:Cord not long enough for my wife to plug in and use while showering :-)
I like it, meets my expectations.
This little hair dryer packs a punch! It's surprisingly strong for it's size.  Great purchase!
Very good product, I've been using it for half a year, works good.
Love it!
Thank you
exelente.
This Conair product is my favorite. This is the best dryer. I have bought it as a back-up for travel to the samemodel that I bought awhile back. It is a great dryer and functions a long time. My very first was purchased some years ago and did not die for many years of everyday use. I highly recommend it.
glad I purchased 2 one for each bathroom they're great no more looking through drawers to find the hair dryer
I works great and was a good price.
Infrequent user.  Second purchase of this model.  First one lasted a few years until the cord didn't retract, and then something came loose and smelled chemically acrid.It moves air and dries fairly well.  No particular change in frizz-level compared to others.Temps are spot on with me; it's nice to know I won't get burned nor be frustrated by a too-cool warm.I've gotten out of the habit of electric drying both for ecological reasons and for noise/hearing damage.  The only person really bothered by my wet hair or the results if nature-dried is me.  I don't find it any louder than any of my previous dryers, but my DD hates it with a passion. I'm thinking about using it as punishment (not really, but I probably could).  I don't get it, though. That's how hair dryers sound.  She winced at a 1200W mini, too.My cord retracts just fine, not like a shade, but I'm glad to have the heftier/safer cord without a vicious, finger-eating spring.  it took hundreds of in-and-outs for my old one to give out.The switches could have benefited mightily with even a slightly a concave dragging surface.  This strikes me as an efficiency design that wasn't.  It's not intolerable, though. If it bothered me that much I'd glop some plastic adhesive on it to give it a thumb-knob or edges.I  &#60;3  love &#60;3  the surface. It's totally Lenovo (not cheap).  It's *great* (grippable) if you don't always use the handle (like when the handle is folded in).  That said, it's not makeup-friendly, or rather, it is.  Oily pigmented stuff shows up on this and can be hard to get really clean. 90% rubbing alcohol does the trick.  I still love it.My attachments stay on, tightly. (Save the rubber bands from your broccoli and wrap them around the dryer exhaust to increase its diameter.  Cram-like-heck the attachments onto the dryer.  There are other solutions, too. like flexing the tabs with  a screwdriver.)I'd say skip this, frankly.  Go for one with easier switches and a lower decibel output... at a higher price.
its really amazing! i tried lots of hair products to rescue my sensitive hair and nothing works better than this hair dryer!
It was reviewed as being effective on high selection and not so much on low.  That has proven true but the product meets my needs perfectly.  It was delivered promptly and in excellent condition.
Awesome! Hair dries faster and looks smooth and shiny!  I took one star off is because of the cost.  I even didn't mention to my hobby how much this thing cost.
So great l love it , drys my hair so good and fast lm dominican l have curly thick hair . So lm very happy with my turbo
Not as powerful as described but better than most mini hair dryers.Small and lightweight.
This product is crap. I should have read the reviews! It is so loud you need earplugs to dry your hair. The cord won't retract with out an extended battle. DO NOT BUY!
It is an excellent hair dryer. This is the second one we have purchased!
When the right order did come, it was perfect !
The worst blow dryer I have ever had! This dryer make more noise than blow hot air. I let my hair partially air dry than blow dried it, and it took forever to dry (between 45min-1hour to completely dry using the blow dryer). That was the longest it ever took for my hair to dry and my hair isn't long or very thick , it's ear length. It isn't a strong blow dryer AT ALL! it gets hot, but that's about it! 😒
Bought two for guest bathroom and so far it's been perfect. Lots of power in a little size
This dryer is wonderful it is even better than I expectedThanks
Love this hair dryer - I had brought one similar to it in June 2013 - so far this one is performing well.  I was aware of some of the defects that others had complained about - but so far so good.  Its a keeper.
I have a mini pro and thought the one I ordered was similar. It was bulkier to use and heavier. I returned it. The Mini Pro is what I hope to purchase as my current blow dryer, still working well, will need to be replaced in the near future.
Good but could have one option faster, but the rest work great for person how doesn't has a lot of hair.
I have been using these dryers for quite a few years and I am fully satisfied with their performance and durability.  My wife, who uses a fancy high power dryer has put hers aside and taking possession of mine. It is small, comfortable to use, dries well and it is quite dependable. You need nothing more.
Excellent, strong, light weight hair dryer for travel and every day. I love it!!
Good one as expected...and my wife using it....she is happy to use it....
I have used this blow dryer for about three years now and I love it. My daughter is constantly stealing it from me so I just purchased one for her birthday. Would you believe that was her favorite gift?
Great little dryer, small, compacted, reliable and drys my hair. I dont think there is much more to say about this. I do use it everyday.
THIS DRYER IS OK. YOU JUST HAVE TO TURN THE HOSE AROUND TO DRY THE TOP OF YOUR HAIR. I HAVE HAD A HARD TIME LOCKING THE HOSE ON THE BONNET.
wicked cute ! great delivery :)
Works very well and a great size
For the money, this hairdryer is hard to beat. I use it for other purposes than drying hair. It's easy to turn on, easy to adjust speed and heat settings. The cord is just the right length, the color is nice, it's just right. I can recommend this product.
I like this dryer. It helps to straighten your hair. I do hate that the combs are plastic and probably won't last too long. If you have really coarse hair be careful with the combs because they just might break. All in all it's worth the price.
This little dryer works well as a travel dryer, especially since it folds. However, as with most small dryers, the noise it makes is pretty horrifying - loud loud loud.
Best blow drier I've ever owned. Light and powerful. The power button is actually 2 buttons side by side. One button controls the heat setting and the other controls the fan speed. I really like this feature because you can set it on low heat and the fan on high.
great for the price
Dries my hair in half the time. Love this dryer!
I love this hair dryer. It really does leave my hair shiny and softer than my old one.
only one speed HOT Burnt my ends Had to get rid of it
I've had this hairdryer for years now and it works just as well as it did the day I bought it. High-powered and hot, which creates the perfect blowout with or without a round brush. I really love this hair-dryer, and I take it with me whenever I travel.Update--- 2 years post review and it's still going strong!
excellent product
I bought this dryer for personal use at home. It works well to dry my naturally curly hair. It's like air drying but a lot faster. I will also use it to do deep conditioning treatments or process colors. The down sides are the large bonnet and it being top heavy and needs both hands to maneuver. The other odd thing is that when using the dryer a small clump of hair gets pulled up to the screen. At first I thought this was going to be a problem, but it's not an issue.
Very Good Value For The Price... She really likes It because of 2 speeds and 2 heat settings.
Impressed!  At first I thought 1000 watt wouldn't do much, but this Bonnet Hood Dryer packs a punch.  I've used it twice so far and love my results!  This dryer will pay for itself after another 3 uses - so honestly, I feel like I got it for free as I don't have to go the salon to get my hair done!  I'm not saying I won't get my hair done professionally but this will definately keep my hair groomed until I do.LOVE IT!
Great dryer when it worked.  I purchased this hair dryer in January 2014.  Only used it twice a week on the low heat setting up until now.  Yesterday while using the dryer on the low setting the motor speed suddenly became very low and the thermal switch inside kicked the heating element off.  This is the second Vidal Sassoon of this kind I've purchased.  The first one lasted six years.
Exelente
Just got it.It broke right after the first use.I tried putting it in different sockets, still didn't work. &#62;.&#62; Horrible defective product.
Broke right away.  Plastic end over filter screen popped off, dangerous because sucks in hair.
clumsy apparatis - I wanted more mobility - like multitacking and this is not set up to run with the flow - hose waned to stay on box and I wanted it to travel with me - my own problem - it was meant to be stable
Does its job at a great price. It's also extremely light weight as well so I carry it in my carry-on bag when I travel.
I love this hair dryer! Not only does it dry very well, but it is extremely light-weight and perfect for travel! It's also not too loud, so it doesn't wake my roommate in the morning.
I love this hairdryer. I ordered it for college and it works great. It's not only small but it also packs a big punch. It warms up quickly and gets the job done. I go home and I hate using my mother's hairdryer because mine is so much better than her expensive, bulky one.
So far it still working.
I have purchased these for every bathroom!  Not only are they handy, you don't have to waste space in your drawer.  The night light is also a gr8 feature for finding your way to the bathroom at night.
I love this dryer! Great power!
I wish there was a comb our brush attachment other than that works
Had a little problem setting it up but doesn't hold my hair blower exactly in place
My third T3!
Excellent portable hair dryer with plenty of power.
The dryer is excellent! Exceeded my expectation.
Not the best blower in the world but great for under $15. High, which would be high heat and strongest blow, is more like a medium heat and medium blow. I wouldn't recommend this for someone who likes really hot dryers that blow very hard. However, for me as a man, its good enough to get my hair to stay back.
Got this for more than just drying hair. These are handy for drying winter gloves, boots and hats. I also use this to shrink electrical insulating tubing and window insulator kits. A heat gun gets too hot for other projects and this is about right. Has a nice soft grippy feel in the hand too. Blows allot of aire on high.
I've used a Conair Blackbird hairdryer for years and absolutely love it. My hair is coarse and it has the power to dry my hair without causing damage.
Great product
Nice little dryer…fits great on the wall and has a lot of power.
bueno
First time I set it up the base where the wheels are cracked! !!
Love this hair dryer, but the handle area turned pink within about 2 weeks of using it.
I loved it but It did break after 8 months
The blow dryer is awesome however the attachments fall off when trying to use. We had to bond the comb attachment to the unit n
great for the price. i needed a slightly more powerful dryer for my thick hair but no complaints.
work great and I'm very satisfied,Great seller! Fast shipping.Great price and Quality product.Loved the item.Will buy from this seller again
Very light & dries hair quickly without frizz.
Within nine months of purchase this hair dryer stopped working - overheats within minutes.  I don't even dry my hair but a few times a month so this is not the best purchase.
Nice one.....
Quiet and fairly light. dries nicely without scorching. The pink hue on the buttons and filter housing was a surprise, as it didn't really show up in the photo, but , hey, it's just a hair dryer.
I have long hair, and for the price, it does a good job. The only drawback is that I feel the vibration more so than from other hair dryers. Worth what it cost though.
Perfect.
This is worth the money.  Don't waste your money on the cheap ones, spend a little extra and get one like this that is good for your hair.
Doesn't get very hot, take longer to dry hair
Easy mounting but very little power. I recommend you get one that has 1800 or more watts.
I loved this dryer. It is super light, small and super powerful at the same time. It is very strong and drys very fast. excellent product, I completely recommend.
My wife loved it, it's a big step up from her mothers 1960's, THE HOTS little blue Hair Dryer that has nearly burned down the house at least 3 times already.
Powerful, well-designed and worth the money.
My Elchim from the 90s finally died and it was like a death in the family.  My hair, while I used a temporary hair dryer was atrocious with frizz and stray hairs everywhere.  This Elchim showed up and it was like a miracle.  The hair dryer is just amazing.  I read some of the reviews and there was a burning smell for the 1st and maybe 2nd time I used it, but never again.  It leaves your hair silky smooth!Oh and regarding the heaviness...don't judge a book by its cover.  It is heavy until you use it.  Then magically the weight is distributed nicely.  Don't ask me how...some kudos go to the designers!
Don't believe the High-velocity airflow statement - this hair dryer only had a low & medium setting.  I don't have what people would call a thick head of hair and it took a long time for me to dry what I have.  The hair brush was flimsy and the bristles were mangled when I received it.  Another thing I didn't like was that it is quite heavy and the handle is long so it makes it seem even heavier when you are holding it.  I ended up returning it since it was pretty useless to to.
Hair dryer blew up the third time I used it!
I liked it when it worked, but now it doesn't have very much power.
Very disappointment. I should have read the reviewer before I brought this dryer. Because of the price it caught my attention. but it doesn't dry the back of the hair. Terrible designing!!  That all I have to say.
with one arm cut off due to and accident it does the job
This little dryer is my favorite.
Had a hard hood dryer for over 10 year. Yes it worked great..donated it to my neighbor.. this software bonnet puts the heat in all the right areas of your head. Light weight. go too the Landry room and fold clothes while on my head.Lol..Yes I do plug it in there
so far ok
Good, quickly dry hair
I couldn't believe I had found such a great quality product for a great price. I was in the market for a new hair dryer but couldn't afford to spend an arm and a leg on a fancy blow dryer. I did a lot of shopping around and finally came across this one that even came with the attachments I was looking for. I bought it and was worried that for the price the product wouldn't be as described. I received it and it has 3 different heat settings and two different levels. It also came with the attachments which work great! This blow dryer is still going great a few months down the road. If you are in the market for a new hair dryer and want one that is functional I definitely recommend this product.
I have had this dryer for almost 2 years.  If I could give it 0 stars I would.  Today, a flame shot out from it and nearly caught my hair on fire.  It was like a torch.  This is so hazardous!
I was excited to receive this blow dryer and be able to test it out, since I've done allot of research for a good quality inexpensive blow dryer with enough settings . Especially because I have fine hair, a blow dryer that doesn't get extremely hot was a priority. I absolutely love it , it's everything that i was looking for & i like the way it looks. Only one con is , it's pretty heavy. I would recommend this item
I love my hair!!😃 thank you
really nice！
haven't used mine yet but my girlfriend has one and she loves it :)
Love it! Small and extremely light-weight but packs a good amount of power.
Very nice little hair dryer for the money. Good reviews are what sold me, and I wasn't disappointed.
I absolutely love this hairdryer. It looks like I came out of salon everytime.
