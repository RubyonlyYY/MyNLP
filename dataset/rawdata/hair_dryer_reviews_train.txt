Works great!
This dries my hair faster that bigger, more powerful models. I love travel blow dryers because they are easy to lift and they usually come in 1600 w or less. Bigger dryers are heavy and blow my hair everywhere. This has a surprising amount of power and is very compact. I would give it a five except that the switch is not easy to turn on and off with one hand and it's noisier than I anticipated.
Love this dryer!
styling hair in style
I just got this last week. I think's great. The cord length is perfect.
Excellent dryer.
Gets extremely hot - I have burned my hand on both the metal grate as well as the plastic body. After use I have to keep on the counter because it is too hot to put away. It has melted 2 different combs and now starts to smoke during use. My hair requires high heat to dry completely and not be frizzy, but this is unsafe and ridiculous. As soon as my new model arrives (not this brand) this is going in the trash!
I found everything goes well except the plug. Why the left and right is opposite and I have to put the plug upside down for charging!!! Another flaw is the big noise.
Perfect
I really like this hairdryer. I haven't had it very long. But it's working well for me.
Got tho on super sale. Love it! Cuts my drying time in half
Reckon I have had this about a year now, at least 7 months. Works great, I use it 5 days a week, blows hot air, doesnt overheat, isnt to big, came quick, didnt cost much. Get you one, you will like it.
The styling tip does not stay on, keeps falling off in the middle of blow drying and then it's too hot to put back
Nice hair dryer, dual voltage comes in handy.
Great product... Took me anywhere between 30-40 mins to blow dry my clients hair with my old blow drier.... With this new one its cut the time in half... It's has lots of power... Great deal... N it's super cute...   Update: 7-8?months later it only blows cold air. I wouldn't recommend this drier for the price they are selling it now. It's rubbish
Like this as well as the one I had before.
Very quiet. Bought this to replace my girlfriend's stupid loud blow dryer that woke me up every morning. This thing is much easier on the ears.
this is a good dryer with nice attachments...very light and powerful. The only drawback is the switches. If your hand has any mousse or oil on them, forget turning this on without a struggle. The switches have no grip nor heavy grooves on them that make turning on/off easy. But, overall good.
Live this hairdryer
Perfect for travel.
thanks
I've had this blow dryer for just over a year, and it finally started smoking and sparking so bad, I believe it would have caught on fire if I didn't turn it off.  For the last 6months, if not longer,  I've noticed that when I 1st turn it on it smells really hot and the air flow is very low.  But after fiddling with the heat controls and the cool button it will gradually begin to blow at the normal flow.  I've used cheaper blow dryers in the past that I get a minimum of 3-5 yrs out of!!!!  I'ts the weekend and Andis is closed, but I'll attempt to contact them to see if there is anything that they are willing to do, refund/repair or even replace this unit.  Please note that on their website over half of their blow dryers seem to be discontinued, hmm wonder why. I'll update my review once I hear, or don't hear back from this company.
So handy, works great, frees up counter top space in my small bathroom.
After using the same blowdryer for probably 8-10years, I decided to upgrade to a new one. I have very thick (*VERY THICK!*) moderately wavy shoulder length hair. Due to my hair thickness, drying times were typically 30-45minutes. I wish I was joking. This dryer dries completely in under 15 minutes (about 10-12minutes more precisely). I am so thrilled with this dryer!! Can't say enough good things about it! I like the texture of the dryer itself, love the speed of drying and the cord is long enough to actually be able to use it! SCORE!
Works great.  Just wish it had a medium setting.
I blowdry my hair at least 3 times a week and I was using a really, really old, cheap, bulky one to get the job done. This dryer gets the job done a lot better! It's smaller, lighter, more ergonomic if you will, and dries my long, thick hair (not always a good thing!) reasonably quick! Great purchase, as long as it lasts as long as my old ones did :)
Love this, keeps my curls nice and not frizzes out.
Bonnet is too small
This is a really nice hair dryer from Remington. The handle and controls  are very ergonomic, and the head is well balanced so that it doesn't get to be a chore handling it. The heat settings are what you'd expect, and the dryer does a good job of getting your hair dry fast without too much static buildup. What I really like about this dryer is the generous cord length and the ability to hand the dryer from a hook. The attachments fit well, but the diffuser attachment comes in the handiest as always.
Great blowdryer. it gets the job done. the only thing i dislike is how it is not compatible with universal comb attachments. also as i blowdry my hair the attachment keeps falling off
Amazing amount of air that comes out of it! My wife and I love it... My waiting time to go out is cut in more than half!! Highly recommended. Feels solid like you are getting your money's worth. Has a nice long cord too..
So far, an excellent hair dryer. Not too noisy. Good controls. The handle is well contoured. My only nit is that the little plastic attachment that directs the stream of warm or hot air pops off a little too easily.
This item it's been working perfectly fine, I'm glad i ordered!!
It is so hard to find a small blowdryer. I'm very happy with this!
Perfect
Great dryer.
looks exactly as in photo. light weight and works like a charm. would definitely recommend
Small and strong.  Great dryer for travel.  Also has dual voltage.  Glad I bought it!
Not as good as the original Conair 1875. Makeovers and upgrades don't always yield the best results. For instance, this 1875 replica. Lacks the basic functions a blow dryer should have, such as temperature adjustment. There is only a setting for high and low fan speed. Also, in order to use the air only feature with no heat, the cooling button has to be pressed and held down to use this basic function. This causes a person's fingers to get tired, holding a button over using a sliding switch. Then there is the retracted cord that is missing. That was probably the most valuable feature for the original Conair 1875. Made the dryer much more portable. Even useful when not traveling. Now the new 1875 has its cord sprawled all over the bathroom counter. The original is much better. This is slightly smaller with about 10 watts more power and a directional air controller, but overall not worth the investment.
Seems to be working well, was easy to mount on the wall.
This is the 2nd time I bought this little hair dryer because I like it so much. My first one finally bit the dust after about 3 years. It's very small and lightweight--a plus for the suitcase, but still powerful enough to blow dry my hair fast. I have short hair, and this sweet little dryer is all I need to dry and style my hair--no need for a comb or brush. It's no frills--only 2 speeds--high and low. But it does exactly what I need it to, and it does it fast!
No complaints
not good
I have just used it once, but it worked great. Dried my hair in about 15 minutes.
Compact yet powerful. Easy to pack and travel with. Excellent value for the price. Much better blow dryers are available, but for the price this more than satisfied my needs.
Powerful, lots of fan settings, cold air button, and best of all, a retractable cord! I like the folding handle for traveling, too.Great product. I can blow my hair dry and blow out of here for a quick appointment!
So far, so good ...
The cold button stuck on the 2nd use.  Now have to have it replaced.  Just annoying to have to deal with this.
It broke the third time I used it piece of crap
Very powerful. Dries my hair quickly.
The ends are pink. Not what I expected
This is a very nice hair blow dryer.  The color is a lovely medium shade of pink that is in a matte tone versus a plastic looking shiny one.  The dryer comes with a diffuser which works well for my curly hair.  It has an unusual type of soft touch finish.  It doesn't feel slippery at all.  It fits well in the hand and the finish seems to be it fit a little more snug that others I have had before.The air filter is removable and be sure to clean it about once a week.  I destroyed a blow dryer by not cleaning the filter - it overheats the motor and kills it pretty quickly.  Along with the diffuser, there is a very narrow concentrator attachment which works really well if you need to put heat on a precise spot.  There are three heat settings and two speeds.  There is also a cool shot button for getting the air cool quickly as you are styling.The interesting thing about this blow dryer (apart from the finish) is that it is much quieter than others I have had.  My first thought was that it meant that it wasn't as powerful but that is not the case.  It works well and is not as loud.
Product is just as described. Super fast delivery
It's a good hair dryer for the price.  I do find that it smells like it's burning on High/Hot. I use it on warm and low so it's just fine for my needs.I tried a SalonSalon hair dryer at a friends house which was fabulous - turns out it costs $169!  Way out of my budget. This one will probably last a year and then I'll probably buy another Sassoon tourmaline ceramic - helps keep the fly aways from flying away!
This is a great hair dryer with loads of power.  It feels like a salon dryer.
The diffuser made my curly hair really frizzy and messy.
Cute and stylish
Not as hot and powerful as I expected and somehow it does not deliver any kind of expected shining usually produced by professional ceramic dryers...
This product arrived in an open box. The cord was pushed into the box. Looked as if it had been returned. But it arrived quickly and it works. Small easy to travel with.
Not a bad dryer! Yes, heavy, but sleek as can be and doesn't burn my hair.
I'm not one to write reviews but I thought I'd do it for this product. I have fine, curly hair but LOTS of it. It was taking me a good 25 minutes to blow dry my hair every other day and I was getting tired of it. I felt like I'd tried about every hair dryer (affordable) in the store. I decided I'd try an expensive salon one to see if that'd do the trick. So I splurged and bought the Buttercup Dry Bar hair dryer. It worked well but only cut my drying time down about 5 minutes and in all honesty, I didn't think it was worth the $200. I came across the John Frieda hair dryer and read some good reviews so decided I'd give it a shot, plus it was much more affordable than the Dry Bar. Well, I loved it! It only took me 11 minutes to blow dry this mane of mine plus it gave it extra shine and my ends don't look so dry. It also straightened out my hair better than any other hair dryer I've had which cut down my flat iron time, as well. The only cons are that the buttons are placed in an odd location and it has a weird hum but you get used to that real quick, so it didn't really bother me all that much. But I would definitely recommend this product!
I am giving this hair dryer 5 stars for being so amazingly simple!There are no frills or cool settings (Low, High, Cool) just basic user-friendly hair drying action.CAN I TELL YOU THIS THING LASTS! I've had mine for about 7 years now and works like the day i got it!Just do yourself a favor and unscrew the back every now and then and clean the lint out of the filter (wire mesh on back)
I bought this for my girl to keep her from buying another Walmart bargain. I can tell it's quieter than most and she says it dries her hair faster. Nice lightweight unit, ergonomically designed. The cleanable filter on the back is a nice feature.
Bang for the buck very good. Good quality
I've owned like 3 or 4 blow driers in my time. I'm not so good about consistently using them because I'm lazy. Well, I also know how harsh blow-drying can be on hair (particularly colored like mine), so I tend to avoid it. But every so often (more so in the winter), I find I need to dry my hair quickly instead of waiting. My last hair dryer died in a blaze of glory - well, actually it more or less fizzled and refused to turn on. So when this popped up in my Vine selection, I selected it.This Remington hair dryer comes with attachments - one, a diffuser, that looks like an alien product (apparently used for curly hair), and a funnel appendage that reminds me of an airplane wind tunnel. I don't have curly hair so I didn't bother with the diffuser (I really wish it had not been included because all it does it take up valuable drawer space), but I did test out the Wind Tunnel (much as I like pretending it's a wind tunnel for miniature airplanes, I would like to know, what is this thing called really?).I love all the settings! My last hair dryer pretty much had hi-lo, hot-cold and that was it. This has 3 heat settings and 2 speeds along with a cold blast setting, allowing for a more controlled drying experience. I found it really dried my thick, wavy hair well (another reason why I hate drying my hair - it usually takes 30 minutes for it to be all dry) and relatively quickly. The Wind Tunnel also helped to ensure nice, smooth, straight hair - the way I like to style my hair.Overall, I'm impressed and pleased. I wish that the diffuser hadn't been included because I have no need for it and the space it takes up BUT I know that those with curly hair may appreciate it.UPDATE 09/18/16: While I still like this product, I have since received a Bio Ionic from Vine, which I like more. The Remington's Cool Burst is far too easily activated when I am drying my hair, a problem I don't have with the Bio Ionic. Therefore, I am taking away 1-star to show this.Brought to you by:*C.S.

Less heat and more blow would be better
It suddenly can't turn on days ago.
Great Hairdryer, affordable price, delivery was quick, like the packaging and the extra hair drying tips you get by email. Wishing it had a little bit more power in the cool blast but no big deal. Im pleased that I bought this product to replace my old hairdryer which took 20mins to dry my hair, happy to say it has cut the timing of drying my long hair down to 8minutes and leaves my hair smooth enough not to use the GHD hair irons. Only major downside is that it is quite noisy.
I love this hair dryer; the available speeds and temperatures are perfect and it's the most quiet hair dryer I've ever owned.  The only drawback for me is the placement of the on-off switch; it's located at the very bottom of the handle so I have to use two hands to turn it on or off.  A better design would be to reverse the placement of the buttons so it could be turned on/off easily with my thumb; currently, the speed/temperature button is easily reached with my thumb, but I don't change that very often.  That is the only reason I didn't give it five stars.  Nevertheless, I still highly recommend it and would buy it again.
This dryer is exactly what I wanted very lightweight and does the job
This is the best dryer I have ever used. It isn't all that quiet, and though it's not really heavy, it is bigger than I'm used to and so still a bit unwieldy in my unpracticed hands, but it dries my thick, coarse, shoulder-length hair faster than any other device I have ever used. It also leaves my hair notably silkier and more manageable than other dryers. The Allure would seem to offer the benefits of an expensive professional tool at a surprisingly reasonable price. Hoping it holds up over time, and planning to purchase another to keep at my summer cottage.
My wife is very happy with this hair dryer and she has very full, THICK hair!
So far so good
blow holes are only at the top would be great if they were at the sides
Never had a blow dryer tangle my hair and make it limp. It does get your hair dry slowly.
Good as expected
This is my third Hot Tools bonnet dryer in 25 years. I love it: highly recommend it. I, too had the bonnet constantly unhooking from the hose but realized after the second dryer that the bonnet has a notch inside the ring that clicks to keep the connected to the bonnet. The dryer does get very but with 4 heist settings I keep lower it after 10-15 minutes then every five.
Nice quality, fairly quiet, nice looking and not too big.  I bought two.
Very Much Worth It!
I was hoping for a quieter blow dryer. This is definitely quieter than my other dryer, but still not quiet. I also read all kinds of reviews that said this dries your hair so it's smooth and silky. The only thing that makes my hair smooth and silky is product!
Have had it for about 4 years and thought it did a good enough job.  I use it on  medium heat/blow settings and always clean the air intake screen at the first sign of lint.  However, it has recently been throwing out sparks and some actual flames.  At first it was a high pitched screeching noise, then popping, then sparks, now FLAMES!  It is in the trash and I will be looking for a better dryer.  Funny that my mother has had the same dryer for over 15 years, but this modern high tech stuff is just mass produced junk!
Best blow dryer i have purchased in a long time
I have been using an older model Remington hair dryer, and, while that model has held up well with daily use for over 3 years, this newer model is lighter weight and slightly smaller yet produces the same results as the old model.This Remington says that it has micro conditioners to prevent heat damage and increase hair shine. It also says that its ceramic technology prevents hair damage and dries hair faster.Since using the Remington hair dryers (daily) my hair (untreated and treated) do not show hair damage at all - no split ends, no dry/brittle, no fly-away. Whether this is attributable to the dryer or my hair product (changed when I started treating my hair), I cannot say. I use shampoo & conditioners about every other day and dry my hair every day.Dry time is fast. The new model doesn't seem to have a faster dry, but the dry time is pretty quick nonetheless. I do not use either attachment. This dryer comes with a diffuser (Remington caught flak with the last model not including a diffuser) and a directional blower. Both are standard plastic.Overall, this Remington dryer works well, dry well, and should last a number of years if it follows in previous models' footsteps. Very happy with the feel and results.
needs an expensive transformer
I love how compact it is and how amazing it works!!!
This is a great dryer for the price. I haven't noticed my strands being shiny or silky,  but the dryer dries quickly and isn't very loud.  I appreciate the different heat and speed settings. The barrel is longer than most other dryers I've used but it isn't hard to grip or control. It is boxed nicely and comes with a diffuser attachment. I would recommend this productIf you check out the pictures in other's reviews you'll see they have had luck with smooth, shiny hair. I have not gotten a chance to use it that much to see results and I've been using texturing product which also isn't conducive to smooth or shiny hair.
It's not that small, and quite heavy. It works reall well! But not really portable, or light enough to be a travel dryer.
Good experience will order again
will dry hair very fast
Great blow dryer !!!!
Great for the price!! Glad I didn't spend hundreds like I've seen on others!! Love it!!
I enjoyed using this at the beginning.  After few months of use, it gets over hot easily and I have to stop and wait until it cools down.
My purchase of the Hot Tools Tourmaline Ionic Standing Hair Dryer was a great investment. I love the purple and black color. It has two heat settings, high and low. Two speed settings, high and low, and it has an on/off ionic knob. It has an adjustable pole which is great when you have more than one person using it. It also has wheels so it is easy for me to roll it around the house. This is much better that the hooded dryer that I had to sit on the table and find a chair low enough so I could fit under the hood. I use my dryer on a weekly basis. The hood is very roomy and has a flip up front. I can dry my hair with large rollers with no problem. Now I can get the salon feel of the hair dryer at home.
A non working product. Just west of time and energy. Well they refund my money but I don't recommend this product.
Best one
This had terrible reviews but it was the only one I could find with the 3 things I wanted: diffuser, retractable cord, and folding handle. I figured for the price it was with a try. I'm so glad I did because I love it! I don't understand the negative reviews. It dries my hair quickly and my very curly hair looks great!
We have just gotten rid of all the hair dryers in the house to try some new ones (the last ones should have been thrown out years ago) and this one works great. My wife and daughter have very kinky curl hair and it takes time to dry their hair but this product cuts that time in half which is great. Very strong firm hair dryer that feels high end upon picking it up(although very affordable looking at the price). My daughter has taken over this one in her bathroom (she loves the color purple) so we have let her take possession of this one.Great hair dryer that you would expect to see at a high end salon.
This hair dryer is one of the fastest drying hair dryers I've ever used. It also looks sleek and professional. I like that it comes with multiple attachments to give you the best blow dry you can get.I only have a few issues with this particular hair dryer. It blows really hard. Even on the slowest setting, the air blows out very forcefully. If I need precision drying, I have to use the diffuser attachment, otherwise my hair gets blown to smithereens. Another problem is the rocker switch design. When I'm using this, the rocker switch controls on the handle are very easy to push and I'm regularly having to reset my settings. After I while this gets very annoying.It seems to be lasting me pretty well. I've been using it almost one year and haven't had any trouble with its performance. I hope it lasts me a few more years.Overall, this hair dryer is usable but might cause some frustration.
Absolutely the best hair dryer I've ever owned hands down!!!! I love this dryer so freakin fast it's amazing. Came in less than a weeks time. Very pleased!
So far so good.
Over heated in 2 minute! We had to return it and had to pay bubble rap to sent it back to Amazon. Good luck if you want to order this through online.
Nice quality.
It works great and I haven't had any issues at all.
I only had the blow dryer for less than 3 months and the heating element went.
I purchased the dryer about 9 month ago. It is alway stay at my home in one place. I occasionally used it and never moved it. Now it can not stand anymore. The plastic base and 3 legs are broken. I called the customer service and they said the warranty only for 60 days.
works great ! love it!
This thing is still going almost a year later
The speed and heat settings are wonderful. I don't get that gross feeling like it is burning my hair, or blowing it insanely, like with other blow driers. It is very convenient for storage.
So far so good
Nice quality.
Works just fine.  No problems.
Excellent  hair dryer
This is one of the best hair dryer you will probably ever find. It is very powerful and dries my hair quite quickly. Plus the folding design makes it easy to stash away. In addition, it's relatively small so it's not taking up a ton of room in your suitcase. A win all around.
I love this little hair dryer. I have arthritis and the larger dryers are hard to manipulate. I also have short, thin hair so this little dryer makes it easier to use a roll brush at the same time. I wouldn't recommend it for someone with thicker hair as the heat is not as strong or powerful as an 1875 but it's great for me.
Holy cow...maybe it's because my old dryer died 6 weeks ago and I haven't blow dried since (what can I say?  It's hot and I'm too lazy to fancy up in the summer) but WOW this thing works fast.  It's cute, it's small, but it packs a punch!
The dryer itself was really nice but the packaging could have been better.
cool speed is perfect for my hair.  no frizz or dryness
No warm setting! Can't use!
I wish it was a little bit stronger and a little bit hotter but it does the trick.. I have thick THICK hair and my blow drying skills are subpar so In the hands of a skilled person id say 4 stars!
It's good. I like 3 level of heat.
Great blow dryer, just a little more heavy than I expected
I love my hot pink mini-pro, so lightweight and Powerful!  The super cute tote bag is a plus!  Perfect for travel but I use mine everyday.  I didn't think it would be as good as my big, clunky, heavy dryer, but this little baby gets HOT, has a lower setting also.  I have shoulder/ hand issues and now they don't hurt when I blow dry my hair!  Love it!!
Good hair dryer. It can make your hair more straight but its kinda heavy compared to other hair dryers.
Excellent product.
This was a great hair dryer....for 8 months.  Yesterday the heating element stopped working and now it only blows cool air.  I thought since it was a Revlon product and it wasn't cheap that it would last for years.  I was wrong :(
I bought this for my sister for her to use it for college. it came really fast, she loves it and it's very affordable. thank you. 😊
Excellent hair dryer with some good features.  Some of these features seem to be from a marketer's mind rather than real.  It won't fix damaged hair...whatever that means.  It won't make your hair shinier, healthier, or improve your already good looks.  However, in real world day-to-day use it is very capable and effective at drying and styling.It feels solid and well built without being too hefty.  It has very solid cord connectors and circuit breaker protection built into the plug...excellent safety features!  The handle and controls are very well placed for ease of use.  They stay cool to the touch during use.  It has 2 speeds and 3 heat settings.  Low speed and low heat works best for us. It puts out a huge amount of hot air at high heat and high speed.  It has a cool air blow feature which is good for finishing the drying process.  It has a couple of attachments, a concentrator and diffuser, which you may find useful.  It definitely is not portable though it is transportable if weight is not an issue.Hair dryers are a commodity and there are a lot of choices.  This unit stands out in a crowded field and should work for almost all hair drying and styling situations and requirements.
I just love it
Love how light it is and how quickly it dries my hair!
This dryer works so good. I have really coarse and thick hair and it used to take me a really long time to blow dry my hair (with an ordinary dryer). Now I bet I have cut down my drying time by at least half if not more. Can't beat the price for this type of technology!
buttons interfere with handle.  always turning off
From Ms. s1rude.I've been using an older model Remington hairdryer for years, so I was able to compare this model to an another model of the same brand.I don't have a model number on my current hairdryer because all of the writing has been rubbed off, but it has a single switch to select hi/low warm speeds or cool mode. The AC2015C has two switches, one allows you to select between three temperatures, the other between two speeds. There is a cool shot button. I have fine, straight shoulder length hair and don't really use my dryer for anything other than drying, so I've never understood the purpose of a cool shot button. Were I to use this function, I prefer my existing drying because you can set it to cool mode with the switch, while the new model requires you to hold the button down continuously for cool air. The AC2015C is more than twice as heavy as and slightly larger than my existing dryer, which I didn't care for. Pros of the AC2015C are that it is a nice looking dryer, and if its anything like my old Remington, it will probably last forever. For now I'm planning to stick with old reliable; its lighter and more straightforward.
WORKS GREAT!! JUST WHAT I WANTED!!!
Traveling abroad?  Most foreign countries use 220 VAC instead of the USA 120 VAC.  This means that if you try your hair dryer overseas it will work for about 1 second and fail.  This unit has a voltage selector switch so it will work no matter what the voltage is.  Folds to much smaller unit, name branded.  Remember to buy the correct country plug adaptor.
Love love love it. Best one yet.
My boyfriend uses this more than I do.  He seems to enjoy it.
I use it on my curly air.  Works great!
CONS: I took a star away because this is very heavy in hand and awkwardly balanced (and that is without adding the removable tip). The PROS: It came impressively/beautifully packaged, it looks beautiful, feels well made, it has a lot of drying power, and is not too loud.
Awesome dryer! I was on the fence for a while but now I'm addicted. Leaves my fine, fizzy, dry hair soft and smooth and my hair just keeps getting healthier. If you are waiting, don't...you just have to try this once and you will be sold!
I bought this hair blower cause I lost the back of my other blow dryer I must say this has been my favorite blow dryer I have really curly hair and this blow dryer does the job it's very hot so I don't have to spend to much time on one piece of hair every time I do my hair I feel like I just came out the salon
I just love it!
god product
Does not turn off.
It stays true to it's name as it is indeed mini, and I wouldn't buy this if I have thicker hair.
This was for 3 months the Best investment yet for my hair. I have used a cheaper hair dryer forever, but this was worth every penny. However it broke and will not shoot out and warm it hot air. Most disappointing product yet in Amazon I have bought because it worked for awhile so well. I have to purchase a new hair dryer...unfortunately it won't be this one again. As a woman who takes pride in her hair I need something more reliable and safe.
Great hair dryer!  Love having the hair dryer ready to use but out of the way mounted to the wall.  We have one in each bathroom!
Love this hair dryer.  It's louder than I'm used to but my hair seems smoother.
It's a good, no-nonsense hair dryer, and I'm rating it as such.  Three heat settings and two speeds give it great versatility to do a speed dry or more leisurely styling assistance.I'm particularly fond of the removable filter...this is replacing an older hair dryer that was very difficult to clean.  I'm less fond of the attachments...not that they are bad or anything, only that I've never used any kind of attachments for a hair dryer.  They seem a little loose though, so I'm not sure of their ultimate utility.This does put out plenty of power, and it seems like a clean heat without a ton of noise.  It's not whisper-quiet, but it does seem a little more discreet than my old hair dryer.So  I do like this - it's handy with a decent amount of power behind it.  As I said, it's no-nonsense.  And I appreciate it.
My wife loves this thing, she said It feels like a real saloon.
LOVE this hair dryer!
Best dryer I have ever owned.
junk... the diffuser does not fit on the dryer. My whole reason for purchasing this item!
I used this blow dryer for 4 years until it randomly broke one day but it always gave my hair a silky, smooth, and shiny finish (I have straight hair). I would say the noise level is average, not too loud but not whisper quiet either. It has all the heat and speed settings you could need for a blow out and the retractable cord is the best feature because it prevents a dreaded tangled mess.
very nice hair dryer and good price too!
Did not work in Italy
Gets the job done. Downfall is the bonnet connection keeps popping off so you must keep reattaching it.
Good!
Dryer works great but be careful with cord. Last one the cord worked free from dryer and it was shooting sparks out of cord.
Quite  compact. Seems  very  sturdy  High  setting  very  strong  but  quite  loud
It is everything I expected..
works great
Shipment takes a bit long but very good product
I have had alot of hair dryers over the years, i liked this one because it was pink and I could order it on Amazon Prime. However...the highest setting blows more like a medium/low setting which just erks me. If you have thin hair you probably won't mind but if you have thicker hair like myself this is just pain annoying!`
Bought as a replacement for the previous version of this dryer because it finally stopped working after more than 5 years, but I was disappointed when I received it because the power cord is way too short and the power itself is not nearly as strong as the previous model. It'll work for now but I would definitely not buy it again.
This is a nice blow dryer for the price, and it is more lightweight than my trusty Revlon/Helen of Troy model that's still ticking even after numerous drops on my bathroom floor.Like the numerous dial settings, BUT this dryer does not that hot.  But maybe that's to be expected because this is a damage control blow dryer, and heat - along with chemicals like peroxide and ammonia - is one of your hair's biggest enemies.  Have always dried my hair on the lowest heat and speed settings, and the cool shot should be highly distinguishable from a warm setting.  On this hair dryer, you can barely tell them apart.  All heat settings feel relatively the same.The verdict is that, using this dryer, it took a LONGER time to dry my thick hair.  However, my hair did come out nice and shiny.
Not use yet, but I like it.
Woks good
Works very well. I just wish it had a simple on-off switch in addition to a multi-function slide switch. Just a small quibble.
conair always makes good products
Great size and has adequate power...
Small, compact, powerful!
I want you to send me a new one.  After 1.5 years of using this, it blew up on me.  This is the worst hair dryer I have ever bought.  Even my conair hair dryer from 15 years ago still works.  Please contact me to send me a new one.
I really wanted to love this dryer as it comes highly recommended by professional stylists.  I used it twice, it dried my hair quickly and somewhat smooth using a ceramic ion brush.  I was pleased with the results, after all this was a big step up from the half broken one I purchased from Sally's years ago.  Then I visited my mother who recently purchased a new drier, the rusk w8less.  She told me I should try it.  When I used the rusk I was amazed at how fast it dried my hair and how  smooth and silky my hair felt.  I was in LOVE!!! It was a huge step up from the twinturbo.  I had to have the rusk, so I returned the twinturbo.  I could not be happier w the customer service.  Refund was super smooth.  So for the drier 3 stars customer service via Amazon and the seller 5 stars.Pros:  Dries fast, smooth results, nice button position.Cons: Heavy, the wind screen on the back has no cover, just flimsy screen. On both occasions I used the drier my long hair was sucked into the screen, causing it to tangle and burn.  In my opinion this is a design flaw. The hole in the back of the dryer is the circumference of my fist!Look to the rusk w8less!  It's an outstanding dryer!
I bought this hair drier for my girlfriend 3 months ago, expecting it to be great. The attachments do not attach to the drier! It is now useless to her and too late to exchange the product.
The wire mesh over the vacuum in the back wasn't even attached. I had to super glue it down so the blow dryer wouldn't suck hair into the back of it.
It's nice. I thought the cool shot had a locking button, but it doesn't. That was the main reason I bought it. It does work well and it doesn't seem to over heat like me other one.
The fan speed is stable and fast!3 temperature selection is very useful, neither too cold nor too hot for me with short hair~~Highly reommend!
The hair dryer itself is great; but the volumizing finger diffuser is terrible.  The fingers on the attachment are made of rubber and break off.
I just really like this hairdryer.  In fact, I purchased this item to replace the exact same hairdryer, which I had for probably about five years before it finally fizzled out.  It's comfortable to hold, it dries my long, thick hair quickly (no easy feat), and leaves my hair smooth and shiny.  I initially replaced my old hairdryer with a different (more expensive) ionic hairdryer, and didn't get the same results.  So I looked for an exact replacement on Amazon, and was pleasantly surprised to find it, not to mention at such a good price.  Needless to say, I didn't hesitate to click the Buy now with 1-Click button, and I'm glad that I did.PROS:Tourmaline Ceramic technology - emits infrared heat and negative ions, which makes it gentler on hair and faster dryingLightweight, comfortable to hold and useLong cordFoldable - packs and stores easily and compactlyCONS:Doesn't have separate heat and speed settingsThe on/off switch is a little difficult to useDoesn't have a retractable cord
Junk! Highly NOT RECOMENDED! It was broke for a week used!
I'm on the road vacationing and brought this dryer with me. I have very long hair and swim a lot in chlorinated pools. That means a ton of showers and wet hair. This dryer works great for me; it is quiet, efficient and really dries my hair quickly. It sn't so hot that it burns my fine hair. The bonus is that I get a smooth textured outcome that air drying just doesn't give me.On the aesthetic side I love the textured feel to this dryer's exterior. It has a silky matte finish that I very much enjoy. Lovely color as well.
My hairdryer was noisy and past its prime, so I was delighted to try this new Remington dryer. It's sleek and it's quiet. It's a bit heavier than my old Conair, but not so heavy as to be uncomfortable to hold. In fact, it has a very nice, slim grip and I like the matte finish. My hair is indeed shinier, as promised. An unexpected extra is that it stays straighter, a real bonus in heat and humidity. I may never use the attachments (diffuser and focused stream) but it's nice to have them. I'm enjoying my new dryer and look forward to a long relationship.
I love it this dryer is prefect for my daughters and I .
This is a great hair dryer at a fantastic price.  It contains all the elements I have in my older and much more expensive hair dryer.  It uses ionic ceramic toumaline to help reduce frizz and static that occurs from blow drying your hair.  It has three heat settings and two blower speeds.  I generally use the medium heat and the high blower, but I like to have the option to do a quicker dry with high heat when needed.  It also includes the cool shot button which allows you to quickly cool the dryer down in the midst of drying and styling.It has an easily removable filter, which is a huge plus.  I once ruined a dryer because I didn't realize I needed to clean the filter.  Now I periodically take the filter off and blow the wrong way through it to clear dust that accumulates through time.  I do this about one a week or so and it helps keep the dryer running well and from burning out.  I have placed a towel hook next to my bathroom sink and I hang the dryer on it.  It keeps it off the counter, saving room and keeping it within easy reach.The dryer comes with both a concentrator for when you are styling your hair or trying to focus the drying effort as well as a diffuser. The latter is important for me as my hair has a lot of wave and curl and blow drying it without the diffuser turns it all to frizz instead of curls.I'm very pleased with this dryer and recommend it as a good and fairly inexpensive choice.
I already have the D3190A, which is a LOT like this AC215C that I selected for my daughter because she likes this color better than the purple.They both have the cool shot feature which we love, and the cleanable filter (*VERY important feature to keep airflow going strong) which is key to its ability to dry hair quickly, you would think all hair dryers would have it!Now to its features: it has the three heat settings & two power settings (*I wish it had 3 power settings!)It has a concentrator and a diffuser which my daughter who has a head full of natural curls says it is an ESSENTIAL attachment to have if you have curls like her.It also has the ionic (heat protection) technology that keeps your hair free from frizz & fly aways, it dries hair fast we both have long hair & it doesn't tangle it all up when blow drying on high,* ALL of this is just like the purple D3190A model, where it differs is that this one has aFOUR year warranty as opposed to the D3190A, which only has a 2 yr warranty and they say it has a Salon quality AC motor for 4 times a longer lifeso, that explains the longer warranty. For $10.00 more you get a better value as this is supposed to last twice as long as the purple D3190A one that is $20.00They both function excellently, if money is tight get the purple D3190A one, if you have the extra $10 I would go with this one!
This is a very good blow dryer. It has three heat and two speed settings, and a cool shot button to help set your style. It's 1875 watts- so it's nice and strong though not as powerful my professional hair dryer that does dry my hair faster. But my hair has been getting split ends and damaged, so I love that this dryer is designed to protect against heat damage. Only time will tell if that feature works, but I sure need it. This also has the usual attachments that I never use but they look the same as what typically comes with a blow dryer. My biggest problem with blow dryers is the motor dies from not regularly cleaning the lint filter (which draws in dust and causes the motor to overheat). So one great feature is this Remington has a removable filter for easy cleaning, and that will definitely prolong the life of the hair dryer if the filter is cleaned out regularly.My hair comes out smooth and nice with the Remington. My favorite part about the design is it's comfortable to hold, the controls are placed well for comfortable use and most of all it's super lightweight. Also, this dryer is not as loud as most others. It looks great in purple too. I do wish the cord was a little longer. It's long enough for plugging into a high outlet in a bathroom, but if I need to use a lower outlet in another room  then the cord is too short for me to stand and dry my hair (though adequate if I sit down). I'm used to a longer cord, so others may not mind the cord length, but I'm taking one star off as I think the cord should be at least a foot longer. Overall, however, I definitely recommend this hair dryer as it has great features, works very well and is such a great value!
Worked great for about 6 months, then simply would no longer turn on.
haven't gotten to use it yet. Can't get the elastic in the bonnet to open wide enough to get over the rollers. It is a painful attempt even without rollers. I will have to go to JoAnns and get some elastic and rethread the bonnet opening first. So when I finally get to use it I may review with you again.  Did it. Removed the elastic and it works much better. I will still put back in a much longer piece of elastic.
Great quality.
Let me start with the removable filter which allows you to  clean the dust out, my previous dryers did not have this option and the filter would clog diminishing the airflow and the drying ability. That is why this is such an important feature to me,you would think all hair dryers would have it!Now to its features: it has 3 heat settings and 2 power settings (*wish there were 3!) annnd a cool shot which Iove, Love, LOVE! I have very thin, fine hair and when I set my hair with heat rollers I use the cool shot feature to speed up the set and my curls stay in longer as the hair is more cooled down before I take the rollers out so the curls don't fall out as quickly as they used to, my set lasts longer.I use the concentrator but have no need for the diffuser but if you are naturally curly it is a nice attachment to have.It has the heat protection ionic technology that helps keep your hair frizz and fly away free, dries hair fast (I have long hair) and doesn't tangle it up when just doing a blow dry and not setting my curls.It has a 2 year warranty and is at a GREAT price for what you get. I would recommend this dryer.
Love it! Just did not get any papers to register/warrantee on this product.
It's a bit heavy but I LOVE IT! I have curly, frizzy hair and it has helped control it. The price it GREAT too. I can't compare it to a high end dryer but within this price range it's #1.
excelente!!!!
Good.
Needed a new dryer and have been shopping around for a while.  I've looked at this one online a few times but couldn't justify the price.  Then it  went on sale and I jumped on it.  Just got it, first use.  It's not silver, like the one pictured, but I didn't buy it for color so I don't care (mine is kind of a gunmetal black).  Beautifully packaged, easy to understand directions/ switches (and they should be- I'm drying my hair, not launching a rocket into space).  A bit heavier than my last dryer, but not uncomfortable.  I did notice a really mild chemical odor, but I was using the dryer on its highest setting and I'm guessing it had to do with the casing heating up.  The odor did go away and it was never overpowering and didn't make me think the dryer was going to explode in my hand or anything.  The dryer did NOT dry my thick, mid-back length hair in 5 minutes (as was claimed by another reviewer, I think) but it did SIGNIFICANTLY decrease my drying time.  Took about 22 minutes down from 40-50 (and would still have damp spots), and that was with a little extra time fiddling around styling because.....MY HAIR LOOKS AWESOME.  Seriously.  I could be in a hair products commercial right now, I'm not kidding.  I feel like my gorgeous hair is going to waste just sitting inside writing an Amazon review, but this baby deserves it so I sat right down to do it.  I would have NEVER believed a dryer would make so much difference (otherwise I'd have bought this ages ago), but truly, I look like I just walked out of the salon.  I want to stockpile these so I never have to live without it.  This was a phenomenal deal on sale, but I would pay full price (and then some) knowing what I know now.
Loved!!! My hair is dry in less than 5 minutes. The best.
I never realized that spending a little more on a hairdryer could be so worth it. Cut my drying time in half. I've just never even thought of ordering a higher end hair dryer. Glad I finally wised up!
Not as strong as the older built unit with same stock #, name, and specs.
LOVE it. Finally a hairdryer that has powerful air, just the right heat settings, and doesn't break the bank. Three heat settings that feel like they should. Cold. Warm. Hot. Two speed settings, high and low. Very happy with the ease of selecting what I want, plus (again) the great air flow.A major plus is not having the high-pitch screeching whine of a Conair or so many other brands. For such power, the Allure 2200W is a relatively quiet dryer. On a noise scale of 10, I would venture to say between 4 and 6, depending on the settings. For comparison, I would rate most Conairs and probably most other blow dryers I've used at between 7-10. Not dis'ing Conair, just mostly been using that brand for the past decade.My only wish is that the Allure buttons were on the right side (as opposed to facing inside toward your head), as I find the buttons a tad easy to inadvertently press. But that's a personal preference. Maybe you'll like it just the way it is. On the other hand, if you have both left- and right-handed family members, this might be a good solution.Either way, I personally love this dryer. Five stars.
I used one of these in a hotel while on vacation and liked it so much I came home and ordered one.  It works so much faster than my older one.
Great blowdryer for the price that gets the job done. However, the High setting is noisier than I would have liked.
GOOD !!!!
Overall, I like using this dryer, but I have had to get it replaced twice in less than three years. I would not recommend it, as it is not a long-lasting product. My most recent one lasted ten months, and it didn't even get used daily.
professional grade in my home!!
Great hair dryer for the price!
I got this because my old hairdryer was starting to get beat.  I was really surprised at how quickly my hair dried using it.  I have long hair which usually takes a while to dry and literally it took just a few minutes to get it dry.  Really surprising.  And it wasnt superhot either.  I also had more shine, again a surprise.  I dont know how a dryer can shine your hair but it does.  I didnt expect the claims on the box to really be true, particularyl at this dryers price.  A great deal!
I normally do not use a hair dryer but my office now has a gym; after working out I don't want my very long hair dripping all over the place. My hair is straight so I do not need the diffuser attachments that came with this dryer. I was surprised at how quiet this hair dryer is and how much volume of warming air it generates. My hair was dry in minutes. This dryer is light and very efficient. I love the color. Very impressive addition to my hair care regime.
Bought this to take on a trip to Europe.  I love how it folds and how it is easy to convert the voltage.  Most importantly, this small dryer works really well!  Great purchase....BUY IT!
This really works.  I've tried several ceramic, ionic dryers in the past few years and I saw absolutely no difference in how my fine , prone to frizz in humidity hair came out after blowing it dry.  With my new Panasonic, my hair looks smoother, less frizzy and stays that way during the day. For me, this is a keeper!
Light and powerful.  Great for travel.  Dries your hair quickly.
I’m always in search of a hair dryer that can blow dry my thick, curly hair as well as my stylist does. (I know … I know … it’s the person not the tool.) When she dries it, she barely has to touch it up with a flat iron. When I dry it … I have to do a little more work to straighten out the wavy stragglers.This review compares the Revlon 1875W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Dryer, Remington T|Studio Silk AC Professional Hair Dryer, and this one (Remington Damage Control (DC) Ceramic Hair Dryer).All of them have:  * Same wattage  * Three heat settings  * Two speed settings  * Cool shot feature  * Diffuser and concentrator attachments  * Ionic technology  * Ceramic technology  * Hanging loopThe Revlon does not come with a removable filter, the two Remingtons do. (The TStudio doesn’t say it on the box or description. Company website confirms it.) Revlon and Remington Damage Control have tourmaline technology, the TStudio does not.The Revlon’s concentrator attachment stays on. The Remington’s fall off often. If I put the dryer down to adjust my hair, it comes off some of the time. It's hot to put it back on.All three take about the same time to dry my hair. I may have gotten slightly better results (less wavy) with the Remingtons than with the Revlon. I say “may” because the difference wasn’t large enough to be clear. Some days I do a better job than others. Human error, you know.The Damage Control felt like it took less effort and the reason is most likely because it’s the lightest of the three. The shell of the DC and Revlon are plastic while the T|Studio uses better quality materials. But it could be the better quality materials that make it heavier.I can only assume the DC is cheaper than the T|Studio because of its plastic shell even though it has tourmaline technology, which the T|Studio does not.I’ve yet to try the diffusers. Whenever I wear my hair curly, I let it dry naturally. That’s the whole point of going curly – not having to do any hair drying. As for noise – I can’t answer which one is quietest because I’m deaf. It’s not a good idea to wear hearing aids while drying wet hair. :)The winner? The Remington DC because it takes the least amount of effort to use and produces the same results as the others. The T|Studio is just too heavy and the Revlon doesn’t perform as well as the DC.Update November 16, 2015: I downgraded the dryer from 5 stars to 3 stars because the heating element is giving out. It has been getting as hot in the last couple of weeks. When I switched back to an older dryer, I could see a big difference. Lasted only three months.enever I wear my hair curly, I let it dry naturally. That’s the whole point of going curly – not having to do any hair drying.

I have multiple Remington hairdryers and this is my least favorite.  It is loud and heavy to hold.  It actually takes longer to dry my hair than the other ones I own.  Love the color, but thats about it.  The other two Remington hair dryers I own have added benefits of smoothing or taming frizz, etc... this one doesn't do any of that... it's just a normal, no thrills hair dryer and takes almost twice as long to dry my hair on the highest, hottest setting :(  The motor doesn't seem as strong in this one.  Would not purchase in the future.
Love this dryer!!!! Hair dries quicker and is so convenient to travel with!
A hair dryer is not something I generally replace until I need it.  Mine is still working,  but I had been saying for a while that I needed a new one.  I've always just looked at it as something that blows air and that they are all pretty much the same.  After using this one a few times,  I will never say that again.  This hair dryer is awesome.  I had already switched my curling irons to ionic ceramic and could tell a big difference,  but I didn't realize that it would also make a difference in a hair dryer.  Not only does it dry my hair faster,  but it leaves it looking much more healthy.  I have very long hair and even though I take good care of it,  I had noticed that it was looking dull and dry.  The first time I used this dryer,  I could tell a difference.  I don't know all the how or why reasons,  but I do know that my hair didn't look or feel like all the moisture had been stripped from it.  I had even started to air dry my hair because I could see what was happening to it,  but that takes a long time with thick , long hair.  I will still air dry when I have the time,  but now I feel like I can dry my hair quickly (and this dryer does it VERY quick),  and not be damaging it.  I don't use the high heat on this one because it's very hot and my fine hair wouldn't like that,  but I like knowing that the option is there if needed.  The air flow with this is massive.....really powerful... When on high,  I can dry my hair in a few minutes,  but that's only when I'm just drying it to put in a ponytail.  Medium is more than enough airflow to dry and style it, and I love the cool setting.  When I used a round brush to curl,  I finished with the cool setting and it made all the difference.  It's not a small dryer,  but it's not at all heavy ,  especially considering the power that it contains.  They include a little card explaining that their products are made by women.  I find that reassuring, since most men that I know don't really use one,  therefore,  how could they know what we need.  They also donate a portion of their profits to charities that benefit women.  Between that and the fact that you get such a high end, quality made product  for such a reasonable price,  I  am totally sold on this company.  You can tell that they care about their products.  I highly recommend it.  I can't imagine anyone not loving it.I did receive this product free for the purpose of testing and reviewing with my honest opinion,  and I couldn't be happier to tell you how wonderful this dryer is.efore,  how could they know what we need.

Got this for my mom. It is a bit heavier than she'd like but overall she loves it!
Great...exactly what I expected
Needed to get a less powerful blow dryer when I moved to a place with crappy outlets that were killing my other dryers. The MiniPro is super tiny and looks like it could be for a doll, but surprisingly works great for me. Made well and feels sturdy. My dry time seems to be shorter. I have fine hair though. My stepdaughter has long medium hair and it dried her pretty quick as well. Love the color. Very light weight and will be perfect for travel. Especially love the travel bag it comes with, so cute! Been using this dryer a few weeks now and no complaints. Only wish is that it had a cool setting.
Quiet, excellent drying, doesn't get dangerously hot.
Really enjoying this dryer. Works really well for my curly hair. I had a really nice/pricey dryer, similar to this one, for years and when it gave out I bought a dept store $30 dryer. I noticed immediately that my hair was getting frizzy. I used that for several months and then finally decided to break down and shell out the cash for this dryer. So glad that I did.I mostly use it with the curl diffuser on warm heat. I get great curls and less frizz. On occasion I use the directional attachment to straighten my bangs or all of my hair and I love that too. Makes my hair silky smooth.The last time I bathed my dog I used the other nozzle that is supposed to be quick dry. That was really amazing. Dried my little dog in no time. I was happy and she seemed to be relieved. I imagine that if you don't need to worry about frizz, this quick dry nozzle would be great if you're in a hurry.I've had this for several weeks and I would recommend it. Hoping this one lasts quite a while!
Nice little unit but it will fry your body parts if you're not careful.  Very powerful.
This thing is awesome!! Small, compact, powerful. This thing stores well as it folds up, for those of us that have limited bathroom space and cabinets or travel often. Conair has been making quality products for years and they have always been affordable.
It's ok for the price.The plastic feels cheap, the sliding button occasionally is difficult to move and when removing the difusser, i feel as i may break it. The plug isn't the most secure either, seeming to fit loosely in the socket. Despite this, it gets hot enough for my needs and hasn't failed me yet after about 6 months of use. If you need a cheap blow dryer this is a great pick.
We have bought at least 6 of these....and they all inexplicably die within a matter of one year!!  I should have stopped ordering replacements, lazy on our part so we could just use the same wall mounts.  Time to try another brand!!!
Was a great dryer. Loved it. However it burned out within 2 months.
I received this item as a test product for the VINE review program, but this is a great hair dryer for a low price. it has 1875 watts, which is 25 more than most, and more ion presentation for quicker hair drying. Ions are funny things Ionized air respells water, and deionized water falls off easier, so if there was a way you could wash your hair in DI water, you would really have it made, cleaner hair that dries very fast, but I digress. This dryer does the job of a much more expensive professional dryer, it is a good buy!
Great
I was afraid that this hair dryer would not be top quality because of the price. However, everything about it seems great.
I've only had this for about six months and it's goes off and on while I'm using it. Then today after the dryer had been off for over an hour it started humming as if it were &quot;stuck&quot; on. Can't return because it doesn't fall withing amazons return time!!! NOT NOT NOT HAPPY... DO NOT BUY!!!!!
I like the dryer - I know this will sound silly but the color in the picture is the reason I chose this one but it is not HOT pink as it looks in the picture it is more like a Peto Bismol color. Other than that it is fine.
This dryer leaves my hair shiny and soft, has good variety of settings, and that necessary cool shot of air to set my hair for the day. Highly recommend! Can't beat the price point.
Love this! GREAT Power, adjustable speeds, works awesome!
excelente
Love it!!
Nothing to complaint about its functions.  However, it is way too heavy to hold for more than a few minutes.  Fine for my short hair, but not for my daughter's long hair.
Best cheap hair dryer ever
Love this blow dryer!
Was for my mother who has always used one.  It worked wonderfully for her.  She liked the settings for heat control.  That was a big concern for her.
Works very good for the price but WOW it is very heavy and takes time to get use to
perfect dryer
For the price (and based on other reviewers), I was expecting a lot more.  I have very long, thick hair and the Sedu Revolution does dry my hair faster (cut about 10 minutes off drying time); however, it actually makes my hair more frizzy!  Not good!!  The hair dryer is also heavy and loud!!!  Based on the packaging, it looks like I received a previously used blow dryer that someone else returned.  I would never recommend this blow dryer to anyone!
Great blow dry . shiny hair and fast blow dry
Awesome dryer, I have been looking for something like this for quite sometime!
I love that this has 3 different heat settings. Cuts drying time in half without using too much heat. If i had to have one complaint, the dryer itself is a little heavy, other than that it's perfect.
Sleek, comfortable to hold, works great. So happy that I purchased this item.
Great, lightweight, use every day for past year almost & love it!! Best price too!
Cheap and comfortable, defenetly worth it
It stopped working today after working wonderfully for a few months
This is a nice basic hairdryer. We have a big family and own several Remington hairdryers. This one is in the kids bathroom. With its smaller grip it's a good size for older kids and teens to use. It dries hair fairly quickly, on par with most other dryers we've owned. We keep it on a command adhesive hook above the outlet to the side of the sinks. The cord has a good sized built in loop for hanging.I was really happy to find that it comes with both a wide, flat nozzle for straightening as well as a diffuser for curly styles. My fancy high end dryer didn't come with a diffuser and it took forever to find one that fit. I also like that it has a cool button, no need to slide a button up and down to set a style with cool air.My one complaint is that this dryer is a bit noisier than the other Remington dryers we have. It's not so noisy that it consider it loud for a hairdryer but if you're searching for a quiet model know this one is average to slightly above average as far as noise goes.All in all I'm impressed with this hairdryer. It's a fantastic value at this price point. All our other Remington's have lasted years.
It has a good quality, I remember my daughter always on a hurry and sometimes drops this dryer on the floor and its still on one piece, that is so great, it didn't break easily
Delivery was fast, within a week. The first time using it I noticed that on all 3 settings the air is just warm, doesn't get very hot, which I thought wasn't that big of a deal considering my hair is bleached and I shouldn't be putting a lot of heat on it anyway. The second time I used it the high setting just didn't work, I switched it from medium to high and it just turned off when on the high setting. I had already thrown out the packaging at this point so since it was only like $13 I didn't feel like it was really even worth it to try to return.
amazing dryer !! it makes my hair soft and easy dry. Even though the price is expensive but I really recommend this product to others ! i like pink color very pretty. very useful !!!!
I really do like it! It is so handy and drys my hair very good. I would recommend it to anyone that needs a hair dryer.
my wife love it, its not heavi and powerfull
I mean it works well. I just wish they'd label this as PINK AND BROWN.
Excellent product, and dries my long thick hair very fast.
Works excellent. Light weight also which I like very much.
This is a decent hair dryer, and we usually buy the less expensive ones because they seem to last as long, if not longer, than more expensive ones.  On this one, the handle doesn't fold, which is kind of a pain for storing, and it only has two heat settings, which my wife found to be either too hot and not hot enough, so she went back to her old one.  The removable filter is a simple plastic screen that screws off of the back so it can be washed.  It's nothing special, but it's a nice touch that you can remove it vs. trying to get all the gunk out while wrangling the rest of the dryer.  We don't use the attachments for curly hair, so while they were included and seem durable, we'd not be able to say how well they work.  At any rate, it's a good dryer we'll keep in the guest bathroom and can serve as a functional backup.
Bought this as a damaged box item. It was in perfect condition. It is a professional hairdryer so keep in mind it is solid & somewhat heavier than your basic, cheap home brand.
The accent parts are pink..a light princess pink...something that is not totally obvious on a mobile screen. Not a big deal, but I would prefer white or black. Hair dryer has a good weight to it and it feels solidly built. Hot/cold function works fine. I would like a bit more volume to the air, something that all newer hair driers seem to lack. I have one from 1991 that is like a tornado on its highest setting.
Everything about this hairdryer seems nice, except for the power. It is so weak. I do have thick hair but have another Conair that is much more powerful.I would have returned this, but was able to swap with a friend who has thin hair.
Very good
It gets the job done!
Small light and powerful.  I love this hair dryer.
Dries my fine curly hair quickly. Good price, too.
great blowdryer !! i looked up for reviews before i purchased and i could not be happier! Drys really fast and its very hot!!!
Found this gem in a hotel in Savannah and liked it so much I took a photo and found it on Amazon.  Bought two, one for each bathroom.
Excelente
Awesome
Works great! It's so cute! Wonderfully small and pretty hot pink color. It does the job! I have fine hair and this dryer doesn't overpower me or my hair. Nice and lightweight. You might think, oh, this little thing isn't going to do anything, but it DOES! Highly recommended for fine hair.
Bought this for my girlfriend, she loves it. Can't give it a 5 because she doesn't believe in them, and I haven't used it for myself seeing how my hair is nearly to my scalp haha.
Worked in Middle East
Love these
Fast shipping has lots of power my friend recommended this blower she loves it so I am very excited to use mine
Used once - recently cut hair - Sure to use it again after hot weather ends.
Did not work, return policy do not allows you to return. this product was defective, sucks I can not return it. Save your bucks and do not buy it!
I am very pleased with this hair dryer. It is powerful, quiet and dries my hair in less time than previous dryers.I have the Elchim for European current and thought it worked so well that I decided to buy one that uses US current.I  highly recommend this Elchim product!
The best hair dryer ever!  We traveled to NYC over the summer.  At the Seton Hotel, these were the hair dryers they had for guests to use.  My hair was not dry.  It had a variety of settings and was not noisy.  I came home immediately an ordered one.  Wen shampoo and this hair dryer word well together.  :)
Unfortunately, the heat element went out in my dryer less than one year into owning it.  The product is light and quieter than most dryers I have owned.  Definitely made my hair softer.  Still would recommend.
I like the hair dryer
I have 3B curly hair and the diffuser attachment works amazing, it doesn't make my hair frizzy but provides a lift to my roots. The dryer is super lightweight and is very quite. I keep it on low and the power is still amazing, it cut my hair routine by half. I would highly recommend this to anyone with 3B curly hair.
I bought this in March and by July it stopped blowing hot air. It's such a shame because it was a really great hair dryer when it was working. I noticed other reviewers have said the same thing, which makes me think it's a flaw in the design.
Excellent hair dryer, but my impression is that the controls could be a little more ergonomic.  Quieter than most hair dryers, I particularly like the small rubber nubs on the side which help keep it on your counter.  3 fan settings and 2 heat settings (3 if you include heat off) plus a Cool shot button.
Please don't buy this. I used this for just 3 or 4 times and now started getting coil burning smell when I turn it on. It should go to trash now.
I like the looks of these and have purchased a number of them for the rentals I manage as they mount on the wall. Out of about six I've bought, I have had one that I purchased in May 2015 to quit working, although it's had very little use. But, I am replacing it with the same type.
Too Heavy.
I am quite a fan of Remington hair dryers and while my old one is still quite functional, I prefer the newer Remington AC2015C T|Studio Silk AC Professional Hair Dryer.  The newer model has basically the exact same functions as my older, far more expensive model; 1875-watt motor, two attachments, the heat settings, three speeds, and a cold air setting.  The newer Remington AC2015C is heavier, which I actually prefer, the attachments are about 50% smaller, another bonus for me, as I already have straight, thin hair, and the other attachments were too much attachment for my needs.  This ceramic model has a coating that I like; it keeps my hands from slipping.  The control buttons are still on the underside of the handle, which I prefer, as it is easier to adjust, in my opinion.  This model appears to dry my hair faster than my older, more expensive model, and both offer a smooth, frizz free finish.  I would highly recommend this hair dryer, it does what it says it does and the price is fantastic.
Good use. It's very compact. Make sure to buy plug head adapters because it is dual voltage use but you still need head adapters to fit the sockets abroad.
Dryer was delivered on time.  It is powerful, dries my short hair in 2 minutes and isn't heavy.  Love it.
It arrived within 2-3 days and works perfectly. I have thick, frizzy, curly hair and never have been able to blow dry it because it gets so much poofier. However, with the diffuser this blow dryer made my curls shiny and soft, no frizz or poof, I'm in love!
very nice
Hard to find a small, lightweight travel dryer that we use everyday. Works great and very portable when we travel in our RV. Would buy again.
The hair dryer is fine if you don't need to change the voltage, but I bought it for international traveling, and it's a big con for me that the switch doesn't turn to 250 volts. It looks as though it can easily turn with a coin. Do not be fooled. It's impossible to turn the switch to 250 volts. I stripped the switch bare trying to turn the damn thing. I can barely see where the arrow is, which points to which voltage setting it's at. Luckily for me (sarcasm), mine is permanently at 125 volts. Maybe mine was faulty, but I was definitely not happy with this product. Would not recommend to a friend. Two stars only because the hair dryer itself works fine and because it's cheap.
Excelent
The hair dryer is great. Multiple hear and speed options. I would have given it five stars except for that fact that the funnel tip does pop off too easily if bumped by a brush.
Excellent hairdryer, folds up nicely, haven't had the opportunity to test it on 240V yet, but I'm sure it'll do just fine. Turning the dial on the handle locks you out of putting it on the high setting whenever you're using it with 240V, which is a really user-friendly addition. (You're not suppose to use it on high with 240V according to the manual.)
works great, no need to purchase a hairdryer with a price tag higher than this...
It will seriously dim the lights in your house, but man can it dry hair!
This item is great!Great price and the best thing I like is that I'll be able to use it any where in the world. Thanks much
Nice dryer and very handy wall mount.
The hair dryer had great power and dried my hair really fast; however, it caught fire in less than a month.  I had to send it back.
Bought this for my girlfriend. She loves it!
Dryer works very well for ,me!
This hair drier is great, mostly because it is much quieter than most others. This is a big plus, especially for shared bathrooms. It comes with a couple adapter pieces that either diffuse the air or focus it, depending on what your hair is like. It is clearly very nice quality. The only thin that would be nice is a retractable cord, but that is a small quibble. Highly recommended!
I have ordered this hair dryer less than a year ago and it is already broken.  The retractable cord stopped fully retracting after about 4 months. After 11 months, the high and medium settings quit working and only low is still operational. I expect a hair dryer to last more than a year.
Im a dude first off. At first I thought it was real heavy then I got used to it however this is my first hair dryer as I am growing my hair longer. Ladies beware of the weight however it drys my hair very quickly its about 4 in all the way around right now and takes about 30sec tops completely dry. When you buy it there is multiple settings you just have to play with the two switches that flip up and down. NOT PICTURED IT COMES WITH A FUNNEL AND THE FUNNEL WITH THE COMB ON BOTH SIDES!!!!!!!!Im 1 for 1Take my advice at your own risk.
This is a very nice hair dryer that does the job well.  I have medium length hair and the dryer dried it quickly.  I hate to dry my hair, so that is a big plus factor for me.  It's comfortable to hold, not too heavy.  Controls are easy to use.  I didn't need the do anything fancy, so I used it as I do every other hair dryer.  The box says it's professional, used in salons.  Hair dressers could comment more on the differences between dryers.  I'm not too picky about it as long as it isn't uncomfortable to use and works well. This one is just fine for me.  I'd recommend.
Best light weight powerful hair dryer i have ever owned.
This is a sturdy, powerful hair dryer.  My stylist recommended it and it DOES NOT disappoint!!
I have had this hair dryer for just over a year - 379 days to be exact and this morning when I went to turn it on, no dice. Dead. I have had ConAir hair dryers that have cost $20 last longer than this one,so to say I'm unhappy is an understatement! I don't even use it everyday- maybe 3 times per week AND last summer, I left it while I traveled for over 2 months, so the life of this this thing was seriously short. BEWARE~
We like this little beast around here, I have short thick somewhat unruly hair, my daughter has long curly naughty at times hair. It works well for both of us. It got the job done fast with out being uncomfortably hot and feeling very heavy. That's not to say its very small or it would not make the best grab and go pack it up dryer, but its no cumbersome either. It left out hair very manageable, love the two extensions and option for different heat and speed settings. Remington makes quality items for a fair price. We like it.
This is an extra dryer we use upstairs after the kids take their baths.Ergonomics is good and you don't accidentally press any buttons while holding it at various angles.  The fan speeds are powerful and the different heat settings are definitely appreciated.  Also, it has the typical cool-shot button.It comes with a blade-diverter attachment as well as a volumizer attachment.The length of the cord is reasonable even with a 1-yr old running around.The weight and feel are good as well as it has a high-quality feel to it, perhaps the ceramic coating or so, doesn't feel plastic-y at all.  We would definitely recommend this to any household from little toddlers to adults.
I really like this product.  It's compact, but powerful, and pretty lightweight.  Does a good job drying my fine hair (I've fine hair, but a lot of it) in scant minutes.  The only thing it isn't, is quiet, but they don't advertise it as such- just pointing it out though.  I'm very pleased with it.
When I first received this I absolutely loved it.  Great power, the cord was sturdy and extra long, and it worked really well.  However, I am returning it for a refund, because one month after getting it, the hi - lo switch stopped working and it would only work on high.  I thought I could live with that but this morning when I was using it the switch in the handle started feeling really hot and smoke started coming out of it.  So I don't know if it was just a fluke and this particular one was defective, or if it is something that happens often with this model.  I was really disappointed though because I was really pleased with it when it was working as it was supposed to.
With the exception of colors, this appears to be the same as an earlier model of the same brand I owned.  That was reliable for several years until slowing speed required replacement.
It works pretty good for the money...
Terrible blowdryer. Scary to use as it sparks.
Tried and true.  My last Conair lasted 15 years.  I was so glad to see the style was still available.  Compact, but has power.
This hair dryer was out of stock for more than 2 months. I even tried xtava.com to buy this hair dryer but to no avail. I contacted their customer service but they just asked me to wait so I waited and waited. I didn't want to buy any other hair dryer. I just had to have this hair dryer because of its 2200W power and nice design. Consequently, I ended up having to endure the life of no hair dryer for nearly 3 months. But, after using this hair dryer today for the first time. I absolutely do not regret the long wait.
The hairdryer blows air very softly if that's such a thing.  Needs more power, I feel like it takes longer to dry my hair.
Birthday present for the wife after she used one at a hotel. Drys in half the time and stores easily.
This dryer is lightweight, yet has a quality feel to it.  It fits your hand well, has nice adjustability, an dries your hair well without over-drying it.I think the price is quite reasonable too.  Seems like a product that will last, and of course it's not a no name product, but a Remington, so presumably the quality is there.A nice dryer at a nice price.  5 stars.
My old one broke down after only about 20 years of hard work. I got a new one and was pleased to find the design was the same. Why get off a winner. Works well and easy to pack.
Works good for me, no problems and I use it damn near everyday
Does the job,but not what I expected.
Works great in my cottage up north.Recommended to hotel & motel owners who want a secure way to provide a hairdryer to guests, without losing it.
My girls say this works great.  Much better than their old one.  Dries hair fast!
Love the product. Very fast shipping.
I really like this product. The cord seems to be way longer than what I am used to. I really like the tools it comes with...
Good functionality but Too heavy!
Installation was difficult.  A small plastic piece cracked during installation, which caused us to have to install a different way.  I wish the hair dryer carrier was smaller.
I have both straight and curly hair (blow dryer + round brush, straight. A little curl spray & diffuser, curly), so I've owned tons of blow dryers. This diffuser is great. I diffuse with my hair upside-down & it gives me big full curls. Others have said their long hair has gotten stuck in it & that hasn't been  the case for me. Only reason I gave it 4 stars & not 5 is because it's larger & heavier than I expected.
Love this dryer! I noticed a big difference after using just once. Hair felt healthier!
've been through three hair dryers in the past year. One of them broke after a short fall from my hand to the bathroom counter (seriously??), the second one always got too hot and stunk up my bathroom, even on the lowest hear setting (grrrr...) And then there was the Onei.The Onei is just perfect! I really like that is has an ion activation switch in the handle. When you turn on the dryer, you can hear it speed and warm up - there isn't that sudden blast of metal smelling heat like the cheaper dryers I've owned. I definitely recommend the Onei to anyone who wants a quality dryer.
Perfect & light weight.
The cap is very small and tight. I had to take it off after 10 mins.
The string is too tight around the head. I wish they would bring back the gold bonnet one back. I had to settle for this one because I couldn't find that other one. But I'm not a real fan of this BUT it still gets the job done.
Within less than four months, I noticed a fiery red glow within the barrel and had to stop using for fear of my hair catching on fire.  The company was nice enough to refund my money once I could finally get hold of someone (note there are no phone numbers provided with the dryer or on their website), however I do not recommend due to safety issues.
Excellent product! Excellent customer service.
Problems using with uk adaptor
Good
The hose and bonnet  does not  stay connected  . It needs to have  way to lock it in place.
I've had 3 of these hair druers and was happy with them because of the folding feature. The last one I purchased through Amazon stopped heating correctly within 2 weeks of use. Thats just poor....
Meh, it just doesn't work that well for me.  I think the diffuser needs to be smaller and curved more to better fit the shape of a person's head.  Somehow my wavy curls end up being too smooshed flat against my head, then sticking out toward the ends.  Not a fan, wish i hadn't tossed the box.
It was ordered for a friend whose wife runs a beauty shop and he says it working fine
This blow dryer arrived compliments of the Vine program.  It is supposed to dry hair quickly and with minimal frizz and damage.  I found the drying time to be the same if not slower than my Conair 1875 blow dryer.  The rocker buttons are in an awkward thumb position and get in the way of a smooth grip on the handle.  Top it off with a very bulky and weighted feel and you have a dryer that is not suitable for our preference.
Solidly built hair dryer - diffuser stays on and doesn't pop off on a moment's notice as did a Revlon drier I used to have but which fell apart in less than a year... (am returing to Bed Bath Beyond) nice built in hook for hanging, plenty powerful, not too noisy, price was OK. All in all, works better than a towell and/or shaking the head a lot to remove water!  haha
The retractable cord rarely fully retracts and it doesn't seem to get as hot as other hair dryers I have had in the past
In the past year I have stopped blow drying my hair straight, opting to let my curls be free. I love that this dryer has a diffuser attachment. Most hair dryers only come with the concentrator attachment. My curls, which have really improved since quitting straightening,now take forever to dry, since my hair is not dried out, anymore. I can use this on my curls to dry them quickly, since I hate leaving the house with wet hair. The diffuser works well, not frizzing my hair at all and my curls are bouncier than when they air dry. That's a great plus. I only need about 5 minutes of drying time to achieve 95% dry hair. It has a cool shot and also a high/low feature. This dryer gets very hot, so I dry my curls on the medium setting, which is still hot. The higher setting would be better for straightening.
I have owned this product. It lasted 3 years. The fan blades shattered into pieces.  I chose to replace it with the same unit. That translates into $10 /yr.  Prior to the Oster I had Sunbeams. One lasted 8 years. They are no longer available. There cost was 2/3'rds the cost of the Oster. Where are the economical competitors? Functionally, the latest Oster is much improved regarding sound. In fact it is whisper quiet by comparison. Overall, the product is very nice in display and function.
Best blow dryer ever for my wild curls. I used to have to live the house with wet hair and hope for the best - not anymore! The speed and heat settings make it super easy to tame the frizz.
I bought this at a local store and it was fine for a while (other than the fact that the off/low/high switch was difficult to move), but then one day turned it on and I noticed it didn't sound as loud and found that it wasn't heating up at all and there was just a bit of cool air blowing out.  This was less than six months after purchasing.
I love the price
like it
I had this one for over 3 years and it worked great.  It just recently died and I bought the exact same model.  The retractable cord is so nice!
I rarely use a hair dryer to dry my hair but lately, I am tired of waiting for it to air dry.  When that happens, I use my handy dandy John Frieda Full Volume Hairy Dryer.  When I was offered the opportunity to try this product, I quickly accepted.  I received a sample product to review in exchange for my honest opinion.  I actually received this product almost 2 years ago.  I use it when I want my hair dried quickly.The John Frieda Full Volume Dryer features frizz-fighting technology, 3 heat and two speed settings. I can add volume and shine to my hair with just a few minutes of use.My hair takes just a few minutes to dry. The hair dryer is very lightweight in my hands, so it doesn’t take a lot to blow dry my hair.  I use the cool setting most of the time since I don't like to use heat on my hair.  The cool setting comes in handy in the summer time.  Who wants to blow hot air on their hair in the dead of summer?The John Frieda Full Volume Dryer comes with 3 attachments, but I choose to use the dryer without any attachments. I just want to dry my hair, so I don’t bother with the attachments.  I received a sample product to review in exchange for my honest opinion.
Very good for the hair and face.
Excellent
******update, 3 years and goin strong, good product   Original review -   Been over a year, love this thing, has different heat settings and attachments, is yeah and it's cute to boot
I've had my wall mounted Oster for over 20 years.  It is starting to smell so I am now looking for a new one.  I only had to clean it once.  Mine only has 1200  watts, but I have always had short hair so that may have made a difference for the long length of time I've owned it.  But I have loved it since I bought it and I use it every day since I wash my hair  when I shower every morning before leaving for work.
I use this on my dog after I give her a bath. Great
The drying speed is actually no faster than my $20 1350W hair dryer. The quick dry head dries even slower than the precise dry head. And in my opinion the dryer is HEAVY. But my hair does feel much smoother than before. It does its job to retain the moisture of my hair.
This is the second blower I've owned! I almost went for the newer style...so glad I didn't! I just love this model and I don't think I'll ever look to change! It's a great, reliable blower and the power behind this puppy is awesome! I tend to have frizzy hair, so I need a good blower to smooth it out! This is the perfect choice to remedy this hair type! :-)
excellent product, what I asked was what got me
I just signed in to find when I ordered this and it was last October. It has worked fine until it began having little sparks in last couple of days internally. Would not recommend this because of that hazard and only getting less than 1 year out of it.
Great hair dryer. It is less noisy that my other hair dryer. Beautiful finish!!!
really good to use
I bought this keeping in mind that the cool shot button may not work after reading a review. I blow dry my hair at most 3 times for the year so for me it does the job. I use the cool setting which still feels a little warm to me but it helps to stretch my hair very well but without the heat damage (I still use heat protectant though). But.. the cool shot button DEFINITELY DOESN'T WORK
Fine product wish I had one years ago.
This item is pink and it is not clearly advertised as such.
I've been using this for a few months now and I..... love it ^_^ ! Its does a great job, I always use the cool setting and you know what it stays cool. Unlike other dryers that you have to keep holding a button, this one has a low temp setting that remain moderately temperature. The burst of cool air button gets even cooler. Thats what I really like about this dryer along with the slim design is very cool. Okay enough with the cool XD Its a great product, you won't be disappointed.
Love this hair dryer. For years, I had a terrible old dryer that wouldn't die. When it finally did, I was worried that anything new I got would be junky like so many electronics these days. I have had this hair dryer for about a year now and still love it as much as I did the day I got it. It dries really fast without being too hot to damage my hair. It has a satiny finish that feels nice in your hand too.
My hair dryer broke and I needed a replacement.  I keep my hair dryer plugged in by my sink and I worried about my grandkids accidentally dropping it in the sink so I bought this wall mounted unit.  I absolutely love it.  So convenient and it's more powerful than my old hair dryer.  I may get another one for the other bathroom.
I've had this blow dryer for a year or so and I love it. I haven't had to replace it
I really like this hair dryer. It dries my hair quickly & thoroughly, even though just a little heavy. Excellent product & highly recommended
I like it.
Ordered this and upon arrival the dryer stopped working. It would turn on and work for a few seconds and then overheat. Not pleased with this purchase. I have used similar Andis dryers in the past without problem, this one was a dud.
great buy
THIS DRYER IS THE BEST I've used for my very curly hair. I DRY MY HAIR SECTION AT A TIME BY HOLDING THE DRYER CLOSE TO THE SCALP, AND SQUISHING THE HAIR INTO THE DIFFUSER. AFTER ABOUT 6 minutes my hair is completely dry. THEN I MASSAGE MY SCALP BUT I NEVER PUT MY HANDS THROUGH THE ENDS. IT IS CALLED THE PIXIE METHOD OF DRYING. I NEVER HAVE A BAD HAIR DAY ANYMORE.
After my $60+ salon brand hair dryer crapped out on me after like 4 months, I decided to just look for a hair dryer with a great price. I did not even realize that it's a conditioning dryer and now my hair never looked better! My old dryer made my hair look dry and unhealthy and I can't believe how much better it looks now. I love it!! It doesn't get super hot but dries my long thick hair fast and fluffy. I've had it for a little over a year now and it is still working great.
I love it for its practicality and efficiency.  It is quiet all right.
Does what it's supposed to.
Shipment was received in short time.Hair dryers are easy to installed
Love this product.
Exactly what I expected
Love this blow dryer. For those of you who have curly hair and have issues with bigger dyers, this is the one for you!
Blows hot air aroundBut now we really want itHope it doesn't melt
Cord retract is a bitch to work.  Have to screw with it to get it to take it all in.
The brush is way too soft. It doesn't make it through my hair, wet or dry. Had to send it back.
so easy to install, so sturdy. I love it!
Dries my hair in no time, a really great investment! love it!
Great dryer,  works extremely well,,,,  love the automatic rewind.... works great, just follow the directions.....Very satisfied with this dryer.
I am 58 years old and have mid-length, medium texture, slightly wavy hair.For the past 15 years I have been using the same Conair hairdryer (it just will not die) an average of 2-3x a week and over that time have had my share of good hair days and bad.Recently, I've noticed that my hair has been getting very dry - even in the summer which is very unusual.So, after trying various shampoos with not much difference, I decided to Google 'dry hair' and low and behold, hair dryers popped up! I don't think I would have come up with that on my own, so of course I then started researching hair dryers. There are about as many 'Top Ten Hair Dryer' lists as I think there are hair dryers! While there are a couple of (pricey) brands that tend to show up on most of those lists, I finally decided to look at it a different way ie: what 'technologies' exist and what would work best with my hair. I like a lot of volume and smoothness, so ionic, ceramic, tourmaline with infra red seemed to fit the bill - which is everything this dryer has. I read pretty much all of the reviews, watched the YouTube videos and even tho' people complained about the weight and button positions, I decided to give it a try. Well, I have to say that I am literally blown away! First, I understand why people complain about the button position as the first time I used it, I also kept changing speed and heat settings. However, it took me no time at all to figure out how to hold it so that doesn't happen. The heat levels are nice and consistent and the Cool Shot button works great - doesn't 'lock' but I don't care as I just shoot the roots before I finish each section so works fine for me. Regarding the weight, that was the only thing that I was a bit concerned about at first, since my old dryer was super light.  Now, after using it for the second time, I didn't even notice the weight, only the incredibly awesome results it produces! I actually feel like I have new hair as it is no longer dry and frizzy but instead is super smooth, soft and bouncy. I still can't believe changing hair dryers could make such a difference. I actually look forward to doing my hair now! My recommendation is, do your research, but if you have hair similar to mine, give this fantastic dryer a try - I don't think you'll be disappointed!frizzy but instead is super smooth, soft and bouncy.

Too bulky.
Great for the price! Strong and powerful!
Best blow dryer I have ever owned! My 4C hair gets pretty straight using this not even on the high setting!
works great.......light enough to be comfortable.
Working excellence.
Excellent!
Arrived right on time, performs very well, is quieter than expected and is compact for traveling
I don't know what all the fuss is about. However I'm not going to stand there with this thing stuck to my head to try to dry my hair. I found it so much easier and less fuzzier to apply product and let the hair dry on its own than to stand and let this dryer do its thing. A complete waste of money on my end.
This blow dryer works great for travel. It is small, lightweight and is very easy to convert for various power needs as I traveled from country to country on a recent trip. My only very small complaint would be that it is very loud to operate.
No problems with it. Works for me!
Awesome Power, Just A Little Heavy!!
This is a really good dryer. I have had it for five months, and it works well. I wish it was higher powered, but I wouldn't return it!
Compact, easy to travel with.  Puts out plenty of air.  Works very well.
I bought this hair dryer in March based on Amazon reviews. It worked ok at the  beginning but now no longer has any air pressure and takes at least 2x as long to dry my hair. The return period for this product is one month and now I need to purchase another new hair dryer. Very displeased with this purchase.
good unit . a little pricey but i was replacing a 7 or 8 year old like unit so i did not want to change unit or mounting system.
Low setting is to strong and to fast also the dryer is too heavy
Not as powerful as some.this size.  Easy to mount to wall.  It does have a bright night light.
I bought this dryer for my girlfriend for her birthday last year because she is always complaining about getting her hair done and how much people charge her (which I end up paying for anyway) so I thought what better thing to buy her for her birthday than something she can use and benefit from forever. She loves this hair dryer, she puts her hair in rollers and sits under. It gets very hot too! Thanks for the great buy!
Thank you
Just a really nice hair dryer for the money.
[[VIDEOID:3ce786db72a405f72c6e511ec156f72d]]I have needed a hair dryer forever and finally got this one. I am so happy because the vent on my old one was sucking my hair inside and I would have to break by hair to get it out.This hairdryer is very nice and durably constructed. It feels substantial in my hands, not flimsy and cheap. It comes with 2 diffuser type attachments that connects easily and stay in place until you take them off.The cord on this hairdryer is super long so I can move around quite a bit while drying my hair. There is also a loop built in the handle so this hair dryer can be hung up for storage purposes.The hairdryer itself has a cool shot button which you hold down if you want cool air to blow out. There is another button that changes the forcefulness of the air that is blowing out (this one has 2 settings). The last button is high, medium and low for the warmth of the heat that will blow out of the hair dryer.This hair dryer is 1875 watts so it is pretty powerful and it dries my hair pretty quickly. The infrared light actually is an orange red color and it helps to reduce static and frizz.I am very impressed with this hair dryer and I wish I would have gotten it sooner.I received this product free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
Used one in a hotel and replaced my huge home dryer.
Does a great job and meets all my expectations for heat and air.
Doesn't retract. Very cheaply made. I returned the prodcut.
This blow dryer is hot and powerful.  Dries my hair super fast, like 2 minutes fast!  This is by far the nicest blow dryer I have ever owned.
Excellent product. Worked as advertised, powerful and light.
Comb breaks easily, a little hard to old without touching all the buttons.
I've had this for a couple years. It's been very good. The cord is a little short. Otherwise, no complaints.
No issues whatsoever!!Completely satisfied with this product!!
Ended up being a little TOO powerful.
Love it very very powerful. And gets hot if you need it to. Cord is average wish it was longer as this feels more like a professional blower. Love the feel of the blower too it doesn't slide out of your hands and it's not very heavy.
Love it. It is very powerful hair dryer. I like it because it also folds up & takes less space
had difficulty with switches due to reduced mobility of my hands. no problem with any other features
Way better quality than I expected for the price! Love it!!
Exactly what I wanted. Great price. Retracting cord a little hard to get use to. Don't retract it most of the time.
It's ok.
The dryer itself works great , but the attachments don't stay on. I was spending more time picking the attachments up off the floor than drying my hair, really a piss poor design very frustrating
Good quality!
Works great!
Great stand. Movable.Good performance for the price I paid. Not as hot as salon dryers.
Perfect!
Great dryer. Dries quickly, love the different temperature settings. It is a little heavier than I expected, but so far, so good!
Love this blow dryer
works well.  Just as good as a $200.00 unit
good
This is absolutely the best thing I've ever brought on Amazon and I've brought a lot of stuff. The only reason why I gave it 3 stars is because it takes a little longer to dry my hair than the salon but I will take that extra 30 mins saving $60 a week going to the salon. I have Malaysian hair sew in, I usually go to the salon every week for a roller wrap or some wand curls but I will never ever go back to the salon again unless I'm going for a sew in. My curls come out so bouncy and pretty. I look like I just stepped out of a salon. The dryer was easy to assemble and it's better being in the comfort of my own home
Good product and quite!
Great
This one replaced the last Remington that I had (and loved) since 2002! I have very long hair that's color treated, and these types of hair dryers are a life saver.  I hope this one lasts 13 years... added bonus... it matches my purple-accented bathroom.  :)
Bought this for my sister in law and she was very happy
This is NOT a true diffuser. A real diffuser does not blow your hair; it heats your hair.  This blows your hair like a regular blow dryer. I returned it after a few tries.
I purchased this because the sidewalks at my workplace are very uneven, and every time it rains we get huge puddles that cannot be avoided. My shoes always get drenched, and I needed a way to quickly and easily dry them. For that purpose, I've found this hair dryer to be very useful and efficient. I also use it to warm my socks in the winter. There's no better feeling than being out in the cold with warm feet.I can't speak to its intended purpose, as I don't have hair and so have not used it to dry my hair. Please don't hold this against me.
muy bueno.
Only used it for 2 weeks. The bottom piece would get too hot! I got burned a couple times and it also melted my extension cord because of the heat. Total disappointment!
BEFORE BUYING THIS ITEM, PLEASE READ THIS REVIEW! IT COULD SAVE YOU FROM BEING BUYING A DEFECTIVE ITEM THAT COULD BURN YOU!When I opened up the package, the packing for the blow-dryer was bent and looked open. Despite that, I thought maybe it just got damaged from shipping. When I opened up the package, it looked used. The blowdryer itself and the attachments (especially the diffuser) were all scratched; almost like they were used. Still, I thought, Maybe this was just a packaging issue and got damaged via UPS or during the shipping process. I wanted to test out the product before returning it. I severely regret even trying out this item before returning it.I plugged in the blow-dryer and attached the diffuser attachment. It didn't seem to blow air very well at all. My $25 Conair blow-dryer actually blows out more air than this did! I only had the blow-dryer plugged in for maybe a minute and realized it just didn't work. I actually got burnt because the diffuser got so hot! I now have a little welt on me from accidentally touching it. I can easily seeing this blow-dryer causing a fire or really harming somebody! I will never buy a 'Pro Beauty Tools' item again. The fact that this item was even labeled as a professional, blow-dryer is a joke. It blows no air and is cheaply made. The supposed $150 value is a joke, as well. Like I said, my $25 Conair blow-dryer is much, much better than this joke of a dryerNow I have no blow-dryer, a mini welt and irritated skin. Save your time, physical health and money and buy something else. Like I said, I can really see this endangering somebody -- whether by burning them severely (I wasn't even using the dryer for 2 minutes before becoming burnt) or causing a fire of some sort. The diffuser attachment also stayed hot for quite awhile which I've never seen before with a blow-dryer before.
great!!!
I bought this hair dryer because my last one finally died after about 5 years. I was looking for something inexpensive and high quality, which often doesn't go together.The good: For the most part, this dryer does exactly what it says it will. It dried my hair slightly faster than my previous dryer, and left it frizz free. I have very fine hair, so it almost always gets poofy. The tapered end made it easier to target the air to the rolling brush, which makes a big difference when compared to a snub nosed dryer (those aren't professional beauty terms, just the best words I can think of to describe the product). It's a decent size and easy to store. The motor is VERY quiet compared to other hair dryers I've used. My boyfriend gets up an hour later than I do for work, and he definitely appreciates the quiet motor.The bad: Just an aesthetic thing, it smells weird. To be fair, it's brand new so it's probably the smell from the packaging; but it also produces a faint odor when the motor runs that reminds me of like a toy blow dryer. I'll update the review if the smell goes away. For it's average size, it's fairly heavy. I'm not sure if it's because a larger motor, heavier materials, etc. I was using it for about 10 mins and my arm started to get sore! It's not insanely heavy, definitely manageable, but I would give it a higher ranking if it was a lighter and easier to hold. Also, the controls operate opposite any dryer I've ever had. So, instead of sliding the control up to get a faster speed or hotter temp, you slide down. That has definitely taken some getting used to. Finally, the attachments are just OK. They connect to the dryer well, but if you're like me, you are kind of a klutz when blow drying your hair. I usually knock the dryer with my brush or my hand at some point during the drying process and the attachments fall off at the slightest bump.Overall - it does what it says it will and does fine for what I paid for it. In hindsight, I wish I would've splurged another 10 or 20 bucks for something nicer.ight, I wish I would've splurged another 10 or 20 bucks for something nicer.
Very pleased with this travel hair dryer. Compact and lightweight and works really well.
Not too big and not too small! Does it's job well!
Works good
This is my third one in 15 years.  They are convenient and very reliable.  A great buy!
Great dryer! I have had this for several years and it still works great! Definitely recommend!
Took a chance but this does not fit the Conair Folding Handle 1875-Watt Dryer / Model 124TL. The search continues! (And now I'm stuck with this since I just missed the return window!)
I couldn't use it because it did not have an UL Listed cord on it
Excelente
This is buy far the best hair dryer ever! I have thick curly hair that usually takes an hour to dry. This hair dryer took less than half the time to get my hair dry
THE WORST HAIR DRYER EVER!!!!! I bough just 6 months ago and it started to have a weird noise and was not working well and the next time I tried to use it the cable exploded in FIRE, burned my hand and almost caused a fire!!!!!!
I have never had a blow dryer this amazing before, I don't even know where to begin.  The first thing I noticed was this blow dryer is a little heavier than my current blow dryer....I guess that's what it takes to be such a phenomenal blow dryer! It's not so heavy that you won't want to use it, and it's surprisingly compact.You get two attachments, a concentrator nozzle, which if you've never used one before is amazing for keeping your hair smooth and silky.  You get a finger diffuser as well; which is great for curly hair or waves without the frizz.  I've never been able to blow dry my hair and get curls that I love up until now.  Normally my hair is a big ball of frizz after blowdrying it, but I was able to get frizz free curls with the help of this diffuser.I straighten my hair frequently and for the longest time I had to let my hair dry overnight because blow drying my hair would just cause it to frizz and even using a straightener wouldn't get rid of the frizz.  Now I just use the concentrator nozzle and it really helps keep the frizz at bay when I want to blow dry it straight.  Quite possibly my favorite thing about this blow dryer is the fact that not only does it have a cool shot button, it has a COOL setting, I have A LOT of hair and holding down that cool shot button for my whole hair can be a pain, now I can just switch it to the cool setting. Overall, I love this blow dryer, it's the best one I've ever owned.I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.
Like it but not too much
Perhaps it's strange coming from me, but I've purchased 2 of these and it's still my favorite blow dryer!I used this dryer for more than 4 years and never had a problem.I purchased a second one because I gave the first one to my fiance', who lives in Japan!Her mom fell in love with it, didn't bring it to the States so I had to buy yet another ConAir blow dryer :).But now she has my second one, and won't accept the ConAir Infiniti Pro I bought for her.Too bad, because I miss my cordless action :(But I can still blow dry my hair after taking the braids out, because this is by far the best dryer ever.
A great item to have when traveling to Europe because of its dual voltage capability . Easy to use. Convenient to carry.
This unit caught on fire within 3 months of purchase
It does the job but fan makes a funny noise when powering down.
This is the best hair dryer I have ever purchased. It provides tons of power and isn't loud. It dries my hair quickly and doesn't hsve shutting off issues like other dryers I have used. The bed head brand seems to be experts in their field and make products that work well and hold up well. They last a long time and I have no complaints.
Good hair dryer for the price! thank you!
I did like this product but it was missing pieces when I got it. I couldn't hang it up or keep it together. I am debating ordering another one because I really want to use it, just hope the next time it arrives complete. If it didn't have those missing pieces it would have worked well.
Does the job at an unbeatable price! I have very thick Romanian long straight hair and this dries my hair well and pretty fast. Great product and would buy again if I had to.
Just does not get hot enough
Bought it for my daughter - Works great  and she likes it.
More power than expected.
Works great for its intended use, especially for how small it is!
My old blow dryer was this exact model and I absolutely loved it. However, the one that came in from Amazon for this purchase disappointed me as the retractable cord doesn't work.
Love this hair dryer!!!  It gets hot enough and blows hard enough to dry your hair quickly!!!!  My teenage girls with long hair love it too!!!!  It also lasts forever!!!!
Powerful yet compact hair dryer. Works really well!
This is the absolute best blow dryer I have ever owned and I have owned many over the last 45 years.
My favorite so far. Takes less time to dry and is quiet. My original one stopped working after about 1 1/2 year, they sent me a replacement right away. I had the new one in 2 days!
Great purchase, great product, very fast shipment- love it
Have had mine for several years and am thinking about getting another one as a back-up.
My old Con-Air finally bit the dust. I had been impressed with my hair stylist's hair dryer, but I knew such an expensive unit was out of my budget. However, I was willing to spend a little more than $20 on a drugstore hair dryer that, hopefully, would last a bit longer this time. I have very short, very, very fine hair. When it was longer, I used to require a diffuser since it is naturally wavy; however, with my current pixie cut, I knew I only really needed a unit that came with a concentrator nozzle. Because of the short-length and fineness of my hair, I also wanted a unit that had a good range of temperatures and speeds. A lot of what's available on the market now is too hot and too powerful for my hair. I did a bit of research for hair dryers that matched my criteria and finally settled on this. The extremely positive reviews left by other Amazon customers gave me confidence I had made a good decision.Happily enough, turns out I was correct! This unit feels solid. It is well-constructed, and doesn't have the hot spots like my old Con-Air did that caused its paint to flake off everywhere. It is a touch heavier than my old dryer, but I like the way it feels in my hand. The bit of added weight does not make the unit any more difficult to use. It is also powerful! The motor on this dryer is of much better quality than any I've used previously, causing an increase of air throughput that allows the unit to dry hair very quickly. Paradoxically, this unit performs much better than any 1875 W hair dryer I've ever used, and yet it is much, much quieter, and range of airflows gives it finesse. It comes with 3 different temperature settings and 3 different airflow settings, and I have found the medium temperature and medium airflow to be perfect for my needs. If you use the highest temperature setting, it will get hot! So if you need the high temp and high power, it is definitely there for you. It also comes with a concentrator nozzle, the output width of which in my opinion, is the perfect length. Some nozzles tend to be exorbitantly wide, which is probably fine if you have a lot of hair. But the output width of this nozzle is only around 2, perfect for a shortie like me.What more can I say? I am extremely happy with this purchase. It does arrive in a box that looks like it came straight out of the late 80s/early 90s, which I just found to be humorous. It is very no-muss, no-fuss, and I don't even think mine had packaged instructions with it. But it works just as well as my stylist's professional dryer and at a terrific price point. I would buy again in a heartbeat (but hopefully I won't have to, at least for a long, long time).
I love this hair dryer.
I have long hair so it used to take me over 10 minutes to dry my hair completely. Now i can get it dry in less than 5 minutes! It's also useful to know that when you have it on the low/medium speed, it's uber quiet. I can blow dry my hair at night without having to worry about waking my family members. Definitely worth the money.
Garbage. Had it for a year, the cheap plastic fan is cracked and it's done.
Much quieter than my old hairdryer. Works great, love the option for warm, hot or cool settings. Wish it collapsed so it fit in my drawer better but otherwise its great for the price .My sister is a hairdresser and she buys cheap hair dryers, says its not worth the money to buy expensive ones.
Works great.  This brand was in our resort in Florida and my husband just had to have his own!
Did not last nearly as long as it should of, poorly made
For the price it was not bad
Works fine, price is right.
Strong blow ; great design ; it has a bit of a weight to it but its great ! ;; i got no diffuser but i got a concentrator attachment
very good
nice
I love this hair dryer the only thing it is missing is a retractable cord
My hair dryer took a dump and nothing I hate more than finding another one.  After reading the reviews, I purchased the Conair Pro Styler Ionic Conditioning Hair Dryer.  It was ok but did nothing for my fine thin hair.  I was going to get another Revlon hair dryer but thought ok I will give this one a try even though it has the same wattage as the Conair Pro Styler and with a 35% Amazon Prime Member Sale Discount, what the heck, I really couldn't go too wrong. Love it!  My hair was much smoother and the mild curl I like was put into my hair with ease. Minimal fly aways which the Revlon didn't minimize.  Found my dryer!
The hair dryer is stylish and does a fine job with hair drying.  I like the hook on the side that keeps the cord in place.
best blow dryer for price
Love it!  Quiet and powerful, cord retracts well.
Not very strong. Does the job. Doesn't have a lot of heft so it makes me think it won't last long, which is fine since we don't really love it.
Amazing blow dryer! Worth every penny! I have naturally curly hair and this blow dryer gets it almost totally straight! Amazing power and heat! Product just like expected and shipping was fast for the free option. Got it in about a week!
love it
So far I love this hair dryer. I was bummed that my old Conair died after 10 years. Yes you read that right. 10 years!! I loved that hair dryer and I loved how quickly it dried my hair. The new dryer works well so far. It has different speeds and heat levels on two different controls which I really like. The cold air button works great. I really have no complaints.
I'm a professional hairdresser and unusual buy chi  which are 3 times the cost of this at first I bought 1 to see how I liked it. .I LOVED THIS DRYER needless to say I bought another. been extremely  happy with it..
Amazing hair dryer!
The bad thing about this is that it has a whirlwind that make it hard to dry hair and the (whirlwind causes hair to spin and tangle).The good thing is that it drys quick and is quiet
**UPDATE 07/09/17**  This dryer has been getting very hot on the hand piece. It makes a click noise and then gets hot. I recently saw sparks shoot when the clicking occured and am scared to use it. My husband and I looked at it together and he was able to see it spark multiple times while on. I hate that this has occured but feel the need to warn others.Original review: his almost perfect. I love the finish. Very hot with several great settings. Its a bit heavy. The cord is a bit short. My hair has been sucked into the mesh filter in back several times, knotting it and burning it. I have longer hair and this happens when I flip my head over and the ends touch the back of the dryer while drying roots. I have had to learn to keep space. I would buy it again though.
Good!
The electrical plug was unsteady from day one. Now, less than six weeks later the plug won't stay in the outlet at all.  It has been a little over 30 days so I cannot return it to Amazon.  I am very disappointed.
It's nice and dries quickly, just it's super noisy, can wake the neighbors up!
This is a great dryer for the price.
OMG I love this blow dryer.  I just recently replaced my old blow dryer with this one and I can see a huge improvement in my hair.  It dries quickly and stores nicely.  Love this!
No complaints. She loves it. I used to hate drying my hair but now I actually enjoys it. &#60;-----Actual girlfriend quoteDraws A LOT of power. Tripped the breaker in our old house. Not so anymore.
I'm a hairdresser who was recently introduced to this dryer in the past year. When I look for a dryer I want a lot of air, and a lot of heat. This has both. If you know proper blow-dry technique, you can do a full head of long curly hair in 15 minutes. It comes with two nozzles: a large one, and a small one. I have one pet peeve though, the cord needs to be longer. If you all are looking for a strong European quality hairdryer, this is definitely the one.
I have bought this same or very similar dryer for each of my last three houses. I love them mounted right next to the bathroom sink. It works well and for the money I think they are of pretty good quality.
Works great not very loud, it's hot which is fine with me!
Best blow dry that I have ever owned.  Worth the money.  Cord never gets tied up
This is my absolute favorite hairdryer! I have been using it for probably 10 years! When I moved out after college, I bought one for my apartment since my mom wanted to keep hers! Haha. It works amazing. I adore the diffuser attachment! Best one I've ever used.
I owned this hair dryer for about five years and used it nearly daily. It finally started making a weird noise so I replaced it with the exact same model. A five year life span for such an inexpensive hair dryer exceeded my expectations.
This blow dryer dries my hair in half the time my old one did. My hair is really curly and I like it better straight and this product has the power to make my hair nice and smooth without much effort. It has a cool blast switch to lock the style in place. I don't have to use as much hair product because this blow dryer makes my hair straight with basically just a brush. If you have frizzy hair this is the blow dryer for you
This dryer was perfect blow speed for my long fine hair.  High blow was drying and so was low.  Low allowed styling unlike my other (conair 1875 which missed class on what does High versus Low mean)..  Great selections for any speed/heat you want.  On this one,  I give kudos to however designed the switches - probably a woman.  This is light-weight and had everything I wanted Except ---&#62; it did not appear to be truly ionic for me.  My hair looked terrible.  The box and inside pamphlet states ionic, but the dryer did nothing for my hair.  It was a limp flyaway mess.  Disappointed as the rest of it was great.  This may work for you and I would recommend you give it a try.
Mom's love it
Nice and compact with lots of drying power. Also not as loud as some other hair driers.
I like the way it folds up, but the cord rarely retracts all the way without spending 5 minutes pulling it out and pressing the retract button and pushing it back into the handle. The blower itself works fine, but I bought it for the retractable cord, which is more a pain than a gain.
great
good
Second time buying this item because I wore the first one out. Love it.
Quick drying of hair without making it brittle.  Gave my hair quite a bit of volume as well which was a plus!
I did not like the design or the size so I sent it back. Pretty clunky-looking and too large for my dinky bathroom.
I purchased this item last year and used it once. It worked very well. However, I became pregnant and didn't have time to focus on my hair. When I went back to use it again earlier this year, it toppled over and the legs on the base broke. I tried gluing it together but it didn't work. I am disappointed because I was hoping to be able to use this for a while but I guess not.The top is definitely WAY too heavy for the base it comes with. Hoping I can find something that will suffice or buy a replacement base. Otherwise, that's $104 down the drain. Not cool...
The ideal hair dryer, small yet powerful.
Great dryer.
Works great cools itself Down would buy again
My first hairdryer, so I don't have much to compare it to, but it works great for me.
retracting cord did not work after a few days!
Got it for wife to replace old hair dryer she had and she loves it don't have to sit in one spot.
Great air pressure
Great dryer. It is very powerful and gets my hair dry much faster than my old one.
This is a great product. It's bulky, but you can hang it.It works, but for all of the advertising hoopla, I don't think it's that different.
like it, very durable. it won't dry your hair really quickly but that is good for your hair.
I like this hair dryer and can't believe the price for such a great quality dryer.  Highly recommend.  Way better than anything at Walmart or Target.
Love it
Have had it for 8 months, works great. Don't know how it does it, but it dries my hair 3 times faster and with less heat than my old hairdryer. Not disappointed.
very good
It can tip over if you are not careful and it is a little bit suffocating-feeling when you put down the visor. It is definitely not for someone afraid of small spaces!
So far so good.  Dries my hair without any frizz, is lightweight and not noisy.  Comes with a nice 4 year warranty.
I bought Remington Ac2015 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Ceramic Hair Dryer almost a years ago (02 August 2014), and it is a great hair dryer - definitely a 5 stars.Both I and my husband (and occasionally our dog) have been using this hair dryer on a daily basis - we're among those people who always dry their hair - and it still works perfectly.I am quite picky when it comes to hair dryer: I like them to be powerful enough to dry my hair quickly, but I also want them to be gentle not to kill my hair. The Remington AC2015 does its job nice and quickly.I have long (almost waist length), thick, and very straight hair. I wash them every 2-3 days using natural products (Lush shampoo and conditioner), and also oil them a couple times a week (Jojoba oil + either rosemary or lavender essential oil). I use a wooden brush - but only when they're dry. So yes, I really love and care for my hair! But when it comes to drying them, I can't imagine to spend a lot of time doing it. My drying routine is simple: 1) I remove most of the water with a towel (gently) and use my fingers to remove tangles; 2) then I blow-dry my hair upside down; 3) finally, I brush them. The whole procedure takes me approx. 15 minutes, using the maximal power (level 3) and heat (again 3) of the hair dryer.My husband has way shorted and fewer hair than I do, straight and thin. He uses my same shampoo and conditioner, but won't do anything more than that. He wouldn't need to use a hair dryer, but love the feeling. It takes him less than a minute to be perfectly dry.My dog is a Scottish Terrier - so she's small but has longish and super thick fur. We wash her in the bathtub with natural Castille soap. To dry her fur, we first wrap her in a towel, and remove most of the water, then we use the hair dryer alternating medium heat (level 2) and cold air to avoid burning her skin. When she starts being somewhat dryer, we use her brush to attack the most hidden hair (e.g. armpits). It takes us approx. 1 hour.To sum up, this hair dryer is durable and high quality - a great bang for the buck!
Broken after 1 year
Amazon here says I've been using this since September of 2011. Wow. Well, I still love it, has all the low to high, hot to cool options I need. I have no complaints about this and I would definitely buy it again if something were to happen to it.Great purchase.:)
Blew out coils after 2 weeks of use.
It works very well and I use it everyday!
Love this dryer. I bought one for my daughter because she wanted mine!
I love everything about this hairdryer - it is smaller, quieter, hangs on the wall and I just plain LOVE IT!
Works great but a little heavy.
Beat blow dryer! My husband purchased one for me at Ukta for $80. It had a short in it and blew up. I purchased this one off Amazon. I have crazy thick hair. It takes me about 15-20 minutes to blow dry. This cuts the time down in half. It is on the heavy side and the buttons are in a horrible place, buy I love it!
Love this hair dryer becuse its small and powerful!
Excellent product. We purchased this blow dryer in 2009 and it is still going strong.
Good hair dryer especially for the price!!
The chemical odor associated with this dryer is so bad, even after sitting out for a week, I had to return it.  Maybe need a different manufacturing process...
Great!
I love conair products. I never had any issue with Conair Products in past and I will keep on buying it in future. I bought this one for my mom because of its size. Its small, light and folds inside which is good for travelling purpose. My mom loved the size and color. The noise from the dryer is not loud.
Powerful little dryer, and I love the small size, it fits well in my tiny bathroom.
Lasted about a year.  I'm back to Remington, I used Remington hair dryers for years and they last the longest.  Just bought a new $20.00 one at Walmart and even it has a  2 year guarantee on it.
Love it!! Drys hair fast!! No frizz!!
It is too loud.  I googled quiet hair dryers and it came up.
I actually love how this dryer performs but it looses its motor and heat too quickly, had to send back to the manufacturer within 4 months already once and doing the same thing again
I like it.  It dries my hair pretty quickly and I have long hair.
There's a learning curve with this dryer. What I've learned:1. Don't dry your hair all the way (if it's curly) The frizz will erase all the work you just did.2. Place your hair cradled in the dryers teeth and THEN turn it on. Hold for as long as you need, then turn the dryer off before moving to a new section. Any time this dryer is not full of hair and right up next to your scalp, it's making a frizz mess.3. After drying 75% of the way, stop and clip up your roots to avoid flat head. I find that the hair next to my scalp is still a little damp and susceptible to flatness.It's a fine dryer, and I use it occasionally when I'm in a hurry, but for curly hair (I'm a 2c/3a with fine hair) I find it's always best to air dry.
Great product!
First used this hairdryer model in a hotel room last fall and loved it. My own hairdryer finally gave out so I had the opportunity to buy this, very happy with it. Retraction of the cord works very well compared to my previous one, and I feel like I have less frizz after drying my hair with this one, probably because it has the diffuser at the end. Even on the highest setting it's not too hot.
Love it
I was skeptical because it was so small but this baby packs a punch.  My hair is past the halfway point of my back. I have long thick hair and it is ombred (bleached). Sometimes chemically treated hair takes forever to dry but this thing does the job as if it's a regular sized hair dryer. Definitely a plus. If it breaks, you'll bet I'll just buy another without complaint.
It works as expected, the button to retract the cord is little stiff otherwise it is prefect.
Excellent travel dryer for our European trip.  The only downside is that when used with higher voltage you can only use one setting.  The low setting is high at 220V, but it worked well for our purposes.  I recommend this highly.
Great product and super fast delivery.
I love the hair dryer.  It's small enough, not heavy or cumbersome so that it wont aggravate my carpal tunnel syndrome.
Basic hair dryers for a WM price.  Why stand in line when you can get on Amazon for the same price?  I bought one for each bathroom in a rental property.
Very cool
REALLY GREAT GETS VERY HOT
This hair dryer is by far the best one that I have ever owned! The price was definitely right! I love how quiet it is compared to other hair dryers that I have owned! It has three heat settings and three speed settings along with the cool button that you can press to get a blast of cool air. It dries my hair a lot faster than other hair dryers and it leaves my hair feeling softer than when I dry it with other hair dryers. I would definitely recommend this to others!
bought this to replace the exact same model for my wife that was 10 years old... it's a good product... works really good and easy to store...
It was nice while the retractable cord worked, but that stopped working after 2 months. Now I have to stand right next to the outlet because the cord won't pull out.
Purchased this product at the end of March as a result of positive reviews. It periodically shut off until finally this week it stopped working completely. After only 4 months, a hair dryer should not stop working. Definitely would not recommend.
Just wht I was looking for. Great product.
i love it
This hair dryer is not adjustable and does not have enough heating power
Does not  last.  Flew apart in pieces one afternoon while using it.  I am a guy and only use it a few minutes a day.  Plus, the new version is built much cheaper.  Not worth $49.  Never had a fan blade split apart like this dryer.
One of the best!
My girlfriend has had this for 3 days, so obviously comments on longevity can't be included. It works well, light, cute colors, can't complain.
I love this! Not only does it take way less time to dry my hair this way when I'm in a hurry, but it makes my hair voluminous and wavy instead of flat and oily and curly in all the wrong places! There's a bit of frizz but it's not bad compared to what I've experienced at the hands of a regular hair dryer. Amazing product for a curly haired girl!
This is my second one as the first one got a short in it.  I love not having the hairdryer laying out in the way.  It helps keep my bathroom organized
doesn't even work i dont know why i've kept mine for so long... oh well
All ok
This hair dryer blows so much smoke, it has to be unhealthy for my hair. When I made this purchase I was looking for a high wattage, ceramic ionic hair dryer. After the first use, I have realized that it probably has a high wattage but the other selling points may not be true. I have always purchased professional hair dryers and never did they blow out smoke like this one. I do not recommend this product and wish I didn't waste my money in such a poor quality tool.
This product was a terrible disappointment. The retractable cord stopped retracting almost the first time I used it.
NOT ENOUGH BLOW
I've had this blow dryer for probably a little longer than a year and I absolutely love it. It's blow power is incredibly strong compared to most dryers (think hurricane vs gentle breeze). Of course, you can use the low setting which is powerful too but if you want to dry your hair fast, this dryer will not disappoint. It also heats up quickly, cools down quickly, comes with several attachments, and has a long cord. The only downside is that I don't like where the buttons are because the way I hold it to dry my hair, many times, I accidentally turn the heat onto cool without meaning to. I would buy this a thousand times over.
The hair dryer actually worked great for a few months but after using the cool button the other day it will not blow any warm air.
Dryer itself works ok. Packaging is horrible. It came in a broken box and a tangled unraveled cord. Not suitable for a gift. Ok if it's for your own personal use.
Don't waste your money.  I mounted it and it's terrible - loud and doesn't dry hair very well at all..now I have to unmount again.
Great dryer. We like it very much.
I waited until I used the hair dryer for a couple months before writing a review.  I have medium length hair and dry my hair about 4 days a week.  So far this hair drying has held up very well.  It's light weight and is actually a little quieter than my previous Revlon hair dryer that died after 10 years of use.  I don't use the diffuser because it doesn't do a thing for my board straight hair.  For the money this is an excellent dryer.
This dryer does its job well and is convenient to use.  They really should consider changing the elastic in the bonnet to a string that is more adjustable. The elastic was so tight that I cut it out and restrung it with a shoelace. There would have been no way I could have fit rollers in it without doing that.
the first time I used it, I cut it on high and the motor popped.
👍🏽
I really like this dryer.  Not sure why complaints about the cord - directions say to hold the plug.  If you don't hold the plug of course it's gonna snap back and hit you.  As for the noise.  Yes, it is noisy but you are using it for a short time and it is just as noisy as any other hair dryer.  And it is not too heavy.  I think it dries my hair fast and arm does not get tired.  All in all, I would recommend this dryer.  I love that it is pink, the cord retracts and takes up little space for storage.
Dries hair quickly without getting too hot.
Works fine--- couldn't be better
I bought this item and it shipped on June 9. I bought a place and finally got to putting it up July 12.  It didn't work; it didn't even turn on. I went online to Amazon to exchange it for one that worked, but they said my last date to return it was July 11. So I say don't bother buying this piece of crap; and be careful about buying things thru Amazon.
Drys my thick hair fast!!
I expected it to be smaller.
My wife loves it!!!
Our clients love it. It has a quality look to it.
Great hair dryer, just the right speed and temperature to do your hair. Best hair dryer I have owned, beats out the dryers I have paid almost $200 for.
Just got this blow dryer.  It doesn't blow as hot as I expected it to heat up.  Just used it to style my hair.  But is definitely better than the ones you'd find a Walmart, etc...My hair is relaxed and tends to absorb a lot of water.  I Will post an update later with additional feedback...
Dries fast and a bit quieter then my old dryer.  Because of the wider nozzle its seems like less air, but the dry time for my hair is the same.  Perfectly happy with my new dryer.
Great
Love it
I bought this for a friend as a gift she  loves it she has her own shop .
The best
DO NOT BUY! As other reviewers have stated the area of cord where it comes out of the handle wears out and short circuits causing pops, sparks and fire! This happened after 1 year of use almost to the day. I live alone and use it once/day mostly on high heat. The problem is obviously a cheap cord that when bent back and forth enough times will wear the wire enough to short out. This is not a fluke but  bad design components. When I compare the cord to other dryers I clearly see the difference in cord. This cord has more of a softer  rubber feel and a dull dark color, where proper cords have a shiny finish and more of a hard vinyl feel. Believe me this will happen to all of these units eventually if you use the high heat settings daily. I would definitely not buy this again.and I would look for another brand.
Does the job for a great price :)
I love my new blow dryer. It does not dry out my hair. perfect. Thanks
Works great. Good price. Just as described
So far works great!
I appreciated the low noise level and range of heat/speed settings.  Unfortunately, the product lasted less than a month with daily use by one person.
Love this dryer. Great feature at a great price
Good item !
Excellent product. Small but very powerful.
great buy
Great
The hi setting does get very hot. The lo setting works just fine and I have thick, curly hair. It usually takes my hair a long time to dry but I can sit under this dryer 20 minutes. I hate sitting under the dryer! I have gone to the salon and have to sit an hour or more under theirs! Adjusting the height might be an issue for some. If you have a chair that can raise up and down, that will be perfect. Overall, I like this dryer. I use it about twice a month for deep conditioning treatments or to set twist styles. I'm glad I made this purchase.
The hair dryer is smaller than my regular dryer but bigger than I would have liked. It gets the job done and I like that it folds in half.
This hair dryer is very powerful and dries quickly.
Well worth the money! I'm growing super long hair and this makes my hair so soft and shiny! I should have discovered this earlier!
Reliable, reasonably loud, and lasts long. I used Conair before and those malfunction super easily.
I love this hair dryer.  Using the attached comb makes it very easy to dry my hair. Two thumbs up.
Nice hair dryer, I don't have to flip my head upside down to use it.
This is the first 1 star review I have ever written. This blow dryer worked fine for 18 months. However I heard a shriek upstairs when my wife was drying her hair. She said it was on fire and she had unplugged it. I could smell the burning smell. Later that day I started wondering why it hadn't blown a breaker and decided that possible lint had accumulated and touched the burner wire. I did clean out some lint and turned on the dryer to see if I had solved problem. No!  After about 10 seconds smoke came out, there was a burning smell, and the handle got hot. Obviously this is the last of this product for us. The warranty is out by 6 months and if it had just quit working that is one thing. But this is a safety issue and the product should be recalled.
The only problem with this dryer is that the long metal pole connecting to the hood. The round piece around the metal pole is cracked!!!  Trying to figure out how I can find a better solution then this plastic piece around the metal pole.
Nothing too special here.  Okay hair dryer.
My old hair dryer quit on me.  So this one has been used since the day it arrived.  I love it, and it does a great job of blowing my hair dry.
This Conair hair dryer works great. It runs smooth and quieter than my last hair dryer (an old Remington). The cord retracts nicely into the handle when finished. I recommend this item.
Truly a great dryer! I ordered one for my mother, who then ordered one for her sister, so naturally I had to have one of my own! Significantly reduces flat iron time. I took a star because the brush attachment does not stay on properly. It comes off the dryer once or twice while I'm using it. I have a had an issue in the past with most style dryers tripping the GFCI outlet, but have not had an issue with this one.
Amazing! Absolutely love this blow dryer. Very quick dey time and makes my hair soft and shiney!
good
Love it. Highly recommend it.
I LOVE this hair dryer!!!! I can't remember the last time my hair looked so shiny and smooth after blow drying it. I am so glad I spent a little more and got a quality hair dryer finally. I can't believe how great my hair looks after just one use! I will update my review if necessary, but if my results continue it won't be necessary! Highly recommend this awesome dryer!!
Nice hair dryer, mounted on the wall, clearing counter space and easily acceptable.  Varied during speed....great little hairdryer.
Did not meet expectations - returning for refund.  The motor is quiet but it takes a longer time to dry hair and then the hair is fly away  - not what I wanted at all.
Quality hair dryer still working years later.  Because of the rounded edges, it does not sit on a flat surface well and mine has fallen and gotten chipped over the years but it still works.
Exactly what was described is exactly what I needed! Working great!
I have long and thick hair,usually take me over and hour to dry my hair but with this hairdryer it only take me 30 minutes.
This is a great blowdryer to take traveling. Has full power in a compact size. Handle folds up nicely. Used it in France wth an adapter.
My hairdryer fried out when I was on vacation after a few months.  I replaced it with a 30$ revlon hairdryer that has lasted four years. I wouldn't waste my money on this!
Great for travel with lots of power and heat.
My first one lasted 20 years. I ordered this to replace it.
Works great, easy to use. Lightweight and not too noisy compared to others. The included attachments are great.
Good  but loud
I love this blowdryer!! It has a very powerful flow of air which is excellent for straight hair like mine. Comes with all standard attachments and I think would be great for any type of hair. Excellent quality for the price. I have had mine for over a year now and it still works like it is brand new!
Love it.  I ordered two.  Works great, small, lightweight, easy to handle.  Like the long cord and the cool shot button.
Works great and does dry very quickly.  My only complaint, and it bugs me daily, is that the switches are right where you have your fingers and they're easy to flip so I am constantly turning it off/on while drying.  That's annoying.
Product excelent. Arrive in condiction good. Thanks
Works better than my more expensive dryers.
I love this hair dryer! Used it today and it was amazing. I have thick hair and it dried it so quickly! And I used no products today and my hair is so so silky!!! Normally it takes quite a while to dry my hair and I use 2 products plus a smoothing serum at the end. This was amazing!! Great Dryer and a long cord too!! Love it!!!!
Powerful and easy to pack on domestic trip.  :)
Very pleased.  Folds nicely, cord retracts well.
Love it but the watts are so high that it keeps blowing fuses all the time!!!
This dryer is what I wanted at a reasonable price. It was easy to put on the wall.
Like it  it is pretty powerful. Took on vacation and use it in my RV too.
I absolutely love my blow dryer. It's not crazy hot to the point of burning my head but it still dries my locks;  all 3.5 feet of it.
I love this hair dryer.  I like that it dries my hair super-fast and it is super-light to hold.  The curved handle makes it easy to hold.  Great price, too!
Edited January 2016:  After only six months, this dryer is wearing out.  It gets way too intensely hot, even on the medium setting, probably because the fan is barely blowing.  Hardly any difference at all between low and high fan, and it barely makes a breeze, so my hair is getting all heat and no movement. I went out and replaced it today.
Love it!  So convenient.
Great product! Ordered and choose two day shipping and it arrived in one day. Used this product same day and got excellent results with a protein treatment I was doing.
Piece of junk.  The cord keeper feature is a joke.  The only place the cord keeper keeps it is outside of the dryer.  DO NOT BUY
good product ..! Recommended
Nice weight and power!
BROKE 2 DAYS AFTER 30 DAYS SO I CAN'T RETURN OR EXCHANGE (ON AMAZON) FOR A NEW ONE! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!I did like the dryer while it lasted, LOVED THE COLOR, however to pay money for something to work for less than 30 days, it was shipped so I lost a few days there, is a joke.  This might be the best dryer, per stars and rating on Amazon, but for the money, go to the local CVS or Rite Aid where you can take it back and exchange the product when it breaks.  Oh well, sorry AMAZON PRIME you get 0 STARS for this one too... sad because I buy almost everything with Prime.
Best hair dryer I've ever owned. I have really thick hair so I needed a professional grade dryer. It drugs my hair very quickly.
I would it like more if I could control the intensity and temperature of the dryer
It blows.  Hot.  Really well.  Amazing stamina.  Plug it in and it never stops.  Not expensive.
Best hair dryer ever!  Quite heavy if that is an issue.  I love it.
Great hairdryer, does what it needs to.
Love it, very convenient. I was thrilled when I got a hotel room and they had this hair dryer in the bathroom. I was very excited when I saw it available on Amazon. I really didn't think it would work as well as the ones in the hotel as I figured there's was a commercial grade. I was pleasantly surprised it worked just as well. I get a lot of compliments on it when I have guests, especially those that forgot to pack one or don't want to go digging for their. It is an excellent idea for bathrooms or teenagers room. My Granddaughter has asked for one to put beside her vanity. Perhaps Santa will provide.
I bought this for drying my Miniature Schnauzer furnishings at home and at shows. I picked this one because it has air coming in from both sides for maximum air flow. It works great. I've had it for nearly 2 years and use it often as I also groom for a few other owners. It still looks like new and all the switches work just like day one. I will buy again if this one ever goes out. I will also buy another one if my personal hair dryer (different brand) ever goes out. I've had it for nearly 20 years. LOL
So heavy I felt like I was lifting weights. This went back the same day.
I purchased this hair dryer after looking without success for one this small in local stores.  I have only been using it for about two weeks, and it is meeting all of my expectations thus far.  The size and weight are perfect for carrying in my swim bag, taking up much less room that my defunct dryer.  A bonus for me was the low noise level of this appliance.  I anticipated a loud, high pitched scream, due to the compact size, but it operates with quiet efficiency.  I have short hair, and this dryer delivers quick drying at a comfortable sound level with no hassle with easy packability.
Not thrilled about this one. It's cheap and it shows. Heavy to hold and dries the hair on the slower side. It doesn't have that hurricane effect as some other cheaper model. I wouldn't recommend it.
Great but a little on the loud side
Bit on the noisy side. Has more of the high pitch tone that makes it annoying. Otherwise, nice and light weight.
The unit was cracked in serveral places when I received it, but all-in-all it worked fairly well.
Such a great travel hairdryer. Also works internationally and is a great size.
Good product.
I guess I've always been using sub-par hair dryers, this one blows them out of the water (pun very much intended)Thank you to everyone else who posted a great review, this is a great one to buy and I'm glad I came here to read reviews before I purchased.  It's pretty, very powerful, and my only gripe is the buttons are reversed from my last dryer so I'm constantly making it hotter instead of turning it off :)10/10
Lots of power and easy to use.  Fit well near my vanity mirror.  Very pleased.
Super fast drying
Love it!!! Drys hair quickly!
great product.  This is the second one I have bought, to give to my niece as a birthday gift since we love ours so much.
Compact size makes this hair dryer great and easy to pack for weekend and/or longer trips.
This little dryer works great, but a few words of advice if you are traveling outside of the US.  I went to Italy so I set the switch for 220v before I left so I wouldn't forget.  The first time I plugged it in (with an adapter), I double checked to ensure it was set to 220.  I switched it on low and it was working fine.  I then switched it on high, and within seconds it became red hot.  I looked at it and immediately pulled the plug as it was just about to shoot flames.  When I looked at the voltage, it had changed back to 110.  With the dryer unplugged, I set it back to 220 and toggled the hi/lo switch.  What I realized is that it worked fine on the low setting.  The moment the setting was changed to hi, it also changed the voltage back to 110.  Once I got this figured out, I used it on low for the entire trip with no issues.  Low was enough to dry my shoulder length hair.
works very well
Cord no longer retracts.
This hairdryer exceeded my expectations.  Although it's a bit on the heavy side, its compact frame and powerful air flow fully compensate that one drawback.  One of the best hairdryers I have owned.
buenisimo
Love hair dryer. Wish the cord was longer like the original dryer purchased a few years ago!  Why did they shorten cord??
I purchased this to use on a trip to England and Ireland. I was VERY happy with it! It is very small, lightweight, and high powered. I wouldn't want to use to all the time, but I'm very happy with it for travel.
So happy I finally bought this dryer for my bathroom.  It has great power but can be gentle with the lower speed.
I have extremely curly hair and this dryer is perfect for me.  It's a little loud but worth it!
This is a replacement for the one I have had for many years.
I really like this dryer, ti does the job well,  I have  not used the attachment since I have short hair, So I have to review just the hair dryer alone it's really good, I recommend this one. Plenty of choices for air flow.
Works as a blow drier but not as well as the RV544 for just a little bit more money.
Fabulous little dryer will never go back to another type. Great settings lots of power! Hangs out of the way yet right there when you need it!
This is the best dyer I have ever used!!!! I have frizzy curly hair and when I use this dyer my hair comes out smooth and straight...
I use the concentrator every time I dry my hair. It falls off at least 10 times. It gets really hot too so it's a pain to put back on constantly. The dryer is good. Just wish the attachments stayed in place.
great dryer and delivered in just three days
bought for my 11-year old daughter, she loves it.  the price was just right, and it's simple to use. Pretty decent power, and the cold shot button works great without losing power (like some I have owned).  Would recommend as a great basic hair dryer.
Great item-- quick service--thanks!
Compact and powerful.
Travelled to Brazil and were a bit afraid that for the value it would actually work well on 220v outlets, but it works great so far! Only problem is the attachment is very lose and does not stay on, falling easily and frequently while drying my hair. But still, I recommend it!
There are not 3 levels of heat. There ARE 3 levels of blowing air, but I wish the heat was different. Not what I expected. I do like the retractable cord for the convenience of storage. I've used the dryer for about 3 weeks.
Love the built in nightlight
love this dryer.  it's quiet but powerful, and the 'cold' button really works without losing power! (unlike the last dryer I had). other reviewers mentioned it's weight, and yes it does feel more weighty than some dryers, but it's not a problem for me, sorta feels like it's more industrial and not cheap.  the outside texture of the dryer is nice too.  overall I think it was a great buy!
The only con is that it doesn't reach the back of my head. I'd have to put a pillow under my butt and lower my head and just sit there for a while, and that cramps up my neck a lot :(
Works great!  Love the retractable cord!!  It does go back in fast so I hang on the the plug (lightly) until its retracted so the plug doesn't swing around and hit something.
This is my second one. The first one has been  broken while moving home. I would say it is a product worth its price. Great deal.
This hair dryer doesn't function well after I used it for a month. It just suddenly became so hot and the wind was not as strong as before. Also it is a little bit heavy.
Too loud! All the descriptions about the noise is true.And the low setting is too low.
I don't write many reviews; but this hair dryer is the absolute best that I have ever owned and very reasonably priced.  I live in humid south Florida and have shoulder length thick hair that tends to frizz.  I have always taken care to dry my hair carefully and thoroughly with a round brush; however, after a stint in the Florida heat I am all frizz again.  I decided to upgrade my hair dryer and read many reviews before selecting this one.  I do have to add that most of the recommended hair dryers were priced well over $50 which just seems like too much to me.  The Remington AC9096 had both great reviews and a reasonable price and best of all -- IT WORKS.  I can dry my hair very quickly with this dryer using a large round brush and the end result is soft, smooth, shiny, frizz-free hair that stays frizz free even when I am outdoors.  I have not had any issues with my hair getting caught on the dryer, but like I said,  my hair is only shoulder length. If you have hair that tends to frizz in the humidity,  buy this dryer.  You will not regret it.
I bought this hair dryer recently but i ordered a comb attachment and it cannot fit... So i bought another different one that which is bigger and they said was universal an it wont fit either.. They both are too small to fit.. Can anyone tell me a size comb attachment i can buy that would fit on this hair dryer please
This blowdryer caused outages each time I used it so I had to stop and buy a new one!!
Pretty good for a home device
I bought this hair dryer at Target several years ago, and was SOOO impressed with the power, that I would randomly talk to people about my new hair dryer!!  I had long hair at the time, and it cut drying time down significantly.  Also left my waivy hair perfectly straight and silky smooth.I do think after a few years, the Ion starts to lose effectiveness (on all hair dryers I've ever had).  I had it for at least 4 years, before the back filter broke, and then my hair started getting sucked into the back.So I tried several different dryers, even expensive name brand ones like Babyliss, none that I really LOVED like this one.  I recently chopped my hair off, and am using a less powerful dryer.  But after realizing my love for this dryer, I went ahead and bought a second one, and have it put up in my closet, to use again once my hair grows back out, and I need that 'power' to straighten and dry quicklyOnly CON is that is IS a bit heavy... after having no luck with lighter ones, I realize the weight is worth it.
In addition to being one third the size and significantly lighter than my old dryer, it did the job in half the time of my more powerful unit with the same technology.  One other reviewer said that it burnt out after 2 weeks, but if it lasts I would definitely recommend it.
I used this hairdryer at a hotel and came home and bought one.  It is lightweight, and my favorite feature is that you can have high air with low heat.  Simple, cheap, and works very well!
After limited use in 5 months, the unit only works on low.Will need to get a replacement.
over heats quickly, do not recomment
Best hair dryer! Same dryer as my hair stylist.
It's a good product to buy. it's very useful.
good
Works good and outside stays cool.  Durable and heats and cools quickly.  Turbo mode great.  Be aware this dryer is very large.  The plastic hair thingy is a gimmick, but the dryer is good.
This dryer works well. I think the temps are perfect for my hair (very fine). My spouse thinks it's not quite hot enough (thick hair). I love the different fan settings on inner handle. The cool button does not change the fan speed, only the temp. I have had this for a few months now, and it really does a nice job.
Great lightweight hair dryer with 2 speeds, worked well in Italy.  Might be difficult to change to US current, but I will keep it for the next trip overseas.
well pleased
Light weight, dries efficiently. I reall like this dryer.
Arrived on time.  Nice, powerful small travel hair dryer.
excellent
Works great
Great buy.  Works just as advertised
very nice very powerful and I like the folding handle. dries my hair in no time!
Great hairdryer but I didn't get the round attachment brush and I wanted that. I tried to find a way to let the know but didn't because the writing was Asian l will continue to try to order the round attachment
This little dryer is really easy to take on the go.  It gets really hot, which is good for my incredibly thick hair, but it's great to have the cooling button on it.  It is a loud little bugger however!  Anyway, it's a good purchase.  I've used it several dozen times on trips in the States and in Europe and it's served its purpose.
Save a lot of time!
Small, light in weight & easy to use. It does the job & I love it!
Very good product. It doesn't seem to get that hot. I don't know if it just needs time to get broken in, or if the infrared technology just doesn't need the high heat. Runs VERY quietly and its built like a tank.
It was OK - liked the heaviness of it but was nothing more than just a drugstore blow dryer. Was hoping for  more of a difference due to the Tourmaline Ceramic name but nothing special or different than my last Conair blow dryer.
my wife loves it.
Its ok... light weight but noisey.
I would not purchase this product.This blower dryer arbitrarily cuts out during blow drying. It does come back on after a couple of minutes, but I've never had a blow dryer do that before.
Nice and does not fry hair!
Great power! Shortened my drying time quite a bit.
Great wall mount dryer.
very good
We found this at a local store just looking for a cheep hair dryer, and I have to say that I am incredibly impressed with its performance. We have had this running for a minimum of three hours straight and it hasn't skipped a beat! First time we used it, we forgot to press the cool air button and ended up melting PVC pipe, so as far as heat goes, this thing is awesome. Its heat resistance is also pretty impressive! We have had it right up next to  about 1200° F and it kept working (it had a bit of distance from the heat since we connected it to PVC pipe, but the PVC funneled heat right into the dryer when it was off). Today we even had it next to about 1300° F and not a thing went wrong! So all in all we have ran this in pretty intense environments and it hasn't failed us yet. We've ran it 4 times like this and it was able to preform perfectly each time. Only problem we had was that at around hour 2 the first time we used it, the back started to smoke. We thought that maybe we had bought a cheep dryer and that we'd need a different one, but soon after it stopped and hasn't done it since. We were using it in a small drizzle which might impact performance, so don't use it for 2 hours in a slight drizzle. Once it started really raining, we moved into a garage and continued using it, and after that it stopped smoking. But all in all I'd say that it is a very good purchase for a low price. Once ours busts I will most likely purchase another Revlon.
Love this dryer! Had it for a couple of years and it's still going strong. Powerful and HOT!
I love it!
I love this hairdryer. It has a lot of power and I like that it has three heat settings as well as two fan settings .  It is not too loud and not too heavy.
Love this hair dryer for the price!
I love this in that it dries my hair fast. Hood needs to be deeper - but does the trick.  My hair is short - could be hard for someone with long hair.
Very happy with this hair dryer, and the price!  I have baby fine hair, and I'm able to dry it without leaving it all frizzy.  I clung to my 1500 watt blowdryer for years, until it finally died, since the 1800-watt dryers I'd tried had all given me dismal results.  Maybe it's the ceramic that makes the difference - but in any event I am pleased with this purchase!
Just as fast drying as promised.  Glad for the force choices.  The high speed seems to tangle my straight bob
Fit right where the old dyers was mounted. Great replacement for a reasonable cost.
The dryer has several good features, and I especially appreciate the cool setting and how the cool button delivers air with absolutely no heat at all.  Other dryers I've had have produced still slightly warm heat even when the cool button is used.  Not this one!!!!  The downside for this dryer is the diffuser attachment.  It is much too small and does not diffuse well enough to not have my fine 2 b/c wavy hair not blow all over.  Luckily I was able to use a diffuser attachment from my dryer that fried recently (prompting this purchase).  Otherwise I would have had to return this dryer, even as much as I'm loving the cool air feature.  Hence only a three star rating.
I was so excited to use this hair dryer for the first couple of months, then ad some of the other customer reviews had stated it quit working.  The heating part of it just stopped about 6 months in. So sad :-(
I bought this to replace my aging Hot Tools dryer. The air flow is weak, it doesn't get very hot, and there aren't any vents near the nape of my neck, so the back of my hair is never dry. I would return it if I still had the box.
Wow.  Honestly, I was a bit skeptical about whether there would be any difference between this hairdryer and the $20 ones I have been using my whole life.  I couldn't be more wrong!  This dryer is truly head and shoulders above anything I've tried before.  Please read on to hear about the technology, results and how to properly use this should you be convinced to take the plunge!The TechnologyRather amazing technology here from the engineers at Panasonic.  Using a high electric potential they create negative ions which trap water molecules from the air and combine them with the hot air jet of a conventional dryer.  By doing this, they buffer the air jet with moisture which in turn prevents damage to hair.  Panasonic has been leaders in this area of technology which is why Japan enjoys the best selection of such hair dryers.The ResultsAs other reviewers have pointed out, hair is dried quicker and with softer, shinier results!  My hair is short, but for most women with longer hair, the results should be even better!  It is designed to run cooler to protect hair from heat, so if you dry your hair everyday you would significantly reduce cumulative damage to hair.Before you use:You must be aware of the electrical requirements for using this fine hair dryer.  Since it was designed for the Japanese domestic market, it is made for their electrical system, not the U.S.  Although the plugs in Japan and the U.S. look the same, the electricity supply is very different.  I am an electrical engineer and I have lived in Japan, continue to use many Japanese products in the U.S. so I understand the differences well and how to work around them.  In Japan they use 100 volts, however in the U.S. we use 120 volts.  That means by plugging in a Japanese product directly into the U.S. system, you would overload the product by 20%.  For a high wattage device like a hair dryer that is a considerable amount over the intended design!  Indeed some other reviewers have posted pictures of melted dryers and claimed they were defective.  However, if properly used this should not happen.  In fact, I noticed that when I use mine, the hair dryer itself stays quite cool.See my pictures below which show the electric sticker saying 100v (if it were ok for U.S. it would have a range that included 120v).  I have also posted 2 pictures of my dryer plugged in to a transformer.  Note the first one with the power off, my voltage reader measures 105volts (this is close enough to 100v).  The second one has the power on, and it is consuming 1148 watts.  (That is more than many microwaves, so you can imagine with 20% overload why people were experiencing bad smells, melting and early failure!)I warn that a proper stepdown transformer (capable of at least 1200 watts minimum for this dryer) will be expensive.  But used within its capacity will last forever.  I personally recommend Japanese made transformers from companies such as Sanyo, Nissyo or Toyozumi.  I have heard poor quality control on Chinese made ones, so given the high cost of the dryer (or any other Japanese product you would consider, i.e. Panasonic Nanocare steamer) I would invest in the best transformer.  Furthermore, I would not hesitate to purchase a Japanese transformer used on eBay as these are very durable items and you can often get a great deal (they come up from time-to-time.)5 stars!  When used properly will provide incredibly healthy looking hair!d some other reviewers have posted pictures of melted dryers and claimed they were defective.

Meets my needs perfectly.!
It works good and has a great nightlite
Didn't work with an inverter or converter started smoking while abroad. But has a lot of power for a small dryer
good so far
Good when working.  Cord broke at handle in a few months
two speeds and two heat settings.  does not have air only setting.
YES!!!
Tooooooo small than that I expected. Can grab in one hand. Really small
Like most reviews I have the same comments.  A little heavy but doesn't really bother me.  I wish there was a removable grill/screen on the back to prevent hair from getting in.  I like that it isn't too loud.  It is a good hair dryer and a decent price.
This is a new kind of dryer for me. It has an ionizer in it or something similar to that. When the hair dryer is on there is an orange glow coming from the nozzle. I have very thick hair and it takes me forever to dry it. This hair dryer cut that time down significantly. I would definitely recommend it
Another great product. You have many settings available to you and the retractable cord is a real bonus. I hang my blow dryer in a over the door hair product caddy,  and it's much easier to close the cabinet door now without a cord getting in the way. I have very fine, short hair and this dryer fluffed it up nicely and it's very fast.
I don't like that the diffuser doesn't prevent my hair from blowing all over the place when I'm trying to dry my curls with little air movement.
Perfect size for the small suitcase I had to use for a trip to Italy.  It has good power and works well.
I had high hopes for this dryer based on the reviews, but it's marginal at best.  The heat setting is pretty weak, and if you have a ton of hair, forget about it.  For me, I'll keep using it, but my wife said she'd never be able to use this on a daily basis.
Pros:  Saves room on the counter, compact size, HI setting is strong.Cons:  It only lasted two years and one month.  Had to re-order one again today because we had already installed the metal panel on the wall and didn't want to have to take it off and repaint and redo it all.Hopefully this new one will come soon and last longer. We shall see...
Same weight as my old big dryer.  Not lightweight!
Overall a great hair dryer, but since the outer shell along with attachable head nozzles are plastic, it can emit a somewhat funky smell if left on for too long and on too high of a temperature.
I usually have to take my full size $$$$ hair dryer on vacation because the ones at hotels are wimpy. I decided to research smaller hair dryers & this one looked great. I just tried it today & to my surprise, I liked it!  It dried just as fast as my full size dryer.
Malfunctioned!  Ordered this blowdryer in March 2015 for occasional use at home (I am a guy with short hair - so I barely use it daily).  It malfunctioned only THREE months later in June 2015.  I was drying my hair one morning and flames shot from the dryer at my head - I did not get burned (nor did my hair) but it was pretty surreal to see the dryer nearly on fire.  Unfortunately, they are no longer available - I have no way to contact the seller and so I am stuck buying another dryer. I have included a picture to show the extent of the glowing fire at the end of this dyer.  Buy this Allure hair dryer at your own risk!  If the seller reads this review - I would appreciate being contacted for replacement.  Thanks!
Like it but the cord needs assistance retracting and could have more power.
Wife loves it.
GF brought it and loves it. I am a guy and don't use it myself.
Works like a professional hair dryer should.
good product
Works excellently.  Can easily clean out the air intake grill-work.  Only wish the mounting to the wall plate was more secure.
Nice cheap dryer.
great product for a great value. honestly was worried about the price point at first but it was a good buy :)
Nice, sturdy good quality.  Haven't used it yet but plugged it in and waited a while for it to get hot but had to turn it off before it actually produced real heat.
I got this hair dryer to replace a dryer I had for several years.  This one is really good.  It provides a good flow of air and has 3 different heat settings and speed settings. I would recommend it.
I thought I was buying the same dryer as my old one.  This one takes much longer to dry my hair and the cord is not as long.
It wasn't as I expected.I HAD TO RETURN IT.
perfect
Great price.
My wife and I needed a new hair dryer, and we had good luck with Conair in the past, so I thought I would try this new model which was just introduced.  Works really great, and much much quieter than the old one, too.  Absolutely would recommend it!  5 Stars.
Sending it back.  Blows too hard on high....needs another speed besides low.
Best blow dryer I have ever owned! Loved the solid feel and design!
wow
Bought a new hair dryer a few years ago and it stopped working. Wow they just don't make them like they used to.Previous hair dryer lasted 10+ years.  But this one is wonderful. Noise level is pleasant. Lightweight for this 110 pound girl.Love the heat options. Does a wonderful job. I hope it lasts.
Great dryer
Wife thinks this thing is the best dryer she's ever had!  Claims it drys her hair quickly without leaving all the static. I wouldn't know since I'm bald but I'm glad I bought it for her.
My wife loves it. A great Mothers Day present
perfect for air travel as is compact and fits in my cloth bag-love that it has the diffuser.
I've had this hairdryer for 7 months, and today it died.
Great dryer works fast and has a long cord so you can move around.
This dryer is just what I wanted.
The cord is so short I have to stand at the plug
works great - the 2 nozzles come on and off fine - much lighter than my previous dryer.
Good dryer but the buttons aren't easy to move.
I've never had it in me to buy an expensive blow dryer, so I'm no expert on dryers. But I'm very satisfied with this one. Very powerful and  you can't beat the price
I love it
Good, but ony lasted a year.  Didn't re-purchase, going back to Remington.
Longer than I thought it was from the picture.  Actual dimensions are needed.
Worka well
While the weight is decent. it's not designed well from a hand-use perspective. Also - no cool setting.  Hot air on low and high
Great product! The retractable cord is really nice. The air does not add static to the hair. I wish it came in other color options.
I have long, fine, and straight hair and this has turned out to be my go-to dryer. It gets hot enough but not too hot. It is perfect for styling. Very happy with it.
loved it. broke after a year
excellent great buy
Nice blow dryer so far had about a month blows very strong and gets pretty hot I have long very frizzy hair and blows it straight with a round brush pretty quickly.It's pretty heavy but I don't mind the weight. 4 stars due to nozzle falls off if you don't push it in tight ever time you use it but other than that no complaints.
I love it! It's not as strong as I expected, but my hair dries super fast.
This is by far the best blow dryer I have ever owned.  I have longer thick hair and this dryer cuts my hair styling time in half. Light weight and easy to use. The only thing I would change is maybe the location of the switches. I find myself hitting the switches to easily when styling my hair.
excellent
Great hair dryer and so easy to install.
Good power and nicely styled.
Exactly what I wanted. Excellent dryer.
brush too soft. gave it away.
not 100% as powerful as my old hair dryer, but its so compact and gets the job done.  My hair feels a lot softer and not burnt, so the lower heat seems to be fine.  Ive only had it a month, so I cant say how long the cord retract works.  For $20, if it lasts a year its better than the competition.  I was looking at other hair dryers, and 10$ more, 20$ more-- didnt seem to be much of a difference.  Not until you go to $100+, and when your comparing a 100$ hair dryer to a 20$ one, the 20$ one is the hairdryer to go with.  Update: retractable cord doesn't always fully retract. Still works fine. I would have liked an easier to clean one but this works. I use my shop vac to demolish the lint in the rear fan. For the price it's still a good bargain.
POWERFUL AND NOT EXPENSIVE, IT'S THE PERFECT SIZE,LOVE IT
wife likes it
If I had only known what a difference a hair dryer can make for your hair. I admit that I love to buy beauty products, but especially hair products. My hair is colored/highlighted, fairly straight, but not thin. Lately I keep buying products to take the dry frizz that seems to appear on the ends of my hair. Little did I know that using the Conair Tourmaline Hair Dryer would solve that problem immediately. The dryer has settings for the usual hot/cold/warm settings and high/medium/low...but it's nice to have the controls slide on either side of the device. It's a powerful 1875 watts that dries my hair faster with ions and gives it body plus takes away the dry ends almost 100%. My co-workers noticed my hair looking better too. Ironically, I don't always use a blow dryer because I want healthy hair, but this dryer seems to make my hair look better. For the price and function, I recommended this dryer.
Disappointed - thought it would work on my hair...but made my curly hair straight...with the diffuser!
The wife loves it!...the night light is bright, but not harsh!
First discovered this brand of hairdryer at a hotel that my husband and I stayed at and loved so much that when we got home I went online to find one.  It is made very well, a little more expensive than what you would pay for one from walmart but that was okay with me.  I haven't always had good luck in the past with hairdryers but I think I'll have this Andis for a long time.
Ive had this blow dryer for a little while now maybe a month... great temp and powerful but it whistles and rattles as if something is loose inside...
I like this hair dryer. It has good functions available and it blows good, quiet heat. Although it's a bit heavy to hold..
Works really well. My hair is short but it did what I wanted it to do.  Good investment.
Perfect. Just as described.
I bought this dryer for travel and it is perfect.  Plenty of power and folds upFor easy packing.
This hair drying is great for travel. Perfect size!
Amazing at first. It gave me natural flawless curls but after a month of using it, it stopped working. I had to re-place it.
Good quality and value I love it
Bought this in 2013.  Loved it, worked great.  All of a sudden stopped working.  Contacted seller and they said because it was 2 years ago, they wouldn't replace it.  Not sure I would spend the money again, considering it broke after 2 years.
Excellent 100%
Hair dryer works perfectly HIGHLY RECCOMEND
I purchased this product March 27. It is June 15. The comb attachment started losing teeth after the 3 use. The attachment now has a crack in it. Very upset. The whole reason I purchased this dryer was because of the comb attachment. I am going to try to contact the seller to see if they will replace it. It's too late to return. Also, it's actually melting.
Great Dryer, easy to put on wall. Very Happy with it. Nice nite lite.
Love this dryer.  I specifically chose it because it is not as loud as others.
I only got to use it 1.5 times when I was in the middle of using it the second time when it sparked and burned out.... I would like a refund but don't know how to go about it. I used to have one that lasted for 10 years befo re ti burned out
I purchased this item less than 3 months ago. After using the product for about 4 weeks, I noticed that the handle got incredibly hot...too hot for me to hold without it burning my hand. Today, less than 12 weeks after purchasing, the hair dryer started smoking and completely shut down. Needless to say, I am very disappointed.
Lots of power in this little guy - handle folds if storage is a problem in a drawer or a suitcase.
Just okay....doesnt seem to have a strong blowing power, and the on/off switch is located on the handle right where you hold it which makes it turn off when you are using it. The filter door keeps popping open too....I kept it, but not all that thrilled with it.
Not very powerful and took me longer than usual to dry my hair.
Delivered on time...as described
This is perfect for travel.  It is the smallest dryer I have seen, but it's power is not diminished.
This hair dryer was all it was advertised to be.  It is very easy to use and light weight.
The Elchim dryer is the worst hair dryer I have ever owned.  It is loud, controls are not easy to use, heavy and  no filters.  My current dryer is 10 years old and IS a professional model, much nicer.  I gave this one to our Abused Women's Center.  In asking beauty salons about it I did not find one hair stylist that was familiar with the name or had used it.  DON'T WASTE your money on this one, it is a piece of junk.
Worth the money and good quality no issues
Great product
Favorite hairdryer!
Too loud and the kind of thick! And for the price I would expect more!
Awkward grip on handle, it kinda bugs my finger holding it. Doesn't dry my hair as fast as other blow dryers I've had.
The perfect pink dryer!! I love it! Thank you!
I bought this hair dryer after having it in my hotel room in Disney! I was using it and was really impressed with the speed at which is dried, the fullness of my hair and also the weight of the machine. Love the retractable cord. My hair is very fine and fly-away, especially in the humid weather. My style held even in the Florida heat. So, I came home and ordered one. Love it!
This is a replacement of the same blow dryer that I had purchased based on a recommendation from a magazine. The blow dryer is very light and had good power but failed completely in less than 2 months. I have had the replacement for 3 wks now and there are times the motor slows and I think it too is going to stop completely.
Love this dryer.  I have been looking for this old-style dryer like my aunt used when she was a stylist.  Always loved it great to find one works wonderfully.
good
This hair dryer is fantastic!!  I can dry my hair in half the time it used to take me with my old dryer.  I have very thick long hair and it's so annoying to have to dry it but when I do this is the best one I've ever used.
Work so well we bought two!
Died within 3 months of use every other day.
great quality
Great when traveling. The right size to carry in your luggage.
Works well. Folds easily. Very handy for travel. Had another one for many years and it very stopped working. (Was stolen from our van during a cross country trip.)
Would absolutely buy it again! The highest speed is great! Even though I have short hair I'm sure anyone with long hair would find this dryer quick!
A solid hairdryer.  Not high-end, but perfect for the price.
I have used this for 1.5 years in the salon i like the dryer, actually gets too hot so i rarely use it on high heat, the cold button is placed in a good spot, dryer tends to be a little heavy when using all the time. but it hasn't given me any trouble, over all it was a good buy.
I really like the hair dryer. The cool switch is great. In other hair dryer I had to hold down the cold button. Does its Job.
Excellent
NOT travel size. Works well but heavy and large.
I love this hair dryer. It dries my hair quickly, and my hair dries very smooth and soft. I had an issue with the cord of mine not staying locked, but I was able to easily exchange it for the same hair dryer which did not have the locking problem. Must have been a fluke, but it was very easy to return!
Dries nicely, not too loud. I don't know if I really notice the Nanoe feature's effects compared to my old hair dryer, but I would still buy it again.
Still works great but all the graphics came off within a week. If you have any product on your hands, expect the same results.
Good hairdryer for the price. Some hair dryers really make my color treated hair look dry and frizzy. This one works well with my hair type to keep it looking smoother than the average dryer.
Nice blow dryer.  Comes with a comb too, which is what i needed.  I love it.
Perfect dryer for travel or home use.  Powerful and lightweight.
Not really a travel dryer unless you travel big.
The best hair dryer I have used in 15 years. My hair is thick and unruly. Humidity makes it impossible to do anything but this hair dryer has helped tremendously.
Tended to make my hair frizz instead of curl
works as expected, compact, just what i needed to take to the pool with me
Bought this about a year ago and recently it starting having green sparks inside of it and today it stopped blowing warm air. Very disappointed in the quality. Would not but it again.
Really good quality, l liked it so much l bought 4,
Works great! Hook for cord is a nice plus
Love it!
We were looking for a good quality, simple hair drier. This one seemed to fit the bill.It works well, dries hair quickly, and seems to help tame the Frizzies. We have been using it for quite a while now, and have had absolutely no issues with it.
thanks
Bought this for my wife once her previous (different brand) hair dryer broke. She has been raving about it ever since she got it. I definitely scored some major brownie points with this one. A couple of the things she has mentioned are how quickly it dries her hair in just seconds, how quiet it is while in use, and how fresh her hair feels after each use.
My Wife Really Likes This Dryer, We Would Like Panasonic Extended Warranty!
excellent!
Best blowdryer I have ever owned. Well worth the money!
I love this hair drywr.  At 1600 watts it dries my hair rapidly.  It's compact size makes it lighter and easier to handle than those bulky dryers that must be held foot away from the head.  This is a real plus for folks with arthritis in the shoulder or neck joints. It fits easily into a drawer in the bathroom and it doesn't take up much room in a suitcase for travel.  This is my second hair dryer of this type..  The first one was purchased several years ago, and it still works perfectly even after 4-5 years of nearly daily use.  This unit was purchased as a replacement for a similar 1200 watt dryer (different brand) that I kept in my swimming bag but that finally stopped working after 30 years.
Absolutely love this! Dries hair quickly without burning my hair!
powerful and fast drying
Worked well in Israel with adapter but only on low power despite changing the voltage. I thought I blew it out after only a few seconds on high power. Thankfully it worked on low a few minutes later when it cooled down. OverAll it did the job but def doesn't replace a real blow dryer.
Replaced a like unit which had lasted 6 years
Girlfriend loves it! Not too hot for hwr hair.
does a great job!
Great prpduct for the price
I bought 3 hair dryers at local stores and returned all three -- just not what I wanted.  I kept looking at the Rimini 1800W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic on Amazon -- it was the color that caught my eye first -- that beautiful blue.  After I returned the third dryer, I came back to the Rimini 1800W.  I liked the way the dryer angled down, the controls looked high enough up so I wouldn't be changing the settings, and I especially loved the color!  Well, don't let the color sway you.  I ordered the dryer, and it's fabulous!  It's full-sized, powerful, quiet, and my fingers don't continually change the settings.  It takes me about 4 minutes to completely dry my shoulder-length, straight hair, and that's at medium heat, high power.  I'm so pleased with this hair dryer, and did I mention that I love the beautiful blue color?
I typically never write reviews, but felt compelled to after using this amazing product. My hair has never felt so good after using this dryer. It dries quickly and I barely needed to flat iron my hair when finished. My hair withstood the humidity better than ever as well. My hair is colored (blonde to boot), damaged, wavy and frizzy and it honestly felt like a Pantene commercial after one use! I am a lifer with this hair dryer and thinking of buying a few to have back ups. Thank you Babyliss for making my hair the best it has ever been.
A huge step up from the one it replaced.  Feels solid and works great.
I've had this hair dryer for almost 4 years now, and to this day I love it. I have dry, frizzy, Hermione Granger-esqe hair so I needed something that wouldn't feel like I'm frying it. I highly, highly recommend it to everyone. It comes with a diffuser which I only used like once or twice but it's ok. I'm gonna have this one for awhile, I love the sleek design too, I don't see it becoming outdated like those pink and green hair dryers from the 70s or something. Thanks scientists at Conair, I salute you.
Very nice hair dryer. My favorite thing is that you push down the on/off button and heat controls, you don't SLIDE it as with my last dryer. Important when you are drying hair  for several children and may have lotion on your hands etc....works well, looks good, nice controls. I am happy with it. I don't think it works any differently than my last Ionic hair dryer, in terms of controlling frizz on my naturally curly hair, but it works equally well at a minimum.
Best hair dryer I have ever purchased!  I have always bought the high end expensive hair dryers, but this one far exceeds any dryer I have bought!  Not too hot, light weight and my hair is dryer in 5 minutes less than my last hair dryer!  I'm very happy with my purchase!
Best wall mounted hair dryer I have owned.  Love it!
Because of the placement on the blower, it takes up more space than I anticipated.  It does the job!
I love this hairdryer. Purchased it for a trip abroad but my gym dryer died last week so started using this one and even though it is more compact, it dries my hair quickly. The dual voltage is a plus. Very pleased with the purchase.
Purchased this without much research, so I am to blame for not loving this.  It's heavy, loud and I prefer more ranges in heat than it offers.  The attachments work well.  It's mid-sized, so if you're wanting something light and small, this isn't it.  Mid-sized and heavy......I would not buy again.
My old Revlon dryer died when my hair was half dry, so I quickly drove to the store and spent three minutes picking out this hair dryer. I couldn't be happier. My hair is extremely thick with many layers and takes a long time to dry. The turbo setting allowed me to dry my hair in almost half the time. Even better, the hair's texture was perfect. Shiny and alive, not the texture of straw you get when the hair is over dried.
Great mini dryer with plenty of power. Only problem is that it's loud on high setting.
Bought this hairdryer about a year ago. When I was using it the other morning, it went on and off and went on fire. Needless to say, I am not recommending it.  Never had this happen with any hairdryer I've owned.  No stars doesn't seem to be an option, so it gets one by default.
better price than walmart. can't live without it!
Fits my T3 Micro. Model #53888 R. The barrel of the dryer is slightly less than 2 inches in diameter. Push in and twist, it will latch and stays on perfectly. This is a great value and works well.
It is the 2nd one I have purchased. Love it!
I bought this hair dryer probably 3 years ago and never got around to posting a review. This hair dryer is fantastic- I have had it for 3 years or so and I have never had a problem or malfunction. It drys my hair fast and reduces frizz. I will always buy Elchim.
I thought the button issue that everyone else wrote about would escape me. Nope. Almost every time I dry my hair I hit the temp or speed button... at least 2-3 times. It's does a great job drying but the buttons cause just enough nuance that I would recommend to keep looking. I like it but can't wait for it to break and find a new hair dryer.
love it.
Used item , hair in back of blower , I paid for new item , very disappointed
great dryer (enough power) that i use not just for travel.  only problem is the cord is very short so you have to be fairly close to the outlet when you use it.  if they would make the cord longer, it would be perfect.  i also used it when i was in italy with no problems (although you do need an adapter but the converter is built in).
It took me waaay too long to find a hair dryer that I didn't think was going to start a fire or ruin my hair. I decided on this despite some bad reviews, and am glad that I did. It's pretty (I know this isn't important to some people), and it dries really well. I haven't had any problems with it and love the accessories that came with it.
I have short curly hair that is both course & thick. Was hoping this could replace my hair dryer & diffuser combo and assumed it would be more compact. Unfortunately, this is almost just as bulky and doesn't distribute enough heat to curl/scrunch my hair WHILE simultaneously drying. I would've been better off letting my hair air-dry, which is a horrible look for me. In the process of sending this back.
Blows air way too hot.  It actually burned my hair.  I previously had another blow dryer the same brand and was perfect.  I'm not sure if it's this one that's defective of they just don't make them like before.
I heat style pretty frequently and unfortunately burn out a lot of hair dryers. I haven't invested in a more expensive one and I may not need to. This baby is enduring through my blowouts! The ion technology is fantastic - it leaves my hair soft and smooth! With regular cleaning this has lasted longer than any other one I owned and really is keeping my hair in good shape. It's a great supplemental dryer as well and the coating is easy to grip along with a nice, light weight.
6 months later and the motor is lagging. i keep the vent cleaned to no avail. It's also not that quiet. Revlon makes a much quieter one. Really disappointed.
Great dryer.  Lightweight and easy to handle.  Great heat and cool features.
It is lightweight as promised.  The handle folds up easily.
I actually like this blow dryer very much. It makes my hair very smooth and silky. And I don't have a problem with the settings or placement of the switches, as others have stated. I would recommend this blow dryer to anyone.
A great addition to my hair styling toolbox!  Dries my hair in about 7 minutes.  Love the different settings and the extra part for directing the air to go where you want it.
Wonderful product - excellent service.  Thank you!
It smoothes the fizzies and folds down compactly to store when done.  It has three speeds instead of two, so doesn't blow too furiously at lowest setting, which makes it easier to style my hair (doesn't blow it off of the styling brush).
Good product.
Works just fine!
I have purchased many blow dryers and this one has been my favorite.
No night light on this model - just what I wanted.  It is smaller, so the power is a little lower, but it fits in my small bathroom
Gets my hair dry faster than my old dryer.
Not a lot of power. It takes a lot longer to dry long hair than with other dryers. The brush attachment is also a little too soft for hair straightening.
Fast Shipping! Great product! No issues!
Arrived on time. Not as heavy or as cumbersome to hold while drying hair. It is however, a large hairdryer and not compact for travel purposes. Doesn't dry( frizz) my hair as much as non- ionic dyers. Love all the settings! Several useful attachments were included. You can find a lower price elsewhere without the attachments.
Amazing hair dryer!
Over all great product! It's stylish, light weight, easy to use and hold. Very strong and powerful air power for being such a small blow dryer. You have all the functions like hot and cool, high and low. The black handle has glitter in it and it sparkles in the light lol. All in all this is a great blow dryer and even better price!
It is a good quality product, I have been using it since 2013 and it is working perfectly. However, I do not blow dry my hair everyday, I only use it occasionally.
if your'e looking for a low blow hair dryer, for styling bangs or just for thin hair you should get this.  For thin hair girls like myself, you need a dryer with a more gentle blow in order to get volume.  IF you're looking for a fast dryer, this is NOT it.
Haven't used that often (because it's summer) but the few times that I did there was a burning smell coming from the dryer.  Would not recommend using for long period of time.  Better yet, find another hair dryer for better overall quality and purpose.  Good luck.
Better than my wife's old one. The hair dryer that she had was pretty expensive, but it finally died. I read the reviews on this one and decided to purchase it as a replacement. She loves it. The new hair dryer is quieter and she loves the cool dry feature. Can't beat it for the price and how it works.
Works great, fast shipping, thanks
This hair dryer is worth every penny! I read an article by a top hair stylist who recommended this dryer.  So when my over $100 infrared hair dryer broke after one year, I decided to give this one a try. I'm so glad I did because not only is it light weight, it cut my drying time down, and it helped smooth out my hair. I never knew a dryer could do that, especially when all my other dryers would leave my natural curly hair looking frizzy.
It was damaged in a couple of months, poor quality
Does what it is supposed to do. Could maybe blow air a little stronger but otherwise, a perfectly good hair dryer. Comes with a diffuser and a concentrator (that I will never use...)
LIGHT WEIGHT AND JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF HEAT
This small Conair 1875 will always be my favorite hair dryer. It is compact and easy to handle. I hope they never quit making this model.
works great
It is lightweight & has 3 heat settings.  I love the 2 attachments.
Everyone loves it
Very good
Works great.. very good product
This hair dryer performs exactly as expected and advertised.  I recommend it.
To much noise but does the work.
Perfect
When it works right it is my dream blowdryer.  Yes, thecontrols can easily get flipped around, but the temp andair flow is ideal for those of us with super fine  and fragilecurly hair.  Whatever they are doing to these ion hairdryersis nothing desirable for me.  They always frizz me out.  I use the high heat high speed setting with the hot airpik to straighten and volumize my hair, or use round brushesand vary the heat along each section of hair.  No matter howI style it, I come out with much shinier less frizzy hair.Rewind about 2003-2004: Bought this model in a store,loved it, and used it til it died in about 2007. Boughtanother from a different store.  Everything was fine at first.Then when I would use it the breaker would trip.  At firstit only happened once or twice, which is just one of thosethings that can happen for no good reason.  I bought anotherafter the electrician ok'd everything.  I figured it was just abad dryer.  So I bought one more from a different store.Worked fine until it sparked and a flame came out the end.After a burned hand I decided I should try and find anotherdryer.  Around 2012 I was talking to a friend who works inthe salon industry and she told me the company that mademy favorite dryer had changed the way they made them.That made me think it was worth one last shot.  I have movedfrom where I used all my other dryers.  First couple dries wentgreat.  However, I don't trust it not to use it in a non GFCIoutlet.  Last couple times I used it the GFCI activated andturned it off.  Now I'm convinced it is a safety hazard, orat the very least a challenge the electrical system doesn'tneed.  I'm heartbroken over that.  If the manufacturer couldaddress that problem, I would be SO happy.The seller on Amazon was reasonably priced and got myitem to me quickly and ingood condition.
night light too bright
Very happy with this hair dryer
Does the trick
very good great heat control
I usually cut corners with this stuff. This is still a cheap dryer, but it's very good quality. The matte look is nice, has three settings for heat and three settings for how much air is pushed. Plus the cool button! It's worked great for half a year now. If it broke I'd buy another one!
For an inexpensive hair dryer, this thing was pretty amazing. Lasted almost a year and a half with regular use.
Love the light weight and ease to hold.  Big dryers are too heavy for me.  Good strong blow power and fast drying
This hair dryer will suck your hair into the air intake.
Awesomeness
love love love good for my hair
good
Was not very powerful, was expecting a little more from it.
Works well for my application.
Works as expected fast delivery
I have always bought Conair products in the past, so I never expected this purchase to be problematic.  The dryer works fine, but none of the attachments fit tightly and they fall off with the slightest touch.  It's a huge design error and frustrating as can be.  I would never recommend this product.
Certainly outperforms my current blow dryers. The immediate difference is the drying time. I wouldn't say it halves the time it takes to dry my hair, but it makes a noticeable difference. It's also relatively quieter than my other blow dryers, though as soon as you use the turbo, it gets louder. I certainly wouldn't call it a quiet blow dryer, but it is more comfortable to use. One odd thing, though: it seems to have a lot of suction (it's the only one that sticks to my shirt if I get it too close), but not a very strong air flow output for the amount it seems to be drawing in.4-stars so far because it's about its price; outperforms my current blow dryers but not by a significant margin. I've also read numerous reviews that this doesn't have a great product life, so I'm waiting to see about that.
great item
We love this unit-nite light too!
Great product.  Worked awesome in London and Scotland while using a Universal All in one interantional travel power plug adapter.
The best dryer ever....
I love this dryer. It works great and it is quiet
I bought my first one four months ago and returned it because it was shooting sparks after two months.  I thought it was an anomaly and bought a second one like a ding dong when first one was shot and it caught on F I R E  yesterday...F I R E...really, Revlon?
I love this blow dryer, I love that there is a medium setting!!
I love this small and easy to carry hair dryer, ideal for traveling. I will use Amazon for all my shopping in the future because they provide excellent service.
Already had one. Bought this 2nd one for the other bathroom. Great product.
Purchased to replace an older Conair 1875.  The GFCI plug on this unit failed after 45 days of normal use.In the future I will look for a dryer with a UL safety listing.Too bad Conair is diluting their brand with this junk.
Recently purchased this again to replace a unit in our bathroom that has been there at least 6 years. And ... that unit still runs but the thermocouple switch that shuts the unit off when it overheats has worn over the years and has begun to engage a little too quickly. (Note that not keeping the lint filter clean will cause this issue as well, due to restricted airflow over the thermocouple).Indeed, a pretty darn good unit for the money. After a couple of years of use (literally, used hundreds of times in that period) the ears or fingers that hold the dryer became worn, or loose, so the hairdryer would fall out. This was solved by placing a strip of Velcro on the inside of each ear.  Would have given product 5 stars if this had not occurred. Found that this easy repair needs to be repeated every couple of years.From my experience, definitely would not hesitate to recommend. Conjecture is that those who experienced short life with this appliance may not have cleaned the lint filter as often as required. From personal experience I know it's easy to put this little chore off. If you have had this product only a few months and you start experiencing the unit shutting off before your hair is dry - this is the thing to check.
Love it! The power, the light weight, the settings & especially easy to pack because it folds up! I have fibromyalgia and my hands sometimes will not let me hold things. The grip on this is easy & it's light weight so it doesn't hurt to hold it when drying my hair.
I picked this up on lightening deal as I needed a new blow dryer. It's as good as my last conair but a bit less powerful - which is fine for me because I couldn't use the highest setting on my last one since it blew my hair to much - I have fine hair so it just tangled my hair on the highest setting. I love the retractable cord!
It's so nice!
Excellent hair dryer !!!!
Less than two years of use and this thing just stopped working. Aggravating!
Been using this twice daily for over a year. Simple, effective. You don't really need anything more than this to make wet hair dry. My dog would probably give it a 1 star review, but he is biased because he hates hair dryers in general.
Works very well on my hair. One thing that stinks, though, is that the concentrator piece on the end of the hairdryer comes off every now and then and it can become very annoying.
Very loud and sounds like an afterburner out of an F-16. Blows hot and cold.
Do not buy this dryer!  After using it for less than one week, the handle would become so incredibly hot I could barely hold on to it.  I noticed that the protective covering had started to dimple and come apart. I continued using it being very careful where I put my hand on the handle. Now, after less than one month, it quit working all together. It shut off after smelling very hot and will not turn back on.  Junk!
Had this product for several years and wore it out. Sure glad it was still available. Does the job better than most.
Excellent dryer!  I would recommend it to everyone
This is a very well built little dryer and works well.
It's a tad heavier than I would like but I love the retractable cord and the fact that it folds and fits easily in my vanity drawer. It does a great job.
Excellent. Great Value. I love to retractable cord- folding aspects of this dryer. I put I'd away neatly in a drawer / out of sight .
Great price for an adequate hair dryer.
Great diffuser
Used this hair dryer in England last month. It worked fine with the adapter. My problem with this hair dryer is that even on the low setting the air from the dryer is too hot. I dry my hair in sections and I could hardly get a section dry before my scalp would start to burn.
This blowdryer works well although not as powerful as the Revlon one I am replacing this with.  It dries my hair in a fair amount of time but I miss being able to hold onto the hairdryer and being able to turn it on and off one handed.  The curved handle on this does not allow you to do this.  Other than that I like it and I like the retractable cord although the cord could be a tad longer.
Awesome
Bought for my Mother, and it does what it is supposed to do.
good hair dryer!  10mins to dry my long hair ! I am so happy
Purchased the Onei MK-II to replace my wigo. After purchasing a Chi & Sedu I was hesitant to purchase the Onei. This by far has surpassed my expectations & my experience with the Chi & Sedu. I need a hairdryer to meet my needs: dry without loss of volume & decrease amount/use of root/shine styling products. Very surprised at how gentle the air flow comes out & how fast my hair dries.  I assume it's based on the barrel shape of the Onei dryer vs a more cylindrical barrel like some dryers. The packaging of the dryer far exceeded my expectations. The quality of the Onei feels/looks better than the sedu I purchased months ago. So far very surprised & looking to see if this will outlast my last dryer a wigo(5yrs).  I have had this dryer for only a month & have not heard of this brand before. That's why I only gave it a 4. So far loving it better than the Sedu & Chi.
Ionizes and retracts. It has great power.
OMG, I have been looking for this dryer for at least 5 years!  After my favorite dryer broke, I looked for one like it that is lightweight, has power but not too much power, and most importantly, has the high/low/off switch on the BACK of the dryer handle, not in the front.  All of the dryers I have looked at in the past have the switch(es) on the front of the handle.  This is a problem for me, because when I style my hair with a dryer and a round brush, I have to constantly turn the dryer on and off.  With the buttons on the back of the handle like this one, I can turn it on and off with one hand.  When the buttons are on the front of the handle, I have to set my brush down to turn it on and off with two hands.  What a hassle!  This lightweight dryer with the on/off switch on the back of the handle fits the bill perfectly.  I will probably buy another one as a back-up for when this one wears out.  I highly recommend this dryer, and you can't beat the price!
Good!
These little dryers are just great in my room and the guest room. Small enough to be out of the way but plenty of power to dry my thick hair.My guests love them
Great service. I just wish that I had realized that the barrel is so long. My wife has a short arm  and has difficulty using the dryer.
Bought the leopard version of this blow dryer because of the cheaper price and I LOVE it. It is a great blowdryer and I would recommend it to every hair stylist. UPDATE: now 7-8 months later my blowdryer is broken. I really loved this blowdryer but mine just stopped work and only blows cold air now. Very disappointing.
I like the warm and cool feature! Diffuser attachment an added bonus
Replacement dryer for the original one I broke. Love it.
It works OK. Easy to use. Nothing special about it.  It says for salon use but, it would take to long to dry Salon hair. I had a salon use blow dryer and it dried my hair much faster but the price was around $200 to replace it.  so, for the price of the MHD dryer it works just fine. It just takes longer.
Great dryer!!! The directions were not made for people who have no idea what they are doing, so it tooke about a month or so to actually put it together!!  But I got it and I love it. I would just say, put in better instructions to follow.
as expected
excellent
This thing is a miracle worker. My curls have never look bigger and bouncier!
I bought this hair dryer because it's dual voltage and I needed something for a trip to Italy.  It worked wonderfully in Europe.  And it's working great at home too.  Nice and powerful.
very happy with the unit.
Works very well. You only have to be careful with lid which is much thinner than the lower half.
Fantastic product.. Save time each morning with this amazing product
I purchased this hair dryer on February 27th. The heating element stopped working on June 3rd (so it worked for only 3 months.) It will blow air, but not hot air. Returns not allowed after 30 days.
I really like this hair dryer! Although it's a bit heavy on my hands as I'm using it, it leaves my hair looking shiny and smooth with minimal frizz. It also dries my hair efficiently and quickly. Highly recommend it and it's at a great price!!
This sounds weird, but the night light is MUCH TOO BRIGHT.  I had to tape something over it to mute the light.  The mounting bracket is tricky to install and kind of flimsy too
A little heavy on the hand but works well.
I wish this one had the Ionic feature that my other one has, which seems to dry my hair a lot faster, but still a great compact dryer that is a great addition to my bathroom!
Was tired of hair dryers that died after 3 years so I purchased this.  It died after 4 MONTHS!  the heating element broke.  Very disappointed.----6/10/2015 update... Called customer service and they sent a replacement within a few days!  Fabulous!  Still disappointed the dryer died so quickly but with this kind of company backing up their products, I definitely wouldn't hesitate to buy from them again!
Changed my drying time.  Great product
great product
Got this for my mom, who wanted a dryer with a strong blow. I have a Remington that is great (but that model is no longer available), so I got her this one based on other positive reviews, and she really likes it.
Works just as well as a full sized hair dryer even though it is the size of a toy!!
processed hair benefits GREATLY from salon deep conditioning and this is a great home alternative. gets super hot if you need it, also allows home hair coloring that requires heat.  love it.
This is the best dryer.  Does not burn your hair  And dries it very quickly
Size and heat output is a great combo
This was a gift for my wife.  It has worked flawlessly for months now.  Great product.
Not as good as the one I had 10 years ago. The old one was a better quality and this make hair a little frizzy
Excellent.
My teen age son was leaving his previous dryer laying on the sink.  Sometimes the cord would be IN the sink!  This freaked me out a bit so I ordered this wall unit.  This was easy and quick to install.  I love it!  My son loves it!
This hair dryer died within 4 months of buying it. Waste of money.
Does not blow hard enough for me. Bought a different brand and it works great!
Love, love, love this little hair dryer! I got it because it tucked into my smallish bathroom cabinet but was pleasantly surprised how well it worked. It has at least as much power as the full size dryer I am replacing. I haven't missed the old one for a minute. Plus, as promised, this has a very compact size that makes storage and travel easy.
Very easy purchase. Dryer works great. Totally satisfied customer.
Received exactly when promised. Product is exactly what I was looking for and met or exceeded expectations.
This hairdryer is the best I have had!!!  It is much better than even my $125 hairdryer.
This is now my favorite hair dryer. I use it every day. It's so light my wrist doesn't get tired.
This dryer does the job, but it's a little loud, and it doesn't seem to get as hot as my last dryer.  It takes a little longer to dry my hair, but at the price I paid, it was still a good value.  I've had it for many months and it still works fine.
I bought this little dryer from another vendor. Normally it takes me a good 40 minutes to get my hair mostly dry and I air dry the rest with quite a bit of frizz. This little hair dryer is very lightweight, comfortable to hold and dried my hair nearly complete after just 5 minutes with no frizz. I returned it.The problem is, this is literally the loudest hair dryer I have ever come across. Really loud. I felt like I had hearing issues for about 15 minutes afterward. Granted I have severe migraines and am super sensitive to noise. I love the job it did, I just wish it did it more quietly. I could not imaging turning this on while traveling, camping, staying at someone's house. Too bad
Dries as it should with aesthetic looks.
I waited 6 mos to write this review because I wanted to be sure it atleast lasted that long. This thing is perfect for home use. I use it on myself and my daughter. roller sets come out perfect. twistouts dry in half the time wash and go's have less shrinkage because the gel cast sets faster. I'm so glad i ordered this product. It is top heavy when you try and roll it I support the bottom and top as I push but it mainly stays in one spot. The bell can be a bit startling but mainly because you tune out the sound of the dryer so when the timer goes off you've forgotten what you were doing. i dont find it necessary to crank the heat all the way up, at mid range my hair is dry in about 40min. In Short... I love this dryer and if anything happened to it I would gladly purchase again. I ordered my dryer the week of Christmas it was on my doorstep the next day
The dryer blows cold air on US settings! Worthless unless you're traveling abroad!
Works perfectly.
Excellent product
Buyer beware!  I have owned this hair dryer less than 9 months.  While drying my 5 year old daughter's hair it shut off.  We thought we just needed to reset it on the plug.  After doing that and turning it back on we heard a loud snap.  It burned through the cord near the handle and left black marks on my husband's hand.  Thank goodness my daughter wasn't hurt.  What a dangerous piece of garbage.
Being a guy I never saw a need for a hair dryer, but recently I found it gives me a ton of volume (Duh). This is a great buy and the attachment works wonders during styling. Not to mention, if you are a hairy guy, it makes the drying process of the rest of your body a lot easier!
Really good dryer but now its seriously overpriced. Bought ours on Amazon in March for only $32. Totally worth every penny, however totally NOT worth $200. Not sure where the price increase came from.....
Better than my old one. This gets the job done faster and a lot quieter.
I read the reviews on this hair dryer and decided to give it a try. Going on a big trip and definitely needed a small travel size dryer. This hairdryer is amazing for its size.  I have fine hair but a lot of it and this thing works great great, it's amazing for its size how much power it has. I have a very expensive Ionic ceramic dryer and this thing dries my hair just as well. I've actually even started using it on an every day basis and for the price you cannot go wrong!
It drys my hair quickly and isn't too large or heavy to use. I wish it had a hanging loop on th handle , and it is a little on the noisy side
Great product and amazing price!!!
I know there have been a lot of positive reviews on this hairdryer but the one that I purchased just blew up.  Purchased in February of 2015 and can no longer use it in the end of May 2015 (three months).  My girlfriend and myself were using it daily for the three months but I would think it would last longer than that.  Trying to reach out to the manufacturer now to get replaced but this is a hassle that I don't want to deal with.If we get it replaced, I'll change my rating
Everyone that comes over comments: “WHERE did you get a hotel hair dryer! I WANT ONE!!!” it works great, I use it every single morning and also with some craft projects. it’s easy to use and i love love love how you just shove it in it’s holster (like slamming an old telephone haha) very satisfying because it turns OFF when you put it in its home. Love that about it. I also like the position of the grip.I mounted mine onto tile with two 3M heavy duty adhesive strips so we didn’t have to drill holes. It’s holding up well and when it is time to take it off, you just slide the base off it’s mount and work with it directly. Great buy
Works great. My wife really liked it for Mother's Day. Its dries her hair faster than her old one.
Light too bright
This hair dryer is light, quiet, and best of all, the cord swoops right up into the body of the dryer with the push of a button. I love, love, LOVE this feature.
The bonnet is not quite big enough for large rollers, so the heat does not circulate well.  I'm still looking for the old-fashioned hat box dryers that I had in the 60's.
Love it!!!! I've had it for couple of months now. Definitely recommend it.
Great
This is the WORST hair dryer that I have ever had. The one that Andis quit making, and I guess replaced it with this thing, was SOOOOOOO much better than this punny thing. Anything can blow harder than this one, it's terrible. The nozzle (I guess that's what you call it) anyway where the air comes out is so big around, what little air that comes out goes everywhere and you can't style your hair with it. Seems as though when a company comes up with a good product and it sells good, they can't stand it, and then they come up with something in it's place that is terrible and they think people should except their stupidity for making such a mess of things. I have had Andis wall hair dryers for years and loved them but, this one is the poorest excuse for a hair dryer that I have ever had!!!!!! Thank You,Louise Bell
Very good hair dryer. Mounting bracket works very good.
Worked great until it broke 8.5 months in.
I shopped around for a blow dryer and was about to buy one for well over 100 dollars when I came across this one... so I thought I would give it a chance.  I am happy to say that I love it.  The chord is nice and long, the buttons are easy to set and do not sit in an area where they are in the way.  The cold shot button must be held down but it shoots out a nice cold blast of air to help set your hair.  The hot setting is super hot but I am sure works well with thick hair.  I mostly use the medium heat without any damage.
I hairdresser recommended this blow dryer to me she said it was the strongest and best she has ever used, she was right.  I'm pretty sure they use this blow dryer in the movie Twister to make the tornadoes.
Super product!
my roommates couldn't keep their hands off this
Great hair dryer! It's the perfect size and drys your hair quickly!
Vickie loves it ,
love everything about it
send it back did/t work
I love this hair dryer.  I have had 3.  Every time one stops working, I buy another one.  It makes my hair look and feel great.
Just the right size and power for travel.
its fine
Perfect! Good power.
Small but packs some serious heat and power!
Heats great, love the ergonimical style
I love this hair dryer
Works great
I work for a salon that provides you with everything but your shears and I HATED the blow dryer they provide. I went to Cosmoprof and saw that this model was on sale and I decided to give it a shot thinking if I hate it I can always trade it in and get something else and since this was one of the more expensive models I'd get a small refund as well.The first client I had I noticed a huge difference, no frizzy hair and it does the job in half of the time than my other blowdryer. (Also, to fellow cosmetologists, I recommend the power styler from Daroko to use with your blowdryer)This is definitely a case of you get what you pay for. This blow dryer is worth the money. If you are ok the beauty industry this is a great investment.
LOVE this hairdryer!! I keep getting compliments on my hair lately and the only thing I've done differently is to start using this blow dryer (with no cut or professional styling in months)! The small diffuser was a tight fit at first, but the more I've used it, the easier it's gotten. I guess the little tabs had to be rubbed down a bit. Never had a problem with the curling diffuser. 2 months in and am satisfied so far!
I sent it back.  Basically not worth it.  Heavy - cord did not retract all the way -- not what I was looking for.
Good product
Works fine but at their higher price no longer a good buy
This hairdryer does not get very hot. On high heat it blows warm/cool on the low blow setting. Even on the high heat and high blow setting it is only warm.  It takes longer to dry my hair with this than my 10 year old Panteen hair dryer. No reduction in frizz. I bought this on amazon but I saw this exact hairdryer at dollar general for $15.  It is ok. I wouldn't buy it again.
fit my old wall mount - works great!
The mounting screws that screw the base to the mounting plate are really tiny and flimsy. One of the two screws stripped its thread right away when it was being slightly tighten. It's a shame that a good product fails for something so simple.
this product did not work at all, it seems to be newand fine but never went on
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT. Very strong wind and make my hair dry much faster. can't live without it,
Love it
Hard to flex into position.
This hair dryer left my hair a tangeled mess each time I used it.  I will be returning and going back to a conair or revlon hair dryer.
The best hair dryer.  In fact this was a replacement for the one I had for ten years
Works great,gave me my independence back.
I read the reviews and decided to try this.  Maybe BaByliss spoiled me I dunno. My hair is way too dry and doesnt hold its shape. Returning and sticking with BaByliss.
Love this
Love it!  Does not frizz out my hair at all in fact it smooths it really well and gives me that just went to the salon look.
This is my second Andis wall mounted hair dryer, which replaced one that was over 5 years old.  Of course, the wall mount feature is the best for keeping a clutter-free countertop, but I also appreciate that it is quiet and has the power to dry my hair quickly.  (I have thick, shoulder length hair.)
The on/off and heat selector buttons are not toggle or rocker switch like other ones it seems to wobble when operated and feel it might not last as long as others.  I do not use often but others in family will.  Will have to see how it wears.
just like we use when we travel (Mariott uses these)
Very good product!
Good hair dryer!
Great for speed drying and traveling.
Love it.
Makes me hair smooth and dries my hair quickly. Love it.
Quietiest Hair dryer that we've ever owned.  Very powerful, drys quickly and efficiently.  Love this hair dryer!
Nice product, but never got the diffuser it was supposed to come with.
Doesn't fold!!!!!
I absolutely love this dryer! The buttons are easy to use, the concentrator nozzle keeps my hair smooth and it dries in half the time! I would buy this again!
Wife didn't really like it. Wasn't impressed. Works fine though.
Overheats REALLY easy :( It is light, small, cute and works ok apart from that... I would also prefer the tip thinner
Great product quiet like I've never experienced I forget it's on if I walk away from it! LolGets really hot so be careful to adjust or sit low ..best dryer ever and I've owned 7
I’m better impressed with the Curlipops Diffuser Dryer than I was with my deceased Conair Curl Fusion Ionic Ceramic Styler Hair Dryer (next to current generation) which the Curlipops is replacing for me. Both dryers have negative ionic technology, which makes them preferable to the free hairdryers at hotels, the gym, and my therapy pool, as I always notice much more frizz when I use those dryers than when I use my own. So, in that regard, they’re both preferable IMO.Unlike the Conair, the Curlipops allows you to position the diffuser the way you want to, and for me that’s so that there aren’t large gaps between the dryer fan and your hair. It may be that I have a heightened sense of safety awareness, after working in health care for 38 years, but the Conair’s clipping on in a way that kept the gaps as wide as possible didn’t give me a whole lot of confidence that it would work well for “pixiecurling.” For those who don’t know, this is a method of drying curly hair, developed by someone who goes by “pixiecurl” on naturallycurly.com, in which you scrunch your hair into the bowl of a dryer’s diffuser with the dryer off, turn it on and dry that section of hair, then turn it off before repositioning the dryer: because the dryer isn’t on when you do the scrunching, curls stay better defined, but another factor is that your hair isn’t being pushed away by airflow when you’re positioning the dryer, only possibly an issue with a pancake style dryer. I was still too chicken to try it with pixiecurling, but used the method Jessica McGuinty (of Jessicurl) uses in her hair drying video &#60; and it worked great! My hair dried a lot faster, curled really well, and I had no problems with frizz as it finished drying. Although it’s a little difficult to attach initially, the diffuser works really well, and that’s no biggie since I have no reason to keep removing and reattaching it, it just resides on the dryer. So one for Curlipops.It has three heat settings: cool, warm, and hot, which are independent of the airflow speed, as well as having a cool shot button. I don’t use high speed because it disorganizes my curls. I’m also unlikely to use hot, but it’s nice to have the option of finishing with cool air without having to hold the cool shot button down for an extended period of time. The Conair has Hi, Off, and Lo, along with a cool shot button, so airspeed and heat, or lack thereof, are connected to each other, and I score another one for the Curlipops.Whine: the Conair has it in spades, and the Curlipops has very little. So I give this one to the Curlipops too.Both dryers are listed as having the same weight, according to Amazon, though that’s really the shipping weight. It’s a little more than I’d like, considering I have fibromyalgia, and I don’t need any help making my arms and shoulders ache, but it’s still better than getting hypothermia, pneumonia, or bronchitis. Also, not having the dryer permanently attached to a wall means I can get into more comfortable positions while drying my hair. Both still weigh less than my mother’s non-ionic, folding, travel dryer, which I used once while I was moving her, then abandoned due to the abundant halo of frizz it created. So score one for both pancake dryers. However, neither one has dual voltage, and the Curlipops’s instructions specifically state it should not be used with a voltage converter, so it would not be a possible choice for travel outside of North America.Curlipops.It has three heat settings: cool, warm, and hot, which are independent of the airflow speed, as well as having a cool shot button.

Great product
Good product, but cord is short.
Great dryer! Lighter weight and less damaging than my old one. This is being picky, but I wish the switched the positions of the power and heat setting buttons. I hold the dryer in my left hand and the brush in my right (do other righties do this?). My left thumb is closest to the heat setting button (that I never change) and farther away from the on/off switch (which I use between every section of hair. The result? Accidentally switching the hear setting to blast furnace and burning my scalp. Conair, one little change, please!
Nice blower.
This dryer is amazing! It works better than the shop dryers. It's super quiet besides the timer tick but even the tick is less noisy than the shop dryer..me and my clients can carry on a conversation and they can enjoy watching t.v. This dryer exceeded my expectations in all areas and it was also very easy to assemble. The shipping was also awesome it arrived within 3 days from ordering it. I recommend this dryer to anyone.
I have thick hair and this baby gets my hair dry quickly and WITHOUT frizzies! Love it!
This dryer is so light weight!! I was amazing by that. It is perfect for what I needed.
Does what it is supposed to. A noted design flaw... the hose connector to the bonnet does not couple well, or rather stay connected. I suggest that you shove the male hose part into the female bonnet part, without using the notches. It may permanently attach the tow so you can no longer use the brush or detach them, but it will keep the two secure.  Also it kind of smells weird when on.
Bought dryer for my daughter it isn't hot enough for me but awesome for my 10yr old to dry her thin/fine hair with
Fits a need, but not as nicely made as the model it replaced. The base is all molded plastic and is not really integrated with the hair dryer. What I mean is that there are two notches cut in to the plastic base and the hair dryer cord is run through the notches with some rubber grommets used to hold the cord in place.There are not a lot of alternative products to choose from and on the plus side it was relatively cheap and easy to install.
I have very thick and coarse hair and this is the best hairdryer I have owned until now! It gets my hair dry so fast, and the end results are smooth and frizzless hair. With other hair dryers it takes anywhere from 25-35 minutes but this one literally takes 7-10 minutes plus adds more volume to my hair.The heat settings are perfect as well in case someone doesn't want to add too much heat to your hair .. Every dryer I have ever owned did pretty much all the same things but at the end made my hair frizzy and dried my hair out. This dryer is THE ONLY ONE that makes my hair look so beautiful, sleek, soft and shiny! It makes my hair so smooth that I almost don't have to flat iron it since it is naturally wavy. Freakinglyyy amazing!!
Good merchandise for the price. A++
Great power, compact shape, easy to use. This is for my regular daily use because the small size fits under my sink but is powerful enough to blow out my hairstyle every day.
I got this as a gift to my mom and she love it !!!!
SUPER tiny but works great. Perfect for weekend trips away from home and small enough to toss in a bag and take to the gym. Not terribly noisy either. I wish it had a medium heat setting but other than that, I can't complain.
I love it. No more clutter in the bathroom.
I like tha it has the hot and warm heat adjustment.  Works great.
Of the two blow dryers that I own, this attachment fits neither.
Bad smell come out.
Great hairdryer!
My favorite hair dryer, powerful, totally recommended!
A lot of power.  Heavier than some hair dryers that I have previously owned.  Doesn't get as hot as I would like it to, but still styles your hair effectively.
Good value I am very happy.
I bought this from Amazon warehouse deals, so it was a few dollars cheaper. The only thing it didn't have was a box. Everything else was there, and working. There was no damage to the item itself.This hair dryer runs a bit quieter and smoother than my previous one, and has both the concentrator and diffuser, and cold shot, so I'm set. It's light too, so if you spend a lot of time using it your wrist and hand won't get as tired.Great buy for the price. Better than the $30 one I bought at Sally Beauty.
So this blow dryer has a purple hint of color just an fyi and love it. I used it for the first time because my other blow dryer would cause a lot of split ends, instantly. So I used it for the first time and no split ends, yay!. I also did use another blow out product with this blow dryer which you should try to prevent split ends. I use the RedKen Satinwear Blow dry Lotion before I start blow drying and both combined work wonders. Your hair will look like you just came out of the salon.
This is actually a pretty darned good blow dryer for the price.  Just wish the cord was longer.
good product
Work well and has great heat. I can dry my hair very fast
Love the hot pink!  Different speeds and heat settings are fantastic.  Re-tractable cord works well.
THE BEST HAIR DRYER EVER! My children are biracial so I have to find products that can accompany their individual hair textures. My daughter has coarse thick hair whereas my son has thin straight hair. This dryer works for both of them efficiently. Works FAST! Don't need a flat iron for my daughter since this gets it pretty straight while drying. Cuts time in half. Bought based on good reviews and I now Highly recommend it myself!  Try it and you'll never want a different hair dryer.
I love the amount of air it produces and the multiple heat and blow settings!
This is a very decent little hair dryer: very inexpensive, two speeds and heats, but it packs punch for its size. I wish it were some other color (not a huge fan of pink), but I am very satisfied with this purchase.
bigger than I expected , doesn't fit in my drawer.  but the product itself works great.
Very good for the price. Gets super hot so you have to be careful.
Would have preferred a stronger airflow
Love this hair dryer. It dries my hair faster than others and makes my hair soft.
Exactly what I was looking for! Here's hoping it lives a long and service-oriented life.
Best hair dryer I have ever owned!
Absolute bargain of the century! My wife had two Chi's break in the course of around five years. While most would argue that 2-3 years is adequate - when one pays $100+ for a hairdryer, you expect to see many long years of service. Instead of sinking another hundo into what is just a high priced Chinese made hair dryer, we took a gamble on the Herstyler Pro. The result? My wife is 101% pleased - really. FIt and finish is as good as the Chi. Logical button placement and function is perfect. Temps are ideal, force is great and the whole hairdryer feels like a salon professional. They could double the price and it would still be a steal. VERY well done. I like it so much, we are buying a second to stick on the shelf if the first ever gives up the ghost.
Much smaller than anticipated - not sure what they measured for the dimensions. It is also fairly weak if you have thicker hair.
Would give zero stars if allowed. The day it arrived, took it out of the box, plugged in and nothing. Just a big puff of smoke that smelled awful. Unplugged and it continued to smoke. Very disappointed in this. Thought I have found a trusted manufacturer and decently priced hair dryer. Back it went for return.
Good
Bought this for my daughter.  She loves it, except there is no diffuser but she has managed.
Love it. Not to hot, drys my hair quickly and my hair looks fab. What more could I ask for. I'm glad I did not get one of the more pricey dryers.
Works very well and fast. I have medium long wavy hair. It looks very healthy after blow drying without even any product. I am saving a lot by not having to use products in my hair anymore.
Very good quality product for good price
Perfect
This thing had sparks coming out of it, so I called Panasonic and they said that these were made for use in Japan. They say 100Volts on them. Look at all your other hair dyers and electrical appliances. They usually say 120V or 125V.I've copied and pasted this from a blog where someone asked if you can use Japanese appliances in the U.S.: Can you use Japanse appliances in the US?I am an electrical engineer. My expert opinion is I would stay away from using any appliance that generates heat...such as a hairdryer (as previously mentioned) or a kotatsu or a boiler for tea water...unless you know what you are doing!!Japan's electrical system is roughly the same as the US's. However, the US's voltage is 120Vac RMS (60Hz)while Japan's is 100Vac RMS (50 or 60Hz depending on region).So, any heat generating device from Japan that is used in the US will get 20% hotter than it's design intended. The risk is damage to the device and/or fire...or injury of a person. Please be careful!!That being said, you could use a transformer for such devices if you really must have them. But, heat generating devices are usually pretty high wattage...meaning you'd need some pretty hefty transformers to do the job.We do have another of these dryers that's a slightly different model that hasn't sparked, but knowing what I know now, I wouldn't buy another.I've put a link below to a similar dryer that's Conair brand that we've bought before and which is what I'm replacing this unit with. There may be other brands; just look for hair straightening dryer or something like that.
I have had a couple of these over the years.  They've been great.  Lasted a long time.  Easy to mount.  Great night light too.
Great dryer, easy to hold, made really well, drys hair in no time at all
My old blow dryer broke and I needed a quick replacement.  The price seemed reasonable and it was a quick delivery.  The hair dryer is flimsy and the nozzle continues to fall off from day one.  I never had the time to pack it up and send it back. Bad me for not returning it.
Amazing value!
Very nice hairdryer. Wishing the size is smaller though.
Great little travel dryer.  Super strong for the size!
I use this to style my epic beard. It is great. The only down side I can thik of is the attachment only fits this hair dryer. This is a great hair dryer at a great price.
It dries so fast it is great! I had brought one over from France that my mom had gotten years and years ago but unfortunately I was never able to get the same power due to the voltage difference. I ordered this one and it is the same to the T (except color). Cut down my hair routine in half.It does fume and heats up A LOT so be careful!(I have black relaxed hair)
Purchased several of these a few years ago. Gave one as a gift and my wife kept one. She loved hers, so when she recently gave it to our daughter she bought this one as a replacement. My wife likes the size, power and temperature of this hair dryer and rates it 5 stars.
Best hair dryer I've used. Light weight and dries hair fast.
Love it, lots of power and drys my hair quickly
Used this dryer during a recent trip to Europe.  So easy to use in different countries and compact to carry. Couldn't ask for a better, more efficient dryer.  I even used it to warm cold food in my hotel room, but don't tell anybody.
Works well
Works beautifully and fast.  Lots of heat choices.  Hot is hot with this dryer.  I had to wear a terry headband around my forehead, ears, neck because of the leakage of hot air, but otherwise, it dried my curly hair very quickly, almost as fast as at the salon.  Love the thin case and the way the power cord, bonnet and air hose store in the case.  I worried about where I'd store this in a small apartment, but it's no problem.
Great deal. Love it except it is a little heavy.
Works great and keeps my daughter from borrowing my wife's all the time.
Good product. Received quickly. As expected.
Dries my hair quicker than my older one.  A little heavy though
My wife really liked this product it's good
Great product, fast delivery and reasonable price! Highly recommended!
I've had this blow dryer for about six months. It dries, it's strong, but I keep smelling a slight burn scent and I feel like it's just about ready to bite the dust. I don't really even blow dry my hair that often. Also, it claims to be ionic but my hair is totally frizzy after using it, so it seems like just a buzz word on this product. You get what you pay for. I'll be shopping for a more quality product.
Underpowered.
This is our second wall mounted hair dryer and I can see some improvements in the design.  We are very happy with its performance.
I know everyone has said this dryer is awesome blah blah blah. I normally love Andis products, but this has ended their winning streak with me. I purchased this for deep conditions and to style my hair roller sets, twists etc. This bonnet is so small it only fit on my 7yr olds head and that was a tight fit. I really tried to make it work but after I knocked all my pink rollers loose, everyone got a hearty laugh I gave up.  don't know if they used small models for the design or maybe I need a plus size head bonnet either way it was a return for me.
Super powerful and versatile!
WHY IS THIS ITEM GETTING SUCH BAD REVIEWS ?!?!? I HAVE THIS BLOW DRYER IT'S THE ONLY BLOW DRYER THAT REALLY WORKS ON MY HAIR & DOESN'T BREAK OR BLOW OUT WHILE DEALING WITH MY THICK HAIR. I ONLY WISH THE COMB WAS MORE STRONGER & IT CAME IN PINK :)  OTHER THAN THAT NO COMPLAINTS !!!
Why does this little compact travel dryer work better than my bigger more expensive hair dryer? Which I've put away in the guest bathroom. This is a great little dryer. I wish it had a quick cool shot button, but I wouldn't avoid buying it for that reason.
works really well.
I've only used this for a couple of weeks, but so far has met my expectations.  Just installed a new handicapped shower, mounted this just outside the shower above a GFI receptacle.  it does a great job both drying me off, and drying the many shelves in the shower which hold water. My soap now stays dry and firm, and my bath mat doesn't get waterlogged.Best feature - The magnet which holds the dryer in the cradle. Most plastic latches fail after a few months, but the magnet should be bulletproof. I also like the long cord which reaches to the end of my 5 foot shower. If one doesn't have a backer board I recommend Molly anchors to mount the dryer metal bracket.
Awesome product but did not give 5 stars because it didn't last long before it started giving problems. For the money paid, expected the product to hold up longer.
Good
this blow dryer is very powerful and does the job.
Love this hair dryer!!
None
This works well.Very gentle and it makes my hair smooth.Bought it for a few months and works well.
Dry's  well and is small enough to pack for travel.
very good and i love it!
Junk. Hard to clean and it took a long time to dry. Other retractable hair dryers can be had for about the same price. Started to get a rattling sound inside of it with a burnt smell. lasted under a year.
Not as hot as the dryer it replaced, but I adapted.  The retractable cord is a wonderful feature.
So far it is working lovely! It dries my hair very fast though it does not have the changing voltz feature I like it! Is a little heavy but you can see it is of good quality! Hope electric accident won't happen.
great dryer.
Doesn't seem to be hot enough, but I like the power!
It is the right size, not to big for the bathroom and with a lot of power
The brush is much to soft...doesn't really serve a purpose.
works great!  Just a little heavy.
This is a powerful and very hot dryer if that's what your looking for. But it's heavy, really long with the concentrator on it, AND LOUD!!! Holy crap I'm going def
good for rv's
I love the number of options this dryer gives you as far as heat and intensity. The attachment is smooth and the dryer is quiet. Good purchase.
This is the best blow dryer.
Very powerful and the low heat setting is definitely low heat... most blow dryers low setting seems to be more hot than low.
Takes up very little space.  Has a nightlight.  Very powerful.
Multiple settings, light, and easy to use
My hair has never been better!!!
It's a good  hair dryer for the price. It's light weight and you still get the benefits fr om a full side hair dryer. The lettering on the handle did rub off within  a week but that's not a big deal for me. Overall I'm pretty happy with my purchase.
very disappointed- i have bought this exact product about 5-6 times over the last 8 years- it was awesome- great heat great weight attractive-etc. but the last 2 i ordered from amazon the plug in design changed and it fits to loosely into the wall socket- and sparks- which is scary- i love the hair dyer itself- but the new design of the plug in is faulty- what can be done?????
My old dryer was not putting out any heat. That was why I bought this one. It does not put out as much air as my old one, but it does a good job of drying my hair.
Had the blow dryer for several months now... no problem does not over heat.... best investment
Love this dryer. Professional results without the price!
great
Better than expected- really great value to price ratio. Did not find any of the issues regarding control buttons. Love the settings, cool setting a big + and a cold button for a burst of chilly air. 2 speeds, 3 setting plus cold button, fantastic air flow, does what it says for a fraction of the price of high end salon brands. Would gladly buy again!
When wife is happy with purchase, husband is happy with purchase
Works so good I bought another one when my wife decided to take the first one with her to her exercise class each morning.
I simply cannot say enough wonderful things about this product.  My reasons for a 5-star rating:Positives:* Powerful and efficient - hair dries quickly without being blown wild* Able to easily style while drying* Comes with two attachments AND they stay in place wonderfully* Retractable cord eliminates hassles between uses* For a hair drying styler, this is not excessively loudNegatives:* No complaints!This has been my top choice in hair dryers after using my sister's awhile ago!  I finally confirmed the type to purchase.  Then, I found it on Amazon's Today's Deals (daily deals) - even better!  This is a fabulous hair drying styler at an extremely reasonable price (as listed or with a deal)!  Over my lifetime, I have used many hair dryers, with a wide price range, and had not ever been super pleased with any one in particular....before using this one.  I was so looking forward to getting it and was super excited to use it....I was not disappointed at all!
Replaced a earlier version. Works well. Wife happy
Hair dryer is perfect and haven't had any problems since purchase!
My wife really LOVES this dryer. It was easy to put together and works Great. It dries her long hair just the way she likes it. She's Happy.. I'm Happy.
Love the night light and works great!!
I rate the product 4 stars. It dries quickly and cuts down the frizz a bit, but nothing out of this world. However, I just interacted with customer service for a problem, and I was very impressed with how the company handled the situation. The product definitely deserves an extra star for customer service!
Very good for travel and very potent.
Great dryer love it
Terrible power!!!
Item delivered on time, was as described
Best blow dryer I have ever purchased.
Great value
This hair dryer is amazing!only flaw: there's no swivel cord, making it resist moving around.Otherwise, its great! the PERFECT size for my weekend bag and there are plenty of settings.
I love this dryer!  It is so much more powerful than the one that it replaced.  It doesn't cause my hair to frizz and I have been able to drastically cut down on the amount of flat-ironing I do.  It is somewhat heavy, but this is to be expected with the extra power that it provides and I really don't have a problem with the weight.  I love the heavy-duty, long cord it has too!  My only complaint is one that I have heard from other viewers - the control buttons are somewhat awkward.  I have had to get used to holding this dryer in a different way than I've always held all other hairdryers.  If I hold it in the usual way, it is extremely easy to accidentally push the buttons with your hand and inadvertently change the settings.  Other than this small issue, which I am already getting used to dealing with, I think this is probably the best dryer that I have ever used.
This is an okay product. If you avidly blow-dry your hair get a bigger one. But for the occasional use it's okay
this is perfect, works great and so easy travel with due to is compact size.
Before I ever used this product I thought all hair dryers are the same because they simply just blow air. After used my friend's Panasonic Nano hair dryer, I knew I was wrong. This is so much better than the cheap dryer I bought at supermarket. My hair wasn't at all frizzy with this new hair dryer. I'm in love with this product
I love this dryer and wish they made it in a smaller travel size. Only drawback is that the attachment bends easily so if you pack it make sure to take it off first. It heats up better than any other dryer I've used and my salon uses these exclusively.
The only reason I cannot give it 5 stars is because it will not stick to my vanity which is made out of wood. It won’t hold in place after I place the blow dryer. Does stick very well to my vanity in the bathroom (glass/marble).
Great hair dryer.  Doesn't cause too much frizz.  Love the retractable cord.
Great for drying hair!
I'm not completely impressed with the cheap plastic although, Ive used it about 6 times and it's still in good condition ( also keep in mind that I am hispanic and have very long, thick and curly hair ). I purchased this because my daughter has one and after using it, I fell in love. But, hers is definitely made with better quality materials, you can tell by just holding both of them in your hands the difference in quality.  I thought I was getting a super steal based on the price I paid for it ($25) opposed to what my daughter paid ( she purchased hers directly from Andis for $52) As I previously mentioned, mines is still in good condition after using it several times, I'm just waiting to see how many more uses I get out of it. This is a case of you get what you pay for.
Very fprceful and dries my hair in 5 minutes-just like the professionals do it.
The lower setting does not work
I bought this Two days ago as my old dryer (conair 1875 watt) hasn't been drying as well lately.  I was impressed immediately with this dryer.  It is beautiful.  It is slightly heavier than my last one,  but it cut drying time considerably so I don't think this will be an issue.  It has three speeds.  It has three temperature settings. The highest is hotter than any blow dryer i have ever used.  I just dried my hair with it and my naturally wavy hair is so straight that I don't need to break out my flat iron. Yes, I am amazed by this thing! The medium heat setting is equivalent to my last dryers hottest setting.  I have twin daughters that are young and I think the only setting cool enough to dry their hair with is the lowest heat Setting. This dryer is so powerful,  yet a ton quieter than my previous dryer. My husband even commented on how quiet it is. My husband also liked the fact that it is heavier.  Being a mechanic he said it probably has a stronger,  more durable motor. I was reading the booklet that was included, and this dryer has a four year warranty.  That's pretty astounding considering the price point.  I love this dryer,  and I'd buy it again in a heart beat.  I'm thinking about buying another one to store,  because I seriously love it that much!  Go buy it!
The description for this product is incorrect.  It does not contain a cool shot button.
Used once on vacation so I can not comment on the longevity of this product. Size is slightly bigger than I had hoped, but I bought it because it was the best looking diffuser to come w. a travel dryer that I could find.  Price was right and I think it was a good investment for a travel dryer only- I would not use this for regular at home use.
The wife is very happy with this.  It was a replacement of a similar Conair that lasted many years.  This one has held up for a few months now and looks like it will hold up like the old one.  I am pretty sure she will buy a similar Conair if/when this one breaks.
Love it!
burned up first time used
This is an excellent product, I love it!
Works very well.  I have the same blow dryer in the past and that lasted a long time it's a really great blow dryer
I have straight thick hair and my old hair dryers would leave it frizzy until I slept on it. However when I tried it with this blowdryer, even at the fast dry attachment, it was smooth and sleek.Now that I have a digital perm, I can use the diffuser. I put half of my hair twisted, sectioned into thirds and put it on the diffuser! It works wonderful so far. I'm so happy with this blow dryer. Worth the price. First expensive blow dryer I have owned. Now I can have nice waves.
Makes my hair drying time much shorter.
EDIT:Turned my hair into straworiginal review:Pros: good blow, not too hotCons:heavy and the way the attachments attach is bad (you really have to push super hard)Best under $100 hairdryer I have ever used. I had a 20% of coupon at that big bed and bath store. It was 99.99 so I got a good deal. It is a solid hair dryer and solid made. Made in Italy. Good blow and not too hot means hair dries faster with less damage. With good technique can leave hair silky soft. Not as defrizzing as my Volare though. And it feels heavier to me. So my Volare will remain my baby. It is better than the Elchim 2001, the $300 T3,  $200 CHI and an FHI dryer that I tried. I have super long wavy hair, live in the Bay Area, and I don't get haircuts often enough, so I need the anti-frizz. Also I am not great at blowdrying hair so I need the idiot proof anti-frizzer.It is not as good as my Volare V2 by Babyliss with the Ferrari AC motor (paid $70 more for). That dryer is magic. That and the Italiabrava by Babyliss are the best hairdryers on the market!
I have a Conair hair dryer that I use at home.  I bought this one for a trip to the UK because of the dual voltage feature and compact size.  My trip is in three weeks so I am yet to try it out overseas yet but it arrived quickly and does seem very lightweight and easy to pack.
Favorite model. No longer available in stores. Bought as backup for 3 year old one currently using.
Works great - multiple speed and temps.
In a good, no, a great way! It is a *little* heavier than some models, but I'm only using it for a max of 15 minutes a day so that doesn't bother me. And I only mention it here because many of the reviewers I read listed that as a con. As for how quiet it is, I would say it's as quiet as the other quiet dryers I've owned made by other companies. It's not a whisper, but it's not a scream. My hair looks better than it has in a long time... It's certainly shinier and looks thicker when I use this dryer. The dryer is also a very sexy looking piece, so if you're going buy based on looks, go for this machine! The only negative I have is the cold shot button. I foresee this button breaking easily and in the near future. I try to avoid using the shot button in favor of the cold setting switch to prolong the inevitable, though.  I truly do love this dryer. I was not compensated for my review. I bought the dryer after researching. I'm very happy with my purchase!
Powerful, and quiet. It doesn't have that high pitched whine. It doesn't get super hot and doesn't have to because it's powerful enough. Other dryers would make my hair hot to the touch or burn my hand. My hair seems to be healthier and smoother after using this for a couple months too!
The best
I love the product
Bought this as a gift for my mother and she loves it!
The best travel dryer I have found. So much power in this little thing.
Thought it would be more compact, for traveling. Just a little big but okay
Dried my hair with no problem, but the cords are on the short side.
Very good easy installation.would recommend to anyone to try it,saw this in hotel and loved it
Great power and gets the job done fast.
Love this item. The heat is perfect for my hair and did i mention tht delivery was great. Came right on time!!!
My wife and kids love it; and for that, I'm a happy customer.
Perfect
Seems to work. Don't use it much.
Very heavy, didn't get hot enough to dry my hair.  Returned it.
Great dryer! Dries fast... The hottest setting is really hot so be careful not to burn yourself!
This little hair dryer is great! I had one just like it in the past. It lasted 20 years. It fits perfectly in my suit case, has just the right amount of power and heat. It is much better than others I have used (they did not last long). It is well constructed too. A good purchase. I had looked every where for a replacement and had to settle for inferior products. I am really happy Amazon had it. I highly recommend.
I have had better conair products in the past.
Love love this hair dryer. My first time to own a Turbo Power but should have been buying for years. Live and learn!I have very fine, thin, hair and all my other dryers have been to harsh on my fragile locks with 1875 watts. After researching the best for my hair issues - the lower wattage, 1500,  is perfect and dries my hair beautifully, smooth and shinny. This dryer is also very substantial in motor which is important to me so it will last.
Very lightweight so I don't end up with cramped arms after using these. The buttons are also placed away from my fingers so I don't accidentally turn them off.
Bargain price for a great hairdryer - several heat and speed settings, dries your hair quickly! Haven't used the diffuser yet but it is looks good.
Only had my dryer for a month but so far it's the best one I've ever had.  Ionic  feature makes hair smooth.  Seems to be built sturdy.  Folding handle retractable cord work well.  It it holds up it's a super buy at the price .
Not as heavy as I expected.  Works well and the power is good.
awesome product. Tucked out of the way in the female's bathroom of my home. I also purchased one for the male's bathroom in the house and will put in the master bathroom once I am complete with the remodel so if I ever get married again she will have one to use. great night light also. never have to turn on the bathroom light in the middle of the night..
It is the best hair dryer I have! I used have a old one which I used for many years! Best quality!
Fairly quiet as hair dryers go. Like the attachments. LOVE the brown and pink color.
Excellent product.  This is one of the best hair dryer i have ever own.  Highly recommended :-)
Decided to buy this hairdryer based on all the positive reviews.  I am very pleased with my purchase. The reviews are accurate and the price is great too.
Overall I am very happy with this product.  My old blowdryer was awkward to work with and weak, and I would only blow dry my hair for special occasions.  Now I blow dry my hair every time it's washed.  My blow-dry time has been cut in half with this blow dryer.  It's much more powerful than similarly priced blow dryers.  It has a long, sturdy power cord, which makes the dryer easier to maneuver around to dry and style your hair.  It comes with a nozzle but not a diffuser, so if you use a diffuser you'll need to purchase one separately.
Fantastic hair dryer! Was searching for a new hair dryer as my hot tools dryer was giving off a burning smell and really drying out my hair. I decided on xtava because of the good reviews and so glad I purchased it.  The nozzle for the dryer stays firmly in place which is fantastic since when I tried to use one on my previous dryers, it would always fall off.  My hair comes out super smooth.  It is very powerful and not super noisy. Another great feature is the removable back to clean out lint! I was also really impressed with the welcome letter from the company I received via email after I received the dryers with tips on blow drying my hair. Would definitely recommend this dryer to anyone I know.
Love it!
I don't know much about ionic dryers because I previously had the same hair dryer for over 15 years. I like this one so far. It is sturdy, but I don't consider it heavy. It has enough heat settings in my opinion and also includes a cool setting, similar to a hooded dryer, which I like, my last dryer did not have this.
this is my 2nd purchase of this product I wore the first one out after 11 years ! it still worked but the black cover blocking the heat would no longer stay on. I love this hair dryer it leaves my hair so soft no frizz ! Well worth the money ..one of those cases you get what you pay for!
Bonnet is so rediculously small it could not be placed on head of adult, let alone dry hair on rollers.I can't imagine what the professional is, certainly not a hair salon with this quality!  Disappointing.  Time consuming. Received when I got home 5/7. Diirected by Amazon to be returned by 5/7!  Silly waste.
Very pleased with the dryer.  It's a little heavier than my last one, but does a great job. I would recommend.
I would highly recommend this blow dryer. Even my mother-in-law said it is awesome. It is powerful and dries my hair fast. I plan to look at other products made by them as well.
Sweet, works as expected!
I love it, it fits my little peanut head just fine and really snug. I used it to deep condition my hair with a plastic cap and silk bonnet on top then the hair dryer bonnet. I used the silk bonnet to protect my ears and neck from getting to hot. This is the first time I have ordered this and I'm very happy.
Highly satisfied with the hair dryer and the company. My hair is long and thick. It is every texture in the book. Some curly hair, some straight, some frizzy, some fine, a lot gray, all highlighted/colored. It normally takes me 20 - 30 minutes to get it completely dry. Then I need to use the flat iron to calm it all down. With this hair dryer I had it completely dry in 10 minutes. When I use it with the Goody Quikstyle brush my hair is smooth enough that I only have to touch up a couple places with the flat iron. I live in the Deep South. Heat and humidity are a way of life. I can't tell you how happy I am with a hair dryer that cuts 10 - 20 minutes off the time I have to spend blowing more hot air my way.Also, I have received two very service minded emails from the company. It is because of these that I was prompted to write a review.  A quality product and a customer service driven company deserve a shout out.
we liked this so much we bought them for the rest of the bathrooms! convenient and easy to install. it even has a tiny night light built into it.
Great ceramic blow dryer, arrived promptly, entirely satisfied!
Love this dryer, ordered with Amazon Prime under 12 , 2 day arrival and use just for my Wonder Wash and Vapper dry system, wash in Wonder Wash, wring, hang on dryers until near dry and hang inside Vapper last few minutes for warm towels, shirts, light robes, socks etc good laundry system under 90, no more laundry mats!.
The wall mount dryer was just what I needed for my new small bathroom as I do not have any counter space.  Works great!
Update:  :(  3rd time using it on travel.  Love this little dryer.... fits great in my hand, easy control.... 3/4 finished with a blow dry,  hair soft waves and then......... oh no!!!!  it died.  Not circuit tripped. I pushed the reset, I plugged into other outlets....  I was in denial.  i just shook it and then, headed out to Walmart with my 3/4 blown out hair, with the one section not done in a french braid.  :)  LOL....  alas, back to a big dryer.  I really liked this but only got to use it 3 times._____Purchased for travel because of it's small size. Also purchased to use with Soft Hood Dryer attachment.  Wow this little dryer is quite powerful.  the switch was a little stiff to turn on at first and if feels a little cheap but Torumaliine ceramic, little power house.  love it.
broke my arm and went on vacation so this little gadget hellped a lot. It will not hold a heavy dryer, but worked fine with a travel dryer.Suction will not work on a porous surface but did fine on a mirror or glass shower door.
Best hairdryer I have ever used.  Large impellers really put out some air which speeds drying.  Can be very powerful or not depending on the setting you choose.
excellent I love it
Perfect hairdryer.
Wonderful! Just what I was looking for. I have medium length, thick, wavy hair. It smooths as it dries. Is light weight and quiet. And I love how hot it gets- lets me know its really working!
excellent
My hair normally takes forever to dry, but not with this dryer. It  drys so quickly and will NOT dry out your hair. Worth every penny
I like it but the only problem is everytime I dry my hair, the front cover always falling out :(
It works ok but it's not the easiest drier to use. It has an odor to it and I wish it was just a little smaller in size
Very good
This is a very nice dryer.
Suits my needs very well. Quiet and compact.
The dryer seems to be of good quality and would be easy to use if the nozzle were shorter.  I like the hairdryer itself very much but the nozzle is so long that I can't style the back of my hair easily.  I have shorter arms but I have never had this problem with other hair dryers.  Do you have a shorter nozzle to fit this dryer?  I bought this dryer because my old one was wearing out and a piece of the nozzle came off - making it difficult to use.
I tend to have frizzy hair.  I honestly haven't noticed a difference between this hair dryer or any old regular hair dryer making my hair less frizzy.  I ordered this one because my old one broke.  I'm not noticing any difference.
This dryer works well for a time, but breaks easily. I've replaced it 3 times! THREE! I bought it because it was the cheapest option, but after purchasing it 3 times, I should've just gone with a higher end model.
Stopped working after 3 months.
Not recommended.  It doesn't get hot and the comb was flimsy. Very disappointed
Perfect size for traveling abroad and the price was right! I wish it was a tad more powerful but I can live with it as is.
This is a very good dryer,I give it 5 stars.Thanks
Very small and very light.  Perfect for travel and my silicon diffuser fits right over the nozzles.  I recommend this product.
fit right where we needed it in our motorhome
Heavy Duty awesome dryer. The cord alone lends itself to the words heavy duty. Powerful, light weight, multi-heating options. The best dryer I've ever purchased in my 50+ years, that is when hand held dryers began. I have long hair and it's cut my time in half. I can't say more other than I hope it last me a long time.
Thought it would be more powerful, is it really 2000 watts?
Extremely fast delivery and the product works great. Very happy!
it's great i enjoy working it. thanks much 
as expected! good
I would give it zero stars if I could but unfortunately that is not an option. I bought this product because it was dual voltage, and it not only burnt in the first time I used it, it also caught fire. I strongly do not recommend anyone to buy this product.
I bought this on the recommendation of my stylist and I hate it.  The hot setting is too hot and burns my scalp, the power is too strong and makes my hair completely flat and yet, doesn't seem to dry it unless it's on these higher settings.  Also, it is a very heavy hair dryer.  I am very disappointed in this product.  Wish I had kept the box to return.  This is not worth the splurge.
Dries my hair incredibly quickly. What used to take 20 minutes now takes 5, it makes getting ready in the morning much more pleasant.
I like how it has a low, medium, and high setting.  (Havent bought a new dryer in a while:)  i just wish the concentrator was a bit thinner since that would cause less frizz.
I have long thick hair and I go through blow dryers like crazy. This blow dryer dries my hair quickly. It's not too heavy and is easy to hold. Love it!
I recently became aware of Xtava products while looking for a new hairdryer. I wanted the ceramic ionic technology as I have baby fine hair which tends to break and attract static way too easily. This hair dryer has been amazing. It's super quiet and has multiple heat levels which is great. I can usually dry my hair in about 4 to 5 minutes. I use the dryer with a flat brush, and have noticed my hair is smooth, shiny, and frizz free.I also have to say that Xtava has excellent customer service. When I originally purchased the dryer, Amazon fulfilled the order and shipped the wrong one. Xtava was super helpful in getting the issue resolved with Amazon. I now own two Xtava dryers and love them both. I'm really happy with my purchases, and the quality of the Xtava products. I highly recommend this dryer.
I have had three of these over the years. Ionizing dryer keeps the frizz out of your hair. Cool setting is nice in addition to the two settings for hot, blasting and normal. Great hair dryer!
The hair dryer has performed very, very well. I hadn't realized how much time the old dryer was taking to dry and style my hair.Claire Greenberg
Great power blow dryer for wonderful price.
Simply doesn't work!
Love it dry so fast , not very good with freez but for the price is good.
The Heat guard attachment constantly pops off & there's nothing you can do about it. Don't waste your money
It's really bad!! It stopped working from the 1st use 
Great
Love the small size and the way that it dries my hair.  Great little hair dryer.
This is the 4th time I've bought this dryer over the course of a several years. It does fail at some point, but at the constant daily use it gets. Still very worth the price, it's quite powerful and puts out more heat and airflow than others I've used. Very happy with it overall!
over priced junk
Excellent noise levels--very low. Heat control very good as well. Great hairdryer so far, particularly vs. previous Conair models.
The retractable cord is wonderful for storage.  Power is great.
I purchased this hair dryer a couple of months ago after my old Conair died.  I like to use my dryers on low speed, but high heat.  Although the two settings should be independent, this dryer is just lukewarm on low speed.  It also made my hair fuzzy, and while it was lightweight - it felt cheap.I quit using it two months after I started using it and invested in a better dryer.  I purchased the Elchim 2001 through Amazon, and while it's a bit more expensive ($80), it's worth every penny.  I would not recommend the Conair 1875, unless you want your hair to look like a fuzzy mess.
Great performance but they need work on the product painting, the paint started pilling after a few day's using the dryer but in general it's a great product for the price
great product for price
The dryer work fine for about 10 months but it did end up catching fire while I was using it. I think for the price it should last longer than 10  months.
This is a great little dryer. I bought it after using one in a hotel and wanting one for myself. It is very basic but does the job without destroying my eardrums. A minor complaint is that the cord is bit on the short side, but I cope with it.
Great little dryer
The motor died after a year of very light use. (2-3x/month). It was a very poor value for the $80 I paid in Sept 2013.I wasn't very impressed even while it was functioning. Blowout styling results were not as good as I get with my drugstore cheapie; hairs would get chomped and tangled in the dryer; poor button placement so the controls were frequently switched on/off, high/low by the palm of my hand while I was trying to dry my hair. (Maybe I gripped it funny, but it did annoy me every time I used it)
makes my hair smooth
Wow,this dryer came in and I was so happy with the design and color of it.It also came in the nick of time as my much cheaper hair dryer had just went out.Believe me when I say this hair dryer is top of the line! Straight out of the box I noticed that it was light weight and had a sleek design.Upon use of this product I seen that it had several different settings as to get the desired drying time you'd like.It includes a diffuser to keep your hair from getting too overheated and dried out plus it has a reset and test button on the plug in.When I used this hair dryer I noticed that at the highest heat that the air is not super strong like some other hair dryers out there,but it definitely dries your hair in record time! This hair dryer is easy to hold on to whilst drying your hair and has a good vent on the back as to not clog up easily.I recommend this hair dryer to anyone looking for a new replacement because it work really well and is high quality for your money.I got this product for purpose of review,all claims and views are 100 percent my own.
Was advertised as red and came as salmon pink. Lasted roughly 2 years before the heating element went out. Also, fairly weak fan.
Used to a little more power but from a small (hotel-like) dryer, it works well.
I am so excited by this dryer. It much quieter than my old one and dries my hair super fast without feeling dried out.
Horrible, lasted 6 weeks than started sparking flames!Would NOT recommend
Not disappointed. Works well and super small, perfect for travel.
OK hair dryer.  I like the non-skid rubber thingies on the sides of the dryer so it doesn't slip off bathroom shelf.  The overall drying could be improved.  My Vidal Sassoon travel dryer of the same wattage dried my hair much faster.  I'm going to buy another one of those again and just keep this one as a backup dryer in our guest bath.
Powerful as any other hairdryer out there. Compact and ligthweight enough for my overseas travel.  And so convenient to not have to carry a converter.  I absolutely recommend at this price.
Had one of these in dark blue for years, it finally gave out. This one is alright, but feels lighted and cheaper made then my old one. Love the retractable cord.
Dryer is extremely heavy!  Not as hot or strong as other comparably priced dryers.  Buttons are easy to accidentally press while drying.  Returned it after trying it once.
BEST BLOWDRYER for NATURAL GIRLS. I Never use anything else
A little heavy for a travel dryer
very fast drying experience!
I absolutely love that it offers the two heat settings and separate speeds. My old dryer only had one control and if you wanted high speed it meant you had to have hair frying temperatures along with it. With the Wind Flower dryer I'm able to have a cooler temperature and impressively fast blowing capabilities.I have thick hard to dry hair and I can honestly say that I dried my hair faster than I ever have with other dryers.It's light weight so my arm didn't get tired using it which is also great.I received this with a promotional discount however my reviews are honest and unbiased.
Pleased with packaging and shipping. Pleased with product. Its better than our other brands and love how fast it dries my hair and leaves it less frizzy.
This hair dryer performs as expected.  I have dry/damaged hair due to chemo 2 years ago.  I have never owned a hair dryer and thought that maybe blow drying my hair with a diffuser to increase wave/curl would make it look better but it didn't.  However this is not due to the hair dryer.  The hair dryer is light, was very easy to operate and try different hair styles with especially since it includes both a diffuser and a concentrator. I tried at least 10 different hair styles with this thing and found it super easy to adjust and operate.  Feature I love the most: adjustable heat setting.  I use the warm instead of hot and I can put the fan on low or high depending on how fast I want it.  Great dryer for the price but also for all of the features.
I've used this dryer for over a year now and I think it works really well. I don't find any difference between this dryer and normal dryer but it blow dries  my hair really quickly and has options for cold and hot air.
Noisy. I don't see anything professional about this dryer.
This is one powerful hair dryer. The heat can be controlled along with the height and hood position.
Great
THIS ISTHE BEST  DRYER I HAVE EVER USED
I was skeptical to think that an expensive hair dryer could be better than my basic, cheapie Conair I had been using, but it totally works!  It's alot heavier than I thought it would be but you don't have to hold it as long because my hair actually dried faster.  I got lured in by the coupon but it was still alot to spend.  My hair was healthier, indeed shinier and less frizzy after blow-drying.  I wasn't exactly sure how to use all the nozzle attachments and when to use which for what, but I'm still experimenting.
Love this dryer the best that I have found so far.
Pro:  lightweight, good power, less frizziesCon:  have to unplug nightlight in bathroom to accommodate the large GFC plug of dryer
Works great!! Dries my hair quickly and stores beautifully with the retractable cord and folding handle !! So glad I got it ; )
It is heavier than expected and doesn't feel balanced in my hand.  The opening and attachments are smaller than our previous Remington, which is what I was trying to replace.  It is okay, but I don't think I would buy the same model again.
Good
I was iffy after I ordered this product with all the horrible things that were said about it, but I really like this hair dryer.  I only use the cold settings to dry my hair in general.  I am already using it for a few months and I love it.  Don't depend on what people have to say unless you try it.  Unless of course it is all bad.
This is a great hair dryer at a great price.  My wife already had this one and has been using it for several years.. So when my other brand hair dryer died, I bought this one and so far so good.  I have been using it for about 3 months now.
Works great
The picture of the product is deceptive. I bought it on Amazon and what I received was a very cheap looking product. The instructions on how to hang it on the wall is also very confusing. I am concerned about the safety of this product so I have stopped using it. Now I am left with a cheap dryer that I am never going to use. I wish I can return it back without paying a ton on shipping.
Very powerful for a small hair dryer.  Bought this solely to use when I travel, because not all places provide a hair dryer.  But the places that do provide a hair dryer, the quality is poor.  So...bought one for myself and love it!  Especially the pink color and small little zebra print carrying case.
This is a great hair dryer - it seems to be designed well. It's definitely pretty - doesn't take up too much space. It has all the features that I need, like multiple heat settings, multiple air flow settings and even a cool blast to set the style. It fits standard hair dryer attachments too -  like a diffuser. It also comes with the attachment that focuses the air blast - I think it's called the nozzle, but it's key to minimizing damage on your hair.My last hair dryer (from a different brand) was closer to $65 and although it worked great, it started to breakdown within a couple of months. It finally cracked it half in my checked bag during a recent flight. The price was right for this dryer - and I love the customer-centric focus of the company, xtava.I also love the follow up communication I received after buying this - tips for how to use it well, contact info if I have any problems. So, I'm happy with the dryer, but communication from xtava has been really great - the next time I'm in the market to buy something like this, I'll check xtava first.
I love my Andis Ceramic blow dryer. Not only does it get our hair dry quickly but it also straightens at the Sam's time. Can't get no better for me and my family. Quick and easy!
The best hair dryer I ever used!!
Very light weight, easy to use with one hand as you round brush with the other... and overall was above my expectations!
Love this hairdryer! So fast and light. Cut styling time in half
This is the best blow dryer I ever purchased. I have very thick long hair. With this dryer it dried in no time
wonderful hair dryer and at a good price
Great hair dryer
Works great.
I bought this. Broke. Decided to give a second chance because I loved how compact it is and it is off counter. I have had a new one for 4 mos now and my 2nd one broke. Says I cannot return so now I am out 2 dryers and spent over $70 - will never buy another one. Terrible product
For the price, this hair buyer is wonderful. My hair is seriously prone to being frizzy, and with (1) being tourmaline ceramic, (2) having a warm setting as well as a cool and hot, and (3) having a concentrator, my hair has started acting much better. It's also fairly quiet. The lack of five stars is because it isn't particularly easy to store; it barely fits in the normal-size drawer, and including the diffuser, concentrator, and a hairbrush, it can be challenging to fit it in the drawer. Definitely a wonderful buy, though.
TY
excellent
I used amazon prime and got this pretty fast. I haven't used it as yet but I did test the item and it works seemingly well... The barrel of the blowdryer works pretty well and the force of the air blown was great. However while inspecting this item it has scuff marks on the concentrator as if it had been used before or before being shipped. Not sure if it will lessen in terms of the force of the air over a period of time but we'll see. Also at the back of the dryer there was a removable backing that allows for cleaning if the air vent gets clog, which I didn't expect and it was a pleasant supprise. The concentrator also takes quite a bit of strength to put on. (Twisting it on doesn't make much sense so I'd recommend lining it up and the pushing it down on the barrel)...My intial review however is 4stars. I will be doing an update within the next month..
I'm profesional hairstylist and i love it.
I bought this hair dryer several years ago and really loved it, so when it stopped working recently due to a loose connection in the GFCI plug I knew I had to purchase it again.  The retractable cord is just brilliant -- every hair dryer should have this feature.  The cool shot button is handy to help set your style.  And the diffuser attachment is just *fabulous*, with air being directed in and through the prongs as well as around them to provide more even heat and air distribution.  I am so glad Conair is still making this model and that Amazon carries it.
Powerful!
It certainly works okay, but !It's very big, it's quite heavy and you'll need to have a good memory to remember all of the functions.I would say this one has been Over Engineered in the extreme and I'm sure as I will, many will go back to their lighter and simpler to use unit.A speed, cool and perhaps two or three heat settings are I'm sure is what most of us need and want and I feel this baby has just got too many functions to be practical.Luckily, I purchased this on a very special Amazon Deal, but truthfully I will just keep this one as a spare.
Handy little blowdryer, better than leaving one plugged in on vanity! Not alot of power though
Has lots of power to dry hair quickly and it is great for travel.
Best hairdryer ever!
good product
excelent fast.  love it
This i gave as gift & it blew up within one month!!!!
It is good and I am satisfied
I like everything about it except for the night light.  It is too bright for me.
I love the convenience of not sitting in one spot. But the front part of my hair never dries but the back and sides dries in no time at all.
Purchased this over two months ago and it is the best hairdryer I've ever used!! I get disappointed whenever I use any other hair dryer because it's simply not the same! Very strong power, dries hair fast and easily. Perfect temperature for me as well. Very happy with my purchase! Thank you!
Nice bang for the buck!  Only negative: the back end sieve fills up w/dust and hard to clean...
It's perfect!  Adjustable hood height and plenty of room for a head full of rollers!
Wife love the style and performance.
Works great for the price. Leaves hair shiny.
Phenomenal product
Great for travel.  And does a nice job styling hair.
Excellent and very durable hairdryer. This is a heavy quality dryer; no cheap light-weight plastic here. Comes with 2 attachments. Would be nice if it came with a retractable cord, but money well spent nonetheless.
It works as it should be working
I want to  return this because it does not have a plug.
It is a little heavier than most hair dryers I have had. I like the fact that high heat does not burn and it has very powerful air flow.  Wish it wasa little lighter weight.
It isn't the stronger dryer I have used, but it is very adequate and it is easy to handle. The shipping was quick and perfect. So If your dryer dies This was a great substitute!! Thank you.
Great! Its light, efficient and has a super cute design. Its even easier to use than my mom's expensive hair dryer.
Yes it works great
Spectacular, light-weight, compact and an outstanding price!  I purchased two!!
ANOTHER BLOW DRYER THAT CAUSES FLYAWAY HAIR AND THE FRIZZIES!  I WISH SOMEONE KNEW OF A MINI DRYER THAT ACTUALLY STRAIGHTENS BANGS!  UNFORTUNATELY, THIS DRYER DOES NOT DO THE TRICK, I AM SORRY TO SAY!
Burned out about 4 months after I bought it. Total bummer. I have used Conait hair dryers for years and never had an issue before. This one was a bust :-(
Low noise good hair dryer
A little noisy, but powerful, small enough to pack. Cord is a bit on the short side, but it's perfect for my use.
I like that this dryer provides greater heat than my 1800 dryer, however it doesn't put out as much power.
Lasted only a few months before it died. Simply stopped working both the motor and the heating. During the time that it worked, average product. Not the best but not the worst.
I had a Remington dryer before this that lasted 5 years. I have thick, super long hair, so I needed something powerful that wouldn't leave my arms sore from an hour's worth of styling. My old hair dryer did the job in less than 15 minutes - it was miraculous.The new line stinks, period. Instead of staying consistently hot, it cycles through heat settings (including cold). The cord is also much shorter than before - a pain for tall women. The newest development with my dryer is sparks SHOOTING OUT from the dryer INTO my hair. Um, hello?! I've had this for 8 months, and I use it anywhere from 1-3 times a week for 20 minutes or less.Two stars because it is still fairly powerful, and drying time isn't insanely long. I want to love this dryer... I just wish the old version was still available.
It is great I can dry my hair while I put on my makeup.
I couldn't find a blow dryer this would stay on without popping off. I went through about 5 different ones.
Just received, neither of the accessories would fit on the dryer. I would not recommend this to anyone.
Works fine.
LoBe it
works great
Pleased with my new Conair hair dryer and the option for choices on level of drying. I am a little disappointed that occasionally the cord hangs up as it is retracting and is very difficult to start again.
This works for me. I like a small hairdryer. It is plenty powerful and plenty pink!
Great product !
Worked perfect!
Powerful and small. Like the compact convenience of it and am happy this dryer doesn't take over my drawer space.
exactly what I needed. love it.
This is the best of hair dryer. Light weight, efficient, dual voltage and work fine
I don't believe the hair dryer is worth the price. All I can say is that it did not out perform my 5-year old, $30 CONAIR that I purchased from Target.
Good!
Not as powerful as advertised.  Air force is weak.  For price you get what you get.
i love my hair dryer. my hair does dry in less time.
Works as well as more expensive products of similar type.
I've owned and used this dryer daily for the last 12 years. Works well on my wavy average thick hair. Its sturdy and dang near indestructible because its been dropped plenty of times. I've never considered getting a different one until recently, I think the motor is about to give up the ghost because it shoots out sparks (not to worry, I have not started on fire or lost any hair) but I am noticing more frizz than I have in the past. Only complaint is that the filter can not be completely removed to clean it out (has a cover but it doesn't really do much, lots of lint still gets in there). We have to use a q-tip and canned air spray to try and remove the lint. I am going to upgrade and see what that gets me. Buying:  Will let you know how it compares in a week or so.
As an international traveler, I love the Dual Voltage!!
The heat did not last for long, just cold air blows.  The dryer is stylish and the attachment does not fall off.  It is sad the heat stopped within a week.
Dryer does not put out the heat as compared to the dryer it is replacing.  Blows strong but not hot enough.  The $20 Conair at Costco puts out more heat than this product.
This gives one choice of heat and power. It is fast and nice
The locking mechanism on the hose is not stable enough to hold the hose securely. If I make a sudden move the hose pops off
When this arrived i didn't even open it for a couple weeks, but as soon as i went to use it, it only blows cold air!
Very light, fries my hair quickly. Like the cool button.
Love it. Works great doesnt over heat! Perfect buy!
A couple of things to think about before buying this dryer. First, the cord is pretty short. It's about 3 feet, and 1/3 of it does not retract (by design); so, about a foot of the cord hanging even when you are not using the dryer. Second, the there's no temperature setting, and the temperature is very low. If you have long hair, it takes a long time to dry it. For the price, this dryer is not bad, but for these reasons, I bought a different dryer. This dryer is now in the guess bathroom.
I liked the hair dryer it. It is like the ones at the hair salon.
My only complaint is that the extension does not clip on. Whenever I put the dryer away, the piece falls off and I have to go fishing for it. Other than that, it is light weight and cuts dry time. The highest heat setting is HOT.
Love this blow dryer.  Hair so much easier to manage with this dryer than my old that just got hot.
I loved it
Hi, would have given it a 5-star, as it worked really well and was powerful yet quiet.  Unfortunately, not even a year old and with no warning, one day the on/off switch no longer flicked on and off (like a spring had broken inside or something) and I had to throw it away.  Also, the filter is not easily accessible, like with some hair dryers that have a trap door that opens so you can reach them.  The only way to clean the filter is trying to shove a paper clip or pipe cleaner in between the vent slots and see if you can somehow pick the hair/dust out of the filter.
I had bought this blow dryer in a convenient store and loved it!  I went back and purchased an extra one for my guest bathroom for company to use.  Our family has a lot of birthdays in March and I thought this would be a great gift for my daughters.  The convenient store did not have any of these left, so I went to my Trusty Amazon and bought two from them. All of our daughters have waist length to knee length hair and I have very thick and long hair and it takes us 30 to 45 mins with other dryers to dry our hair.  This blow dryer does my hair in 15 mins.  I love this thing!!  We don't understand how some say they get their long hair stuck at the intake in the back of the blow dryer because most women do not have knee length hair and we have never had this issue.  If you want a powerful blow dryer, this is the one for you..
Nice hairdryer. Simple and solid. I use mine for drying off my goldendoodle when she's been out in the rain.
I really like it for a couple of reasons. The size and also the blower, it is the best I have ever used.One problem, I had one before this order and it only lasted a year.
Great seller and great product, this hair dryer is manageable and leaves my hair perfect. The drier is a bit heavy but other than that, perfect size and it makes wonders
great for the guest room
Works really well, and fun colors
For commercial setting they are neat and clean but with heavy everyday use they get about 1-1.5 years before burning out. Very happy with the product and would recommend them to other businesses. I will be purchasing more in the future!
The hairdryer was good while it lasted but has now burnt out. Dead in under two years. I bought it for $26.75 two years ago on Amazon Prime and now it seems tripple the price! How is that even possible?
Great product!
Excellent hair dryer. I love it because I can get very high heat on a low or high blow setting. Also it cools down quickly on the cool air setting to lock in styles. Just enough blow power and plenty of choices for temp and speed. Easy to handle.
Works well , used for a whole 2 hours to dry some stuff.
Received a replacement for this one that exploded about 4-6 months ago and that also blew up yesterday....if you use a hairdryer every day this is not the one for you. It would stop half way through drying (and it takes less then ten minutes to dry my hair) and I would have to let it cool off before it would restart. Glad I never mounted it.
Just what I was wanting!!!
Work really nice is awesome. .....
I bought this exact hairdryer more than 5 years ago and I had to buy it again. It's efficient and travels well!
I wish I had this dryer forever!
Love, love, love it!!! Very comfortable to use, controls in the right spot and dries my hair quickly and leaves it smooth and shiny!!! VERY happy!!! And it has sparkles... 
I have always had excellent luck with Conair hair dryers.  My previous one lasted over five years!  I have been using this one for a week so far and I love it.  It is lightweight and dries your hair quickly (without making you feel like you are going through a wind tunnel).  It is a little smaller than my old dryer, so it would also be useful for travel.  Very nice.
The dryer works great.  The only reason for not 5 stars is the cord retraction.  It sometimes takes three times to get the cord to retract fully.
EXCELLENT
This is a nice tiny size for traveling, but I returned it because it does not have a cool shot button.
Really nice product, but some times the cord retainer button not working properly
I bought this because my older Conair caught on fire one morning, after about 6 years of use. I needed something quick and inexpensive. That is what this is. The diffuser is not well conceived, the directional is poorly done. The airflow is slow, and the dryer doesn't seem to get hot enough. This worked well enough in a pinch, but is not my recommended choice for everyday use.
Very nice. I love the different heat settings and the noise level is really low compared to my old Conair hair dryer
It is tiny and lightweight but very powerful. It is perfect for travel.
Doesn't over dry my hair!  Love it!
The only reason why I bought this blow dryer was that my other hair dryer gave out on me and due highly to the reviews.  The positive reviews were right on with the product.  I would highly recommend this product to the 3 settings for your hair and the add-on.
Momma loved it :)
This hair dryer is light weight and works awesome! I love the multiple settings and the size for travel. So far no issues.
Great little Hair Dryer!! It quickly dries even a lot of Hair.
Works well!
I really like th hair dryer! It drys fast and makes my hair look great! Highly recommended!
very good working and I like me hear after the ions
Excellent, but noisier than I thought.
Best hairdryer I've ever had, love the ease of cord retraction.
Great product ! The only bad thing was that the wheels didn't fit .
Works fine, I just wish there was a cool setting for those hot days you have to blow dry your hair. It also seems like it doesn't get as hot as my other hair dryer this size.
This works great. We've had it a few years now and still going strong.
Has great power - just what I was looking for.
Bought this for $20 on Amazon (sale?).  Nice and quiet compared to the one my wife used to use.  I'm surprised more women don't have hearing loss from all the noise of these things.
Gets my hair dry. Folds up neatly. But it didn't do anything extra special to my hair. It's a hair dryer...and it dried my hair. It gets the job done n fits in my luggage. So it does what it's supposed to do.
Lots of power, works great, hair doesn't seem as dry after using.  Would definitely buy again.
The heat setting is only two it said it would have four not happy
Worked great with adapter.  Just follow instructions on proper settings.
Tons of power! I love this blow dryer! Worth the higher price!
Lightweight and efficient. This is a good buy on a solid dryer that should last for years.
granddaughter loves it
good
Very Good
Love our hair dryers. They are out of the way yet within reach.
This is by far the best hair dryer I have ever owned!  I have curly hair and have found that the diffuser that comes with it is the best for making my hair have the best curls.  I had actually purchased two other hair dryers (one specifically for curly hair) and they didn't work at all!  The diffuser on this dryer is the perfect size to get all of my thick hair.  Not only that, the hair dryer doesn't blow my hair all around when trying to get the right curls.  I also love the cool setting feature on the dryer.  You won't regret purchasing this hair dryer!
good
Sturdy, not heavy and easy to use.
Great.
Good product
The dryer works very well. The only issue I have is, the bonnet is a bit small and it's too tight. There is no way to loosen the string.
Use it in a Motor Home and works great.
Works great.  Compact.
I'm a professional and have used this dryer daily for years. Mine recently died so bought another one. Reasonable price too.
excellent: compact and very powerful.
dries your hair very quickly,I am very happy with this product
Seems to work okay. I haven't really had the chance to try it out yet. I pulled it out of the box and tested it, so for now its okay. The hair dryer and attachments are much smaller than I imagined. Its a normal size hair dryer, however I'm used to a much bigger one by Revlon. Hopefully this one matches up well to the standards of the Revlon products. I figured I couldn't beat the price....
Good
good buy for the money.  Works perfectly.
It's ok but I was expecting it to have more power. Very expensive and same power as the previos model. I kept it because I don't have time to shop around, otherwise, it would had gone back.
This hair dryer worked perfectly on my recent trip to Holland, Belgium, France, and England.  There was no converter needed, just an outlet adapter when switched on the 250 V mode and used only on the low setting.  To clarify, you can ONLY use it on the LOW setting, however on the low setting it runs like it is on high - very easy, and worked perfectly.  It is also extremely compact for easy packing, but still worked like a bigger, nice hair dryer.  Hope this helps someone :)
Met my expectations.
GIVEN AS A GIFT AT CHRISTMAS... AWESOME PRODUCT, MY SISTER LOVES IT AND SHE HAS EXTREMELY FRIZZY HAIR.
I realized a bit too late in my adult life that a good blow-dryer makes all the difference in the look and feel of your hair. I simply could not figure out why my hair was always kind of sticky and not quite fully dry when I got out of the shower and tried to dry my hair with my 5+ year old Conair that I bought at CVS very inexpensively.I did some research online and scoffed at the $150+ dryers that were being promoted. This one was on the list, and honestly, given the relatively lower price point versus the other professional dryers, I was willing to try it out.WOW. I have used it now about 3 times, and it is hard to believe what a significant difference I see in my hair. I styled it myself for a formal Gala event, and was able to achieve the shiny look, feel, and volume in my hair that any professional stylist could achieve. It was unreal. Even on a work day I feel so much better about myself having simply styled my hair with this blow dryer. It targets the hot hair wonderfully and leaves my hair so dry, shiny and healthy.I went back and ordered one to send to my mom! She is also a victim of ignorance-to-bad-dryer-itis, so I went ahead and sent her the cure.Happy Drying!
This hair dryer has a a short cord and you have to have it close too a plug. The other other issue is the on and off switch and the temperature level are too close to where you hold the dryer and the buttons switch on and off all the time.  It's hard to hold the dryer.
I absolutely love it!
Great contr
I'm using this for about a month and its perfect!!!! Fast dryer ever, doesn't harm your hair and the result is like a pro.
This product is very good.
Works great on my fine hair, lots of air, love the heat settings, and the pattern is fun.
Bonnet was very tight around the head. I took the elastic out and replaced it with some 1/4 inch elastic material purchased from Walmart, taping it to some automotive wire and threading through the bonnet. Now my wife likes it very much.
I purchased this hair dryer after it was recommended by a friend.  I absolutely love it!  I have long hair and have never been able to dry my hair as quickly as I can with this hair dryer.  I can't say enough good things about it and highly recommend it to anyone!
We bought two wall mount hairdryers to install at a vacation rental.  They work well and are attractive.  They are small, don't take up too much wall space and leaves the counter top clear.  It was a good choice for us.
As a bald man, I love this hair dryer. It helps my wife dry her hair in a fair amount of time, less than her previous hair dryer. Seems to work pretty good. Typically loud when on, so I leave the room. Also, of note, this hair dryer does not have an actual turbo despite the product description. I feel like this is either false advertising and I have been duped, or the seller has no idea what the hell a turbo actually is. Turbos are found on internal combustion engines, both gasoline and diesel. If 'turbo' is meant to mean something like strong wind, they should have used a word like Kyōfū, which is Japanese for strong wind. Or maybe the German word for hair dryer, which is föhn. Either way, don't be fooled. There is no actual turbo, quiet fan and motor is subjective. It is loud. And I have not tested the lifeline shock protection. I would hope it works, but after the other misleading information, your results may vary.
Im a hairstylist. I have 2 of these. Super light and dries great. Not loud either!
Compact and easy to use
My daughter says that it is easy to use and is fine.
Great purchase! Works perfectly.
little bit heavier than expected.
Love it....
I love my new Rusk! It is a little heavier than I thought it would be, but it is easy to hold. The 4 attachments make any style possible.
The hair dryer is quiet and powerful enough to dry my hair, however, the on/off switch stopped working the first day. I did not want to go through taking it off the wall and send it back so I am using this item by plugging and unplugging the hair dryer as needed for use. The switch should last years, but didn't even work for one day.
LOVE this hairdyer!!  Dries my hair in half the time, is so quiet and light in weight.  My girlfriend has owned this dryer for years and always has it with her when we travel together.  After our last vacation together I decided it was time I owned my own!
So far used only one time, but I liked how it handled and it did a good job.
I'm so glad that I finally got one of these for home. Works really well, not too loud and my hair doesn't feel fried like a hand-dryer. My only suggestion is getting a weight to add to the base because it can tip over easier than it should.
It made my hair very puffy...very, very, way too puffy
Yes the blow dryer works well to dry my  hair , but it didn't leave my hair smooth without frizz . It was also awkward to handle , the nozzle is long . I will go back to my old hair dryer !
Dry that hair for less than $13...
This is a wonderful hair dryer. I would recommend to anyone.
If you want it to de-frizz and smooth your hair and straighten it then it is a 5 star purchase.
well, it just didn't turn on after a year of use. it wasn't dropped or near to a water or anything that might've caused it to malfunction.As i was getting ready for my day, it just didn't turn on. i tried to troubleshoot it, reset, use a different plug etc. no luck.
Second one I have owned. They are great. Last forever and very sturdy.
Excellent, perfect amount of air speed without blowing your hair everywhere like the newer high speed dryers. My second purchase.
pricey but excellent dryer. I like quality items.
Best I've ever bought. I have long thick hair and it only takes about 5-7 minutes to dry with this blow dryer.
Love this little blow dryer, works like a regular size dryer!!!
ABSOLUTELY LOVE NEW HAIR DRYER!!!Exactly what I was wanting, my hair is thick and short and this hair dryer is amazing at getting my hair dried quick!!!
Bonnet too tight!
Best hairdryer ever!!!
Love it! It has a lot of power and works very well.
Awesome in perfect condition the box was a little beat up but the product is fantastic
This is a nice sized hairdryer and has been working for about six months with daily use. My only complaint is I have thick hair so I wish it had a little more power and ran a little more hot like some of my other hair dryers.
Very nice, compact, high quality dryer with good controls - a good value.
Works well, good power, able to dry hair quickly.
I love this hair dryer! I have long, natural hair. I used to blow dry and flat iron my hair until it started breaking and looking *dead*. I heard about this dryer on You Tube from Sista with Real Hair. I ordered and received it within 3-4 days. No more blow drying for me. Great Price too!
When I touched the box I knew right then and there that something doesn't feel right. It didn't feel like a brand new box and when I opened it up my suspicion was confirmed. I have received a used or return product when I paid for a new one. The hair dryer had marks on it from previous use. I'm not happy about this.  UPDATE: I decided to use it anyways but it wouldn't even work. I tried resetting and testing it but it won't even turn on. The buttons are very cheaply made. When I moved the buttons it felt like it would fall apart. Very disappointed.
I use it daily. It's good and value for money.
Do yourself a favor and buy this right now.
It's a really good value for the money.  It is a bit heavier than I am used to and if just got s bit hotter it would be perfect
This is the best compact hairdryer i ever purchased. So much power.
A good piece of kit. I chose it for my wife she loves it. So powerful that she rarely uses it on full power (2 wiggles)
I love this dryer.  I purchased about 3 weeks ago and have used it almost every other day since I bought it.  It dries extremely fast in the morning so it allows me to not have to blow dry which is essential with African American hair and relaxers to prevent dryness. The settings are great and It is super quiet which is what I was looking for.  Those are all definite positives.  However, I would have to agree with one of the other reviewers.  It is extremely top heavy and I had the same problem in that yesterday it fell over and the visor in the front broke.  Now I am hoping I can find someone that replaces the part as the part is screwed in and if that is the case then this would possibly increase my score a little but you still have the problem of it falling over in the future.  If I cannot find a part to replace it online then I would drop this review to a 2 or 1 since it doesn't work as well without the visor keeping the heat in.
Nice hair dryer but very heavy.
Ok.... It really dosent get that hot.
Great hair dryer. no complaints
This is great!!!
It's really pretty and useful! The delivery is fast! Thanks
The power of the dryer seems less than I would have thought.  Still nice.
Great hair dryer! Shipping was very fast!
Love this hair dryer.
This blow dryer seemed to be just what I wanted, but was a huge disappointment.  It is very loud as I think one reviewer stated.  That I could deal with but that was just one small detail.  The attachment for the hair curling I could not work, although that may just be me.  The settings for the hot and cold on this are right at the finger tips where you hold the dryer.  Therefore, if you are not careful you will be drying on warm instead of high.  You start wondering why its not getting dry.  I have had to change it back as many as 20 times in one hair drying session.  And now the last and & most frustrating feature of the dryer.  The concentrated hair drying attachment that was stated in the description of the product as coming off for easy cleaning, unlike most other models.  Well yes, it does come off for easy cleaning alright, it just blows it across the room as you are drying your hair.  You just don't want anyone else in the room with you for you never know where the line of fire may be.  It blows off with quite a force so I am sure it would hurt someone, particularly a small child.  I owned a Vidal Sassoon Dryer before but never one like this.  I cannot recommend this product and will not purchase another one of this brand.  It was inexpensive so I guess its true, you get what you pay for.  Not worth paying return shipping so I use it as it is until my new one arrives.
Amazing dryer!! It has cut my drying time down significantly. I have really curly hair & this dryer works very well with my diffuser. I think it is a great value for the money and I'm so happy with my purchase!
Very nice and easy to use.  Works great!
So powerful and light ,for that price it left behind all expensive Italian hairdryers
the quality is very good
Love this dryer especially the cool setting which I use for the first week after I color my hair.  It's lightweight and doesn't make a lot of noise.
Another device that is a powerhouse in a small package.  I had a very expensive white designer hairdresser before this and it still took forever to dry hair, and got so hot doing so that kids and pets yowl.  This dryer works in record time, blows the moisture out like those car dryer things at the car wash, and doesn't burn hair or scalp doing so.  It is also fairly quiet for the power.  I am not a pro hairdresser so can't speak for that, but for the family bath night, it is fast without the  furious.
Product arrived in perfect condition and have had no issues since it arrived.  It was packaged very sustainably and safely. Am very satisfied with customer service.  Totally worth the wait!My girlfriend absolutely loved this as a gift! She said the dryer is powerful enough but not hot enough to damage hair will leaving smooth hair and preventing split ends from fraying from the intense heat of a competitor.  If you have a significant other with delicate hair this is definitely worth the price and wait.  It will pay itself back in no time!I say it's worth the wait because you either have to save up enough money to purchase an item of this caliber and also because it is manufactured in Italy and takes about two weeks to arrive
Great dryer. It dried my hair in under 10 min. And I have thick hair that reaches my bum. Powerful, my leave your hair a little frizzed.
Love having my hair dryer so handy.
As a professional makeup artist and hair stylist I invest in a lot of products. This hair dryer is really not my favorite. I usually hold it by the base when I'm drying a client's hair but it gets so hot that I have to hold it by the handle, but when I do that I'm touching all the buttons and turning stuff on and off on accident. Also, the part that holds the filter on the back of the dryer keeps falling off that I had to tape it and now it looks terrible but it's the only thing that holds the piece on. Not to mention the metal grate on the back that holds the filter in keeps caving in constantly. I feel like these are not meant for travel, which is funny because it's travel size. Maybe I got a bad batch or something.Yes it's a powerful driver, but this seems more like it's aimed at a consumer than a professional which is sad because I had many professionals reccomend it to me. I wouldn't reccomend this to traveling stylists, but maybe it works better if you have your own station.
good quality and lasts a long time...
This hairdryer with the brush attachment works very well for drying and straightening out curly hair. A must for everyone with these extra curls! It's also quite nice to have the availability of the two currents that one might use built into this one unit. It will be great for traveling to Europe.
Can a blow dryer be too powerful?.. the answer is yes.. it is very well made but it is so powerful if drys my hair so fast I can't style it with my round brush for a good blow out.. resulting in frizz that I have to correct with a flat iron.. this was on low setting.. the high setting might as well be a jet engine. . I'm keeping it to use on my poodle because she needs to be dryer quickly.. one major plus though it does not get very hot thus limiting the damage you will do.
Love this hair dryer!
Great buy
Fantastic product and A++ transaction. I use mine evey day. Worth every penny.!!!!
Best and fast
It's fine.  Not much diff between warm and hot settings.  Pretty standard hair dryer.  Dries my hair- that's it.
good! cheap!
Decent hairdryer, but doesn't really help my hair's tendency to frizz. Also don't like the placement of the cool button, I'm always pressing it accidentally. Overall, fine but wouldn't buy again.
Fast shipping. Works wonderful for my curls.  My perm was mostly straight and dead looking and just using this once with the diffuser made my curls come back to life and the dry damaged hair look go away.  I highly recommend this.
Works as intended. No problems. This is replacing another just like it that we had and it lasted 7+ years. Can't ask for much more for a blow dryer in this price range.
Cord doesn't retract all the way
fast delivery great little travel item for me and use it to seal windows plastic liners in winter. Price is excellent.
Great looking hair dryer and works fantastic.
Silent, hot, and lightweight! So far so good. Very pleased at the price top!
I bought this to replace my Conair Infinity Pro hairdryer. What attracted me to this Andis was the salon grade and the ionic/ceramic attributes. Overall this is a good hair dryer, but it doesn't blow as hard as the Conair it replaced. This was HUGE for me, as I like a good air flow. It takes longer for my wife to dry her hair because of it, so we went back to our old brand. It does, however, leave your hair silkier which was a surprise to me. I didn't think an ionic dryer could do that, but it does. The two settings it has for wattage didn't seem to make much of a difference, but it's a nice touch. I'm sure there's a reason for the option, but I can't think of anything it's useful for. I put it on the high setting and let it go. The retractable cord is nice, but it doesn't reel the cord all the way in, leaving about 16in left dangling. After a few weeks of use, it reels in even less, now leaving about 20 or so inches hanging.Pro: Silky hair, somewhat retractable cord, two wattage settings (that I'll prob never use).Con: Takes longer to dry long, thick hair as the air current isn't as strong as I'd like.I wouldn't buy this again or recommend it, but if you don't mind a slightly weaker air flow, the ionic silkiness is worth it.
Return is no longer needed
It only has high and low modes, or off. For the price, the size, and options, it has dried my hair faster than that blue Conair from Target. My hair is dark black, thick in volume, and takes a long time to dry. You can ask all of my hairstylists. So this one is great for your money.
Nice velocity and doesn't get too hot.  Cold button a good feature.
as described
Did not like this at all. My hair took longer to dry and it was so loud!!! Returned immediately
LOVE THIS HAIR DRYER.. DRIES MY HAIR FAST AND LEAVES IT SMOOTH W NO NEED TO IRON IT.. LOVE DIFFERENT TEMP SETTINGS AND DEFINATELY WORTH EVERY PENNY.. MY  STYLIST OWNS THIS SAME ONE AND SAID THEY LAST A VERY VERY LONG TIME. LOVE IT..WOULD DEFINATELY BUY IT AGAIN IF I HAD TO.
Love the air pressure on this dryer!
I would have given this blow dryer a 5, but the cord needs to be longer.  Overall it works great though.
This dryer was purchased last summer and safely stored while we moved. I pulled it out this January, and the low setting has already stopped working, while the high setting barely pushes out any air.  I'm now convinced this was a fake, and am sorely disappointed. Amazon is always our first stop for purchases such as these, and I've always been very happy with their customer service... I have a request for a refund in, and we'll see how this resolves.
I purchased this hair dryer because it was dual voltage, and I wished to use it in both the United Kingdom and France.  It has an American plug, but with a convertor for each country it worked wonderfully!  I could not be happier with this purchase.  Turns out we went to Italy too, and with the same French convertor, the dryer worked in Italy too.
I would recommend this product - compact and powerful - worth for money
works well. Shipping was spot on.
I didn't receive the straightening pic that came with the dryer.
love it love the arrival time as well.
Very short cord, was expecting much longer.
I purchased this from Target a little over three months ago (so, sadly I can't return it) and the heating element has already died. I like the folding and retractable cord features as well as the reasonable price, but it isn't a deal if you have to replace it every three months! I'll spend a little more next time and get a higher quality product.
been using this brand in my bathrooms for years.  easy to install.
It works great.
Curly girls, you're hair will love this. Gives my curls volume without frizz. My hair dries quicker this this dryer, but it is not super hot. The shape of it allows you to shape your air while you dry it. If you have curly hair, get this now! I do wish it had some sort of attachment that was similar to a concentrator so I could blow dry parts of my hair out. You can take off the diffuser attachment but it's not hot enough or concentrated enough to make my hair do what I want for that type of style. I have to use a traditional dryer if I am doing something other than just being curly.
Bought this for limited use to seal windows, having never purchased one before. It worked great.
Premium hair dryer.  Does what the discription said it would.  Light, good looking and not cumbersome.
This is a great item my college age daughter loves it
Awesome
This is not the titanium nano portifino. If it is then it was either used or refurbished and not returned to is original state. It overheats and has damaged my hair because it is not working correctly. I know this because I also own the true black titanium nano portifino and it's an incredible hair dryer and my fiance is a stylist. Disappointed
Arrived before promised.  So far I am happy with the product.
Great just not happy how it cools down when I have it on for 5 minutes.
It works great! The dial for timing it's backwards but it works just fine.
I used to spend six hours doing my girls' naturally coily and kinky hair. Drying time has now been cut to an average if five minutes, which in turns means a styling time of two hours total on the girls. This dryer gave me my weekends back. Only down side is that the ones I've had go out after roughly two years. I'm on my third t3 since 2011.
I have very fine hair and it is not thick, so when I go outside on a humid day, the places where my hair is naturally curly curl up worse and the rest loses the style I intended when I left the house. Static was a big issue, so when shopping for a blower with high wattage, high heat (yes, I want HOT) and high velocity, I found this one hoping it would meet the requirements. I found it to be like most of the drug-store blowers in my blower-graveyard in the closet, going to the next garage sale. I just did not meet the expectations, not enough blow, heat and I still had frizzy static hair. It works and probably works just fine for those who have thick hair they don't want to damage, but my hair takes 2 minutes flat to dry and style. I did move on and purchased Onei MK-II for about $70 taking a really big chance. It blew me away literally and exceeded all expectations. So for fine hair users, it may be worthwhile to shop around since there are very few resources for our types.
Best hair dryer I have ever had.
Startlingly small and flimsy looking, with a thin plastic grill over the fan. But does a decent job, with good air on the high setting. I'd never rely on this for every day or for a long trip, but since it's so light and small, will keep it on hand for overnights.
Works great!
his dryer replaces my old one which is cumbersome and bulkier.  Does a great job.
very compact. Ideal for traveling.
I wanted a salon quality dryer and got it!  This dryer is fast, easy to work with, not too heavy and does a fantastic job.  Best I've ever owned.
great buy
works well, good ppwer, nice size for travel. would recommend it.
good as any other
Great
great value
Was not the red one I wanted, but is sufficient.
I bought this hair dryer for my mother. She is a hair stylist and swears by it. She says it takes up no space and very convenient when mounted on the wall. Works just as good as any other blow dryer she's used. Great space saver.
This dryer is just cheap.  Cheap, lightweight, plasticky feeling.  Granted, it IS all of those things but I have a much nicer travel hair dryer that doesn't feel like it is just going to snap in two...unfortunately my other one doesn't have a diffuser which is the sole reason I got this one.  But hey, it's only for travel...
Cheap blower dryer. It doesn't blow dry very hot air but I did buy it for a good price and it works. This is why I gave it 3 stars.
Small enough to travel but powerful, I like it better than my regular Revlon I was using for 3 years.
I just hate it! I gave away my Babyliss thinking this one is better. What a mistake!!! When I use it my hair gets opaque. I'm very disappointment and is too late to return it.
VERY HEAVY - seems to work well but wouldn't recommend for travel.
Worked great in Germany and the UK.  Just turn the butyon and you are ready for overseas.  Lightweight.  Low setying is powerful.  Highly recommend.
Wife loves it!
As of now no complaints, It's quiet and does the job.
Was looking for a family hair dryer. Got a great deal and works good.  We also like the color.
The weight is inordinately heavy! Why? My old dryer weight was like nothing in comparison.It does the job, but I'd recommend a lighter model to a friend.
The real product is bigger than I expected but it does make your hair look better comparing with other regular dryers. And I love the color!!!
My mom is a cosmetologist & has always supplied me with professional grade dryers for my thick, heavy hair. This one works better than any other professional dryer I have tried. The cost was more reasonable too.
The hair dryer works as expected.
With three teenage girls in the house, the hair dryer gets a lot of use. A LOT OF USE. We've blown through quite a few hairdryers - no pun intended. This one however, seems to be the clear winner. As a stylishly bald man, I can't personally vouch for it, but the female testimonials are unanimous... this is an excellent product.Full disclosure: the dog isn't a big fan, but she doesn't like baths much either, so can'r be surprised.
Great little hair dryer for the money. No cool setting and low speed is really low, but I still like it and would recommend it.
Love, love, love this hair dryer!  I've been looking (and trying) for months now! I finally found the perfect one for me!  YEAH! It's lightweight, small enough to travel and powerful. So easy to use. Economical, too!  I'm going to buy another one for the guest bath!  It's hard to locate great hair dryers when you find one that you like in a hotel. For some reason Conair puts 1875 on most ALL their dryers, so it's hard to tell the actual model number when you find one that you like...  Glad we were finally able to track this one down!
I bought this hairdryer more than year ago when my last one lit on fire. I choose this one because I know the Babyliss name and I loved the pattern. The pattern IS actually as cute as it looks in the picture.Weight: This dryer weighs about as much as a weighted tape dispenser. It feels like a professional hair dryer and is not easy to break.Design: The cord on the dryer is somewhat rigid and unwieldy. It became easier to wrangle when I bought Velcro ties for the cord (On Amazon: VELCRO Brand - ONE-WRAP Thin Self-Gripping Cable Ties: Reusable, Light Duty - 8 x 1/2 Ties, 100 Pack - Black)Speed of drying: I can't say much here. After all, it is just blowing hot air, but I guess that I can say that it dries quickly.Temperature: The hot setting gets pretty hot. Not hot enough to burn your scalp, but hot enough to get the job done.
I love this dryer. I use it as both my everyday dryer and my travel dryer. It's just as powerful as a full-size but without the weight and bulk. I'm seriously never going back to a full-size dryer again.
dryers my hair super fast and no frizz
Just love it , freedom from the hooded dryer !
Works okay, but very heavy!
Good air flow. Fairly quiet. Seems like good construction. Location of the buttons makes them easy to switch unintentionally. I think this is a winner at around twenty six bucks delivered.
great design base could be more sturdy
Great dryer makes my hair feel like silk
Has a good volume of air on high for a compact unit, but the trade-off is it is a bit noisy too.  Not mention in the listing, but the blue button is a cool air button and works as would be expected.  Unlike the Revlon Rvdr5033 I had the cool button on this unit just turns the heat off and back on when released and does not change the fan.  It gets very hot on high and so did the Revlon.  Too hot it seems to me but it appears no one makes a 1500 watt model anymore.  I could find nothing but 1875 watt models even in compact.  Not pictured or mentioned but this one like all of them has the huge block on the cord end with a GFI and AC plug as part of that block.  Even though they tell you not to put two GFI's on the same circuit and there hasn't been a house built in almost 40 years without a GFI covering any outlet in every bathroom the requirement for this still persists.  I like that you can easily take the cover of the fan in the rear for cleaning.  Not many of the compact models seem to have that feature.  Overall a good unit.  Time will tell how durable and long lasting it is.  I can only hope it is as good in that area as the one it replaced.  Update 7/21/15: Well it is NOT very long lasting.  About 4 months in it suddenly started smoking and got very hot very fast did some nice sparking and arcing, then quit.  We will see if they honor the warranty.
Great size and does a good job. The detachable black diffuser piece is extremely hard to get off (at least mine was) so consider whether you will take it off and on often.
I will now be saving money by going less to my hairstylist. This blowdryer dried my hair 2x faster than a previous blowdryer I had.  I wished I had bought this blowdryer years ago!
Best hair dryer I've ever owned.  I'm very happy with the quality of the product.
it didn't fit me , I WAS NOT TALL  TO FIT UNDER IT SO I HAD TO SIT ON A BIG CHAIR COUTON  TO FIT MY HEAD UNDER IT .  I HAD ONE BEFOR THAT THE NECK PART WENT UP OR DOWN AND I though this one did it too .
I've been looking for a good deal on a hair dryer for weeks and finally came across this one. Great purchase.
gave 3 stars because it is advertised as having 2 speeds and 3 heat settings. It does but the heat settings are fixed to certain speeds. You cannot have high speed with low heat or low speed with high heat, only high heat with high speed or low heat with low speed etc. Wanted to control heat and speed separately. Nothing wrong with unit otherwise but lowered rating due to not being able to change heat and speed settings independently. Returned for refund.
Fantastic Hair Dryer
Love it!!!
It is adequate. I do wish the prongs of the diffuser were a more flexible or softer. It kind of hurts our heads.
this is a great little hairdryer - I ordered it for travel.  It's a little heavy and large for a travel dryer but most travel dryers are loud and cheap and take forever to dry your hair.  This one is as powerful as a full size dryer.  If suitcase space isn't an issue, this is the dryer for you.
It dray my hair so quickly. Blow hot air.
Perfect! Small but powerful.
I did not like this blow dryer and returned it.Cons:HEAVY & clunkyair does not get hot, just slightly warmleaves hair looking brittle (not silky & smooth)takes a long time to dry hairrats hair as it dries (I've never had a blow dryer do this before- it's weird)Pros:seems to have powerful airflow
Great product
EXCELLENT
Very good product
The brush attachment doesn't work well through the hair
I was actually looking for something else when I stumbled upon this and thought why not.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  I have fine shoulder length hair and it did not take an hour to dry, as another reviewer stated.  (Of course, I didn't attempt to dry my hair when it is dripping wet either.  I wrap my hair in a towel and do other things for a while before attempting to blow dry.)  Anyway, I was worried at first because the packaging and most of the instructions are in Japanese.  But I used it on the lower voltage and it was fine.  I used the regular brush to dry my hair, as I'm not sure how to use the round brush yet.  I dried most of my hair and then used this upside down to give my hair some lift and bounce, which it did.  Also, my hair does not look frizzy, like it does at times when using a regular blow dryer (I believe because sometimes a regular blow dryer both damages and tends to tangle your hair).  My hair actually looks shiny as well as smooth (as if I flat ironed it).  I would give this a try if you are someone who likes the look of their hair when it is blow dried and/or flat ironed but with what seems much less damage.  I think you could get away with using just this dryer and a little serum (depending on how naturally straight your hair is). I am excited to use this and try to figure out the round brush too.
Works very well thus far.
I am small with shoulder problems and this is very compact and light weight.  It packs a punch with power!
excellent item
Since my hair is too thin, it dries it in a minute! But leaves it so hard frizzy :( it is also very, very loud!!! My duaghter loves it, her hair is long and thick, she does not complain. I did mot return it, my daughter uses it.
Does what its suppose to do, like the ability to clean it.
Very good
Love this hair dryer. Dries my hair in no time
The Nano technology is great. Blow dry is much faster than regular product. Keep my hair style nice (no dryness).
I'm  in love with this hair dryer It's small but really dry's my hair fast and does a wonderful job.
it took me a while to find a blow dryer that actually made it easier to do my hair , usually my hair would still be super fluffy and still kind of tangled after blow drying . I have really kinky curls and after using this my hair was almost straight . I only used a flat iron so it would be sleek but this blow dryer really works . it made my hair shiny and straight and it gets really hot which helps a great deal. I totally recommend this blow dryer to anyone especially if you have kinky curly hair like my self .
I had one before and I love it.  It's off the counter and out of the way.
Works great; looks good on wall.
Dries really fast. I have to use a brush and brush my hair while using this dryer or else it is just an odd mess. I live in area with high humidity off the Gulf coast and my hair stays flat all day! Even straighter than my straight haired friends. I do have to use another dryer when I want to wear my curls because this dryer takes them out.
Works great.
i love the cord keeper Conair dryers.  Much easier to store.  My old Conair cord keeper (less expensive, 2 speed, 2 heat settings) wore out at the plug.  Couldn't be without a blow dryer so looked to trusty Amazon.  I saw this model and read the reviews.  I liked that it had a cool setting and didn't have to keep,the button pushed for the cool shot.  I also like that it has the cord keeper.  But the best feature about it, in my opinion, is that it is MUCH QUIETER than the less expensive model.  I get ready for work in the early mornings and this model produces a moderate hum, compared to the blasting roar the cheaper model makes.  If a quieter blow dryer is what you're looking for, with 1875 power, this is your dryer.  Worth the extra money!!!  Buy it, you won't be sorry!  Super fast delivery!  Ps, use the concentrator nozzle, cuts down on frizz.
Exceeded my expectations.
This hair dryer met all of my expectations. I love its compact design. The bonnet is large enough to fit over rollers, and on the medium heat setting it gets warm enough to dry my hair in 10 minutes. I think it's a quality product with a thoughtful design.
Works great! Night light still works and we've had it over a year!
I have long curly hair 3b. I bought this dyer thinking it would work wonders on my hair. First, I think it does a great job and dries my hair very fast. However, I would prefer to have the teeth longer and better way to cup the hair so to speak. My hair gets caught in the back and ends up with tge burning hair smell. Secondly, I bought this dyer 6 weeks ago and it's already broken. Amazon is amazing and agreed to refund my money. I think this would work better for women with short curly hair more than anything.
Love it. It fits on the wall and it's out of the way. Nite lite is bright also
Bought one of these for a spare bedroom when we have guests. Took a shower in there one day and LOVED this so much I threw mine away and bought one for myself too.
Operates like a very cheap hairdryer. We bought for our 10yr old daughter and it's fine for her. Takes longer to dry hair than most. We may just have a fluke...
The vulcano of hair dryers
EXCELENTE PRODUCTO
Works well but extremely loud.
so far so good.  My husband ordered it, but we both use it.  Have had a similar  one before and used it for years.Hoping this one last as long.
This blow dryer was heavy and too hot.  At the time of purchase this product there were plenty in stock. As soon as I got mine delivered. The product page shows this product is no longer available. Anyway, I returned it and got the Babyliss one. Much happier with the other purchase.
I hope it last long than the one I got last year
This is much lighter than the older model I had and love the different speeds and power.
Great!
Light is too bright
Broke within 2 months.  I would recommend buying a few levels up as I have had those in the past and they do not break.
I love this dryer
Cheap and enough for normal use.
Good Product
I love the smaller size of this hair dryer, which makes it great for travel. At 1875w, it's also still powerful enough to dry my medium-length, thick hair. (If you have thinner or shorter hair, it might be a good idea to dry your hair on the lower setting.) I also really like that this comes with two different diffusers, making it easier to achieve the style I want when drying my hair. This product was provided for testing purposes, but all opinions are my own.
Chose this particular hair dryer after comparing the features with other similar products. I am so glad that I went with this one because it is the best hair dryer I have ever had!! Ever!! I am not even talking about the fact that drying my hair time is cut in half, but what is really amazing that my hair looks so much better. It suddenly has some shine, including the ends that use to look very frizzy. And that is not all. I use round brush  while drying my hair and now that is enough to lift the roots of my hair!. I use to use a product that suppose to help lift the roots and I hated because that product was smelly and It really wasn't doing much , but now this amazing hair dryer makes my hair look healthy and even fuller because of the lift.I LOVE IT!.
As always, the Oster Wall Hair Dryer is convenient and I am satisfied. Although, my previous ones from many years ago were somewhat smaller.
This blow dryer is great . I use it all the time.  Mainly on extensions.  Have not tried it on natural hair (4a-4c) yet.  It should be fine.  Makes drying my hair so much faster and easier
just what I wonted. love it I can move around and sleep in it.
True Story....I have spent approximately $500-$700 on different hair and blow dryers. I have all from the cheap ones to the expensive ones and this is by far the best damn blow/hair dryer I've owned. I am a black woman with natural 4c hair that means thick and coarse and typically when blow drying my hair it feels crunchy but this dryer did not make my hair feel like that. Of course I used the LOC method with Alikay Naturals products before blow drying my hair and it turned out straight like I needed it to be. I'm super happy and satisfied. Also I used the hair pick yo blow dry my hair and it did not pop off nor did I break the teeth in the pick. Dynamite!  If it pick does pop off just use heat resistant double side tape to keep it on.
Excellent and efficient.
I should have read through more of the reviews.  This is definitely NOT the hair dryer you want if you have arthritis. :-(  My husband has no issues and even he thinks it's too heavy.  It blows great.  No complaints there.  Just absolutely not the hair dryer for you if you have small hands or arthritis.
Really good product.
It is good.
wasn't what I expected.  Thought it would have been more powerful.
This is a really neat, compact hair dryer. It dried my shoulder length hair pretty quickly.  I did not use the concentrator nozzle for getting my hair dry, but I did use the thin nozzle with a round brush for styling purposes.  I really liked that this hair dryer has 3 speed settings, 2 heat settings, and a cool shot function.  I used all 3 of these.  The cool shot function is probably my favorite, it really sets your style in place.  The hair dryer is pretty light and the handle is ergonomically designed to feel good in your hand, and it does.  I do have to mention that the first time I used it, there was a distinct burning smell, I was a little concerned about it, but after about a minute or so into use, it stopped and I haven't noticed it again since.  Also, the cord on this hair dryer is THICK, as in it is not going to twist and kink up, it is a quality cord that it going to last a LONG time.  All in all, this is a really good hair dryer,  If you are looking for something on the smaller side, something lightweight, that does a great job quickly, this is a good option.ANEMONE Wind Flower Professional Ionic Ceramic Hair Dryer provided by XTAVA.
I needed a small hair dryer that would fit in a guest bathroom vanity drawer, and this one not only fit but also works well.  With 1875 Watts, it dries even thick hair quickly when used on the high setting.  The handle folds to make it more compact for storage.This is a basic hair dryer wiith only two speeds, high and low, and one temperature unless you hold down the cool button at the top of the handle.  It doesn't have the bells and whistles of more expensive models -- no ceramic coils or diffuser or ionic upgrades.  The handle has a switch to convert from 125 V to 250 V, and you MUST know the voltage of the country you're visiting and manually change the setting or else risk starting a fire.  Remember to change it back when you get home.  A few countries, however, use lower voltages than 125: many Caribbean countries, Japan, Taiwan, and a few South American countries.  Check your destination before you go.  The hair dryer would be completely universal if the power pack handled a range between 100-250 V.  It would also be more useful if it converted automatically the way computer chargers do; however, I've never seen an automatic conversion on a hair dryer.On American current, this is a powerful little hair dryer.  Although most hotels supply hair dryers these days, it works well for those times when either you're not sure you'll find one and when you want to depend on something you know.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
I like it
It works for me well because I have thin hair, if you have thick hair or very long hair, you will spend five hours with it. It works well and is very comfortable.
thanks
I love it's compact design and it perfectly dries my hair within minutes. My 4 star review is due to the concentrator,it fells off atleast once in your 5 minute use which is a pain. If that doesn't bother you then this is the perfect dryer which doesn't occupy a lot of space like other fancy ones.
Great hair dryer. Drys hair quickly and without allot of noise
I have fine hair but A LOT of it and normally takes me over an hour to blow dry my hair.  My hairstylist uses this on my hair and it cuts the drying time in half, so I purchased one to use at home. I don't know what I would do without it!
A must have for any girl! It really has revolutionized hair dryers and I gotta admit I have owned a ton! The drying time is crazy fast! Truly one of my best purchases I have made on amazon! 😉THANKS AMAZON!
I like how big the diffuser head is.
Very happy with this dryer as my last one was getting way too hot and frying my hair.  It's not too heavy nor too loud.  All in all, I would recommend this product!!
This thing has so much power, it will nearly blow the hair right off your head!!!  :)
My previous yellow bird lasted over 12 years.  Great for curly stubborn hair.  A real workhorse!  Product was delivered within 2 days.
Great product.  Cuts dry time in half when compared to other dryers.  Purchased my own and when my daughter borrowed it she loved it so I ordered another for her as a gift.  Great product at a reasonable price.
This dryer made my hair frizzy and rough feeling, not what anyone wants from their blow dryer.  It also felt cheap and was loud, like those terrible blow dryers in hotel rooms.  This was a dud and returned.
Great
Takes 2 hours to dry, but easier to sit under than the hard hat dryers! My hair is thick shoulder length and I use the jumbo pink rollers to set.
Nearly set my hair alight and blew all the sockets in the house!Item RETURNED and refund awaiting! Do not trust it!
This dryer has alot of power,,different heating settings,,,i was just use to one! Well worth the money,,i have looked around and this is cheaper and a better product! Well worth buying
I have extremely thick hair. It typically takes 30 minutes to dry it all. I have been able to dry my hair within 5-10 minutes with this dryer. The concentrator helps reduce frizz from my frizzy hair and makes it easier to straighten. I have yet to use the diffuser but it's amazing overall!!
Size is a little large but it works really well love the retractable cord.
I received this in the mail and it came in a cute box packaged nice and tight.It was shipped in a timely manner and came to me in perfect condition.I love how compact this blow dryer is... I can take it with me when I go on vacation and It wont take up valuable space in my suitcase!!!I have the pink and black one and it is super cute!! I love how stylish it is.It comes with 2 attachments ( diffusers ). one is wider than the other one.They are easy to attach and easy to use. I love to use mine after blow drying my hair without one for a few minutes and then finishing off with the diffuser  leaving my hair shiny and soft.The cord is long enough to be able to set at a table and dry your hair if need be The cord is strong and sturdy so it should last a long time.The dryer itself is very powerful.. I could not believe how hard it actually blows.. it comes with settings so that you can pick the one right for you and your hair..I received this in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and I really think this is a great blow dryer and has a great price!!I will be using this for years to come!!
Nice design and the night light is an added bonus.
This hairdryer lasted maybe two weeks after which time it sounded like something broke internally and was quickly followed by a burning smell.I tried taking it apart to see if I could simply try removing whatever piece had gotten caught in the motor/fan to no avail.Thus, had to trash it.I recommend getting a nicer hairdryer...something in the $30 - $40 range which will last a long time.  This was crap and I should have known better :)
great dryer, and very cheap too!
Love it!  Definitely a salon-style dryer; so much faster on my thick hair than conventional dryers.
Very heavy for a small dryer but quality was great- drys my hair very quickly and packs nicely. I use this as a travel dryer.
This is perfect for curly hair. The difuser piece gets popped in when you receive it and it does not fall out! Its there to stay. I love this product!
I love it!!!
I have had the Remington blow dryer for 5 years but unfortunately I left it at my daughters home.  I have called a few times to get her to ship it back but she keeps forgetting so I bought another.  Love it just as well as my older one and looks the same except for color.  Found out my daughter loved the blow dryer which is why she kept forgetting to mail it back to me.  We both would recommend this hair blower....especially if you have thick hair like we do.  It works great.
This item died after maybe the 10th time i used it. Good thing it is inexpensive. Save your money and dont buy this, keep looking.
installation was easy. Have not used it yet. Not too big or bulky.
Love it. Drys my hair fast and now I can dry with one hand instead of two hands. It gets really hot two. Only use the small comb attachment. I wish it had a thicker brush attachment.
The wattage is great.  However, the heat and fan controls seem to be in the way  on  the handle.  I need to  choke up closer to the heating area so that I don't accidentally move the settings.
When I ordered this hair dryer, I ordered the black with Pink petals. What I received was an all pink hair dryer. I was a little disappointed that I didn't receive the actual hair dryer that I ordered and I believe that the other hair dryer might have been better than this one. I have ordered other hair dryers from Xtava in the past and have been really impressed with the quality and performance of the hair dryers. This hair dryer is nice and small, so it is compact and easily fits even in a drawer. Even though it is small it is a powerful hair dryer and does dry my hair without frizzing it. To me it seemed a little heavy for it being such a small dryer. It was actually louder than my bigger hair dryers. It does have a nice long cord so I am able to move around more and not be confined in standing in one place. It does come with 2 attachments 1 nozzle is long and thin and the other is shorter and wider. It does have 3 heat selections (low, medium and high) and does have 2 speeds (gentle and strong). The feature I like the best about the dryer is the cool air which shoots out a burst of cool air and that is why my hair doesn't frizz when using this dryer. I was able to receive this hair dryer so that I can provide my honest opinion and feedback.
The retractable cord is awesome and the airflow is good. Very nice product.
I was definitely skeptical of paying this much for a hair dryer, especially one with a brand that I have never even heard of making hair dryers.  But the reviews were good so I decided I'd give it a try. I had really high expectations and they were definitely met! I LOVE this hair dryer. I have wavy/curly hair and usually when I blow dry it, it gets really frizzy, this blow dryer gets rid of at least 75% of that friziness, if not more. And the diffuser it comes with is amazing! Another plus, is that it is soooo much quieter than any other blow dryer I've ever had!!
This is absolutely the BEST hand hair dryer I have every had.  I have 4B hair/natural,  and it dries my hair in less time and straight!  You will not go wrong with this
The Anemone wind flower 1875 Blow dryer is amazing!!!  I Love it and so does the rest of my family. It has multiple heat speeds and a cold shot and trust me it gets cool , I put it on cold for me to feel and it was nice:) It dried my hair in a lot less time than most other blow dryers do and it comes with two removable nozzles so that you can dry your hair anyway you want to. I'm still stunned at how fast my hair dried. I have been through so many hair dryers and none of them came close to being this great!! I love the colors of it, the blue and black are perfect for me since that is my favorite colors:)I have long hair, not short so normally it really does take a lot of time to dry my hair. I'm in love with this blow dryer. I love that you have the choice of the colors, they are both really nice looking. This is such a amazing price for such a awesome hair dryer!!! I will end up buying another one just for my daughter to have,so she leaves mine alone:)I received this at little or at no cost to review and to give my unbias opinion and that is exactly what I have done. I wish I could take a picture,but the picture posted is exactly what it looks like:)
Not as powerful on lower power
Heavy, bad temperature and flow control. It is not handy at all.Bay Bliss hair dryer is much better and smaller.
We actually bought this for drying the dog after his baths. He likes it a lot better than the others because it is much quieter on the low speed than what we used before.If you are in a hurry though, the high setting blows a lot of air, just not quite as much as your typical politician.
For the price this is a good drier. It did get a little heavy while I was drying my hair. But I did think my hair looked shinier after. I would not call it professional quality by any means. I would say it is worth it if you're just looking for a good cheap hair dryer.
Why wasn't I using a remington before. These are way better than the one I was using before from Revlon.10 stars.
This works good, but not as good as my old one that I got at Walmart for $15.00.  It's a little heavy and somewhat bulky but I like the fact that the cord recoils inside.  It keeps it out of the way, but the cord is not very long so you must stay close to the outlet.  I have very long hair and my old blow dryer dries my hair a lot faster than this one does. I had no need for the attachements so I tossed them in the trash.  It works OK, nothing to write home about.
Picked this out after using it in a hotel. I've had it in 3 or 4 hotels since then. It has a Medium speed which is rare, and the Cool setting, which I love. And it was reasonably priced!
love it
This hair dryer works well, dries my hair quicker than others I've used in the past. My only complaint is the weight, could be lighter.
Very nice and lighter weight than previous models.  Dries well.
A very good value for the money.  The on/off switch is a little hard for arthritic hands to use, but not a deal breaker.  Dries my wifes curly hair very quickly.
This hairdryer is a definite upgrade from my old Conair one.  It is fast, and seems to leave my hair nice and shiny. My hair still seems a bit frizzy on top, but that could just be my hair or that fact that I live in a very humid climate.  The volume is pretty good.  I don't know if I would necessarily call it quiet though. The weight is also decent, but I would not say it is extremely light or anything. I read on at least one of the other reviews that the power cord was just a regualr plug, but mine was one of those safety kinds.  Overall, it is a great hairdryer for the price!
Love this blowdryer- don't like how the nozzle on the front pops off on it's own, but it has reduced frizz.
Quality hair dryer, this really moves some air.
Great product,looks and preformance.
When we got this hair dryer we wanted one that wouldn't cause fly away hair. This certainly lives up to the claims. Also this dryer has individual controls for speed and heat. I really like that, because most of the time I don't need high heat but do want more blowing power. It also isn't very noisy as far as hair dryers go.
I returned it.
It works great.
these dryers are the best, last forever
Powerful hair dryer--adding volume to your hair. The hot mode could be super hot so you get to be careful.
Best blow dry ever, I have been buying these for years ..
Good product for an amazing price!
Great hair dryer. Dries my hair great for thick hair.
Love it. Perfect for travelling! I used this when I went to Norway last spring. Not only did it work well with the converter, it was also very high powered for such a small dryer.
I had 2 originals of these hair dryers they worked great for years.  I still have one but one the other one broke I reordered this one must have cheaper parts it completely broke in 5 months
I had a cord keeper for years.  This is a nice hair dryer with all the options and attachments I need.  It is a bit larger than my older version.  I will keep looking for one that is lighter weight and smaller.  I really, really liked my older one.
Have it mounted in the not quite finished bathroom yet.  Looks good so far - But haven't used it yet.
This is my second time buying this hair blower. I love it so much!
it doesn't work when I plugged it in it didn't work how do I return it
This is a nice replacement for my old hair dryer.  All 3 attachments work great for however I want to style my hair.  This dryer motor is occasionally  makes a loud grinding sound but it continues to work.
works great.
The biggest waste of money I've ever spent. This drier has to be a fake t3 because I've used a t3 for many years and loved it. This drier however gets hot enough, but there's absolutely no power behind it to blow dry the hair. Essentially it's just barely blowing while heating up my hair. My hair takes forever to dry with this thing and after its finally dry it's a frizzy mess. This company seems dishonest as well because in the box there was a large piece of paper stating that they'll give a lifetime warranty if I give a good review! So they're not standing by their product but instead they're essentially trying to pay me to lie! I'm sorry, but I have to be honest and the drier is a piece of junk.
This dryer is fantastic. Hair is silky and smooth when dry and if you purchase the attachment it does a good job of straightening hair while drying it. I would purchase again.
DO NOT BUY! Lasted 1 Week!- Gets Hot and Quits in less then 3 minutes- needs to cool off then will work for another 3 minutes!Aggravating and not worth  the time to order this product.
I travel frequently and love this hairdryer because the dual voltage allows me to use it anywhere and it is light to handle and small to pack in my luggage.
Does the job. Dries my hair. Not fast, but it also doesn't seem to make my hair like a burnt crisp. So, all good.
It's an ok drier but there are so many better options out there with a stronger motor. The airflow is weak even on the highest setting. It says its a 1875w drier but it dries the hair more like a 1200w one. Also it is quite bulky. It does reduce frizz and improve the shine.I recommend it to a person with short and fine hair. If you have coarse or curly hair, I wouldn't pick this one.
Arrived ahead of schedule, good price.
Small, easy to mount.  Does the job
just what we wanted. size is great and very compact.
Love it and use it daily.  So convenient.
Where has this been my whole life?!?? This is honestly the best hair dryer ever.
Great product I read reviews so kept my unit on low! Wow!  Low gets really hot so it does the job so far woo hoo!!!!!
Bought this item twice. The first unit lasted about two years which I thought was a bit short but it was convenient, worked well and seemed worth a second try. Maybe the one I got just was not a good one. Our use was far from excessive. It was mounted in a master bath where only my wife and I used it. We both have short hair.The second unit I purchased had an additional issue. Though the price was about the same, the cord from the unit base to the wall outlet was significantly shorter than on the first. I guess they saved a few bucks by providing a shorter outlet cord (now about 2-3 fee)t. I accommodated this though the wall setup did not look as tidy as the first unit as I did not have a long enough cord to reach the outlet. The bigger concern is that 2 years later it stopped functioning again.Rather than buy another wall mounted unit, I bought an aluminum generic hair dryer wall mount  and purchased an inexpensive hair dryer than I can easily replace in the future as the need arises.
Very good. Pleasantly surprise
This dryer is awesome, the accessory allows me to pinpoint a section of hair for styling/drying purposes and has a cool setting which sets the style in place, handle does not fold in but luckily I have drawer space.
Excellent!
excellent product, very good at relationship between Quality vs Price, recommended 100%
is kind of different to the picture one, but the stylish on my hair it was as expected
Very powerful for such a small blow dryer.
I gave it one star because there are none lower.  It did not work in Israel even though we had top of the line converters.  In America, it was wimpy and hard to hold.  The voltage switcher on the dryer did not really exist.  Find another one.
Good
Great hairdryer. Powerful but not too heavy and bulky. Like it very much.
Great hairdryer and very quiet!
Broke after 2 uses. But It couldnt be returned because I was in a different country
So far, I like this hair dryer.  It is very strong and has really helped cut down on my dry time.
A gift no feedback from recipient.
Great, love it
Good hairdryer!
Two buttons means you can control the fan speed and temperature -independently- which is a very good thing.  This is a good hair dryer, better than the discount store cheapies--but it is a good price, and good quality too.  Highly recommended.
this is the best!!! works great for hair! annnd my hubby decided to use it to take decals off our truck.... he used it for 4 hrs straight on high heat and i was a bit nervous it would die out on me pretty quick afterward but its 4 mos later and still as good as when i bought it!! very happy with this product!!
This was a birthday present for my long-haired daughter and she loves it.
It dries your hair. Not much else to say.
I had this blow dryer before but i dropped it had to get another one. And i luv it
My wife like the power and size.  I think it is a bit loud.  Easy to mount and it doesn't take up much space.
Great power.  I shouldn't have waited so long to purchase it.  Dries hair more quickly than any other dryer - by far!  Worth the extra money.
My previous dryer finally died.  I really like this one.  It doesn't collapse, but that was one of the breaking points on my previous one.  I like the  variation in temperatures & speed.  I took off the nozzle because it seemed to concentrate the air too much... I don't really like to spend too much time on my hair, just the minimum to make it look good.  The diffuser seems pretty good, but I haven't tried to dry my hair curly yet.  I really like that the back vent can be cleaned.
Great blow dryer definitely better then I was expecting
Bought for a present..was well liked!
Great for traveling. It takes up very little space and weighs next to nothing!
I decided to purchase this hair dryer after using it during a recent hotel stay.  I was drawn to the fact that it does not emanate the same high-pitched tone that my prior Conair makes (which is also an 1875 but has added features such as cool air and turbo settings).  I'm very happy with my purchase.  The hair dryer is VERY lightweight, cheap, and hot enough to get the job done.  Most importantly to me, I don't feel like I'm damaging my hearing when I use it.  I highly recommend it.
Excellent dryer for the price! I've owned Hot Tools and other Conair dryers in the past, and so far this one has been the best. I bought this one to replace my older model Conair dryer that went out after 4 years of use. I really like that this one has the switch for the cool setting, rather than having to hold the blue button to get the cold blast (although it still has that button as an option). It's not as quiet as my last dryer, but my hair gets dryer faster without drying out the ends or creating static. My hair actually looks more shiny/silky after using this one than it did with the older model.
Excellent produce
For the price, this is a great little hairdryer.  Folds nicely.  Wish it had a retractable cord, though.
Nice
Xtava Rimini 1800w Iconic Hair Dryer with Diffuser is awesome! It's light weight, heats up quickly and works wonderfully. The diffuser helps keep hair frizz free and shiny, which is great. There are not only three heat levels, but two power levels, so there are loads of options to get the perfect setting for you!!I am thrilled to have had the opportunity to review this Xtava Hair Dryer. All opinions are my own and not influenced in any way.
Just wish the tube was longer. If your hair is too near the air intake, it sucks it in. Otherwise very good product.
I was in desperate need of a new blow dryer but very hesitant to purchase because I have attempted twice over the years to get a new, updated one but both broke quickly and didn’t work as good as my 15 year old blow dryer. The Xtava Rimini 1500W Ionic Hair Dryer really surprised me. I mean, really. First, it is insanely lightweight (I think they say “ultra-lightweight”). There are 3 heat levels and 2 power levels and it comes with two attachments - a diffuser to help eliminate frizz and give more volume and a Concentrator Nozzle for focusing on just one area of your hair to dry that area more rapidly.Now, for how it performed - I have long, wavy, medium-thickness hair (and lots of it) that tends to get frizzy with heat products (so I limit them!) I generally spend 35-40 minutes to get this hair dried with a blow dryer. This, combined with the fact that I was in a bad car accident and it can get really painful when I am styling my hair for so long means I throw mousse in and let it air-dry wavy/curly more often than not. NOT ANYMORE. I LOVE this hair dryer.It took only 20 minutes to completely dry my hair with the diffuser. And, my hair looked FABULOUS. It made my hair so smooth and soft and with no frizz!!! I didn’t need to use extra smoothing lotions or serums like I usually do! The cool shot button helps to “set” the style and it also helps reduce frizz and boost shine (my old one didn’t have one of these!)I cannot recommend this enough! I wish Amazon wasn’t out of stock so I could purchase one for my sister. She’s always replacing hair dryers too!*I received this product in exchange for an unbiased, honest review.*
Nice and lightweight!
awesome
The best wall mounted dryer I've found!  I also love the little night light as it's enough to light my way to the bathroom at night!
Way better than my previous dryer. I was cheap. I was trying to save money for a while... in the worst ways possible. I ended up buying this $11 dryer because it was cheap.  And for a year, I went around with wet hair. I tried to tell myself that it was okay because of all the money I was saving. But it did not feel okay. I finally ended up getting this dryer though and it was like night and day. This dryer works so quickly. It makes you save time and time is the most precious resource of all. It will dry hair quickly and efficiently.  I do not use any of the attachments that come with it. But if you style your hair, just know, those are options too.
Just with the bonnet was easier to fit over rollers. but otherwise a good machine.
I love the item. It has become very much easier to dry my dreds. Thank you!
I really like this little helper and bought a second one for a friend. I find that my travel sized hairdryer works best in this.
The best dryer ever, I go through hair dryers like crazy, finally I have found one I love!
Perfect size for travel but still really powerful.
Good
its super loud and kind of heavy. I dont really know if i like it. Dont recommend
The voltage switch was broken...could not use it on my trip oversees.  Would not refund me because too much time had passed. Big rip off
I had this hair dryer for approximately seven years before it finally broke. I never used any of the attachments so I can't comment on those, but the blow dryer itself worked great. What finally broke was actually the cord it seems. If you held the cord where it attached to the base at just the right angle it would work again, so the dryer itself was actually still kicking after 7 years.
Love this.
my home use blower. works well!
Looks and works great
Girlfriend likes it. However, doesn't feel as powerful as the previous version
Drys my hair fast and effectively:)
I love it, I have been trying to find one for two years.
i had a professional hair dryer and it broke, i picked this one based on the reviews and the price and i love it. it takes me 15 min to dry my medium hair and it doesnt cause a lot of frizz.
buen producto
I like the silky feel this hair dryer gives my hair.  I bought the same kind to replace an old one.
Great dryer, convenient wall access
This dryer is hard to turn on and off
Great for blowouts!!!
As much as I hate to admit it, in conjunction with the Cricket Technique 400 thermal brush, my hair is as closest to a salon blowout as I have ever gotten it! It feels light and airy like it does when I leave my hairdresser. It is relatively quiet, the design is very nice - I like the smoothness of the handle. Love that it comes with concentrator and diffuser as I use both since I have naturally curly curly hair! I am pleased with this and will update later if need be because I JUST received it in the mail today. I also have long hair and didn't have a problem with the back as some others have.
I looooove looooove this hair dryer.  It's lightweight and has cut my drying time in HALF!
Best hairdryer ever!
I had on of these for 12 years.  It finally gave up the ghost.  Works perfectly and is so convenient to have right on the bathroom wall.  Added bonus - more wattage with the new one!
I like the temperature settings of cool, warm and hot but would like this dryer more if the flow of air were stronger when set on high.  It seems to take longer for my hair to dry with this dryer.
Amazing
WORKS WELL
This hair dryer works super well. I don't find the sound level much different from other hair dryers as some have complained. I appreciate all of the different settings (3 heat settings, Hi/Med/Low power, and teh different Wattage rankings). The concentrater actually stays on the dryer, which is not what I have experienced in the past. Also, the cord retraction is not perfect; it sometimes  leaves an extra 6 inches out, but I actually find it better than other cord retraction models. Since it is a full size blow dryer, I don't expect it to be compact and the additional cord is a non-issue for me. Glad I happened upon this model.
I have had this blowdryer for about a year and it already died.  Ironically, it is the most expensive blow dryer I have ever bought and shortest life as well.  Disappointing...
Best blowdryer ever.  This is my second T3 because the airline broke my first one pitching my luggage. Drys super fast and less damaging.
Love
just prefect for me.
works, retractable cord is nice
I have not had chance to use it allot, but so far so good :)
Great dryer, just a little heavy and...the buttons are very flat, making it hard to slide on and off.
So far works well!
I purchased this for my vacation home.  I liked it so much I brought it home and took the more expensive dryer I was using at home to my vacation home.
As advertised, works great MUCH faster than my precious dryer. The buttons on the handle are a bit awkward but I'll get used to it.
😊
Cons: Too big to be a good travel dryer Not very powerful, even on the highest setting Takes a long time to dry my hair, and itâ€™s super short Does not seem very sturdy  Pros: Relatively quiet Decreases frizz
This unit began to self destruct this morning discharging internal shrapnal and vibrating while releasing a death sound.Despite being treated with the utmost respect it will join the pile of cheap Chinese junk I have accumulated over the yearsIt almost made it to it's second birthday. PitifulI purchased a Panasonic and a seperate wall bracket as a replacementIt is most likely chinese made as well but the design should long outlast generics
I amd black and I have natural hair and I can tell you that this blowdryer will be perfect for anyone!
I got this and was excited because of the reviews. It does dry my hair but takes longer than my drugstore dryer, but might be healthier. The attachments do NOT stay on making them almost useless. I tried to return it but my husband threw away the box, so I'm stuck. I can say it's pretty and I like the cool shot, but it does NOT lock as described....you have to hold it down the whole time. Also, the plug is too narrow. It keeps coming unplugged because it's too loose. It's easy to accidentally change settings or turn it off when in use because of button placement, but starting to get use to it.
NO complaint. It is very powerful for the size.
Was great while it lasted, but the first time I tripped over the cord it toppled over and never worked again...and it had been 90 days, so no refund or exchange.
I like this product
my bathroom looks neater
i bought this as a giftand the person really likes this
My daughter loves
Excellent product. Recommended.
This hairdryer is great!  It has 3 choices of speed and 3 heat settings, cool, warm and hot.  This is the best hairdryer I've ever had!!
It's a hair dryer. I don't think it's horrible, but it's not spectacular, not like some of the other Xtava products I have used in the past. It doesn't look it, but it is lightweight and it's a really nice color blue. It comes with two attachments; a big customized diffuser and a concentrated nozzle for targeting styling. The diffuser was a little difficult to get on. It didn't fit as good as the concentrated nozzle. I also liked that it has a long cord which made it easier for me to move around when needed. This Rimini hair dryer comes with three heat levels, two power levels and a cool shot button to set your style. The different settings and attachments did make it easier when styling my hair. I could set them to what ever I needed them to be, when I needed them. I've never uses such a big diffuser like this before. It did dry my hair quickly, but I have very fine hair, so I don't need a lot of heat. It did help with the frizz and left my hair feeling smooth. I felt that it could have had a bit more power to it, but it was okay. For people with thicker hair, it might take a little longer to dry. Overall, this hair dryer was not bad, it does what a hair dryer is suppose to do and gets the job done. It's very easy to use and with all the different settings and attachments, it's convenient too.Disclosure: I was not financially compensated for this post.

i like
This blow dryer is the first I have owned that truly fits my needs. I have very, VERY curly hair so I am always looking for ways and tools that maky hair maintenance easier. This blow dryer works magic on my hair. It straightens it so fast which really saves me on time. I have small hands so the way this dryer is shaped makes it easy to hold and use. It isn't very heavy which adds to its ease of use.Out of the three attachments, I use the big comb right after washing my hair and the small comb for touch ups. I would say without a good thermal balm, heat protectant, etc... It make be a little freezy. Since my hair is so curly, I am uses to using such products so if you dont, you may want to.The heat dial only has 3 ranges which I thought would be an issue. I would say medium is good for most people. I have never had a problem with not getting the right temperature for my needs.Overall, I am happy with my purchase. It doesnt break the bank yet works better than any other blow dryer I have had. It saves me a lot of time because of how good of a job it does. I would consider this a must buy.
Arrived when it was supposed to. Dries my hair super fast. Nice feel to the dryer. Great price. What more can you ask for?
In the beginning things were fine , I just started using it  2weeks ago even though I bought it months ago. With 2week(3 times a week) of use the thing has already died on me. This is not something, I would buy again. It didn't flat out die , it started declining in performance.
Dries my hair fast
I needed a new hair dryer as my girlfriend borrowed my BaByliss Pro TT.  The Remington works great.  Everything works as it should and it puts out a bunch of air and cools down quickly when you are through using it.  Easy to regulate the temperature and the unit has great fit and finish.  The one item worth noting is that the Remington is about a quarter pound heavier than the BaByliss which may be an issue if you use it for long periods of time.  I highly recommend this hair dryer.
Pretty design, however I didn't notice any difference in lack of frizz or shine that is associated with Ionic dryers.
Very well made. Ergonomics is perfect. It has a dust filter that you can remove and clean out. The plug has a breaker switch. The main power switch is in the handle. This dryer can be used in a salon setting.
Just pyrchased this, but it works well.  Low is hot enough for thin hair.  Med is hor and Hot is super hot!  My old dryer similar to this lasted years.  We'll see about this one.
Great
Love the diverse settings! Does a great job of drying my thick hair quicker than other dryers I have tried.
I am extremely happy that I purchased this hair dryer!  I have lots of fine hair and it dries my hair in about 30-35 minutes.  It does get pretty hot so I suggest a setting around 50 – 55.  It’s very top heavy so heed the directions and secure it somehow.  I do have to say, the first thing my husband said when he saw it was “are you going to the moon?” – as it does look like a space helmet.  The directions are not very clear but I managed to put it together just fine by myself and it’s very sturdy.  I definitely would recommend this dryer.
Dries my extremely thick, long hair quickly.  I use leave-in conditioner, brush out with my Wet Brush and then use the comb attachment to dry.  It takes &#60;10 min.  This is unheard of for me.  Its also fairly quiet.  My friends are sick or hearing about it so, I thought I'd tell Amazonians... I really love this hair dryer!
This is a good hair dryer.  It's the 4th one that I've bought over several years.
Excellent. Small. No negatives.
I love that this comes with a little diffuser. For a little guy, it does a very good job.
exec
The hair dryer is soooo light and can dry my medium to heavy hair in about 5 minutes.  The only negative is that it is kind of large and difficult to store, but besides that, I'd definitely recommend it!
Second one i purchased for wife and daughter
good settings nice flow real smooth
Very compact, easy for travel packing, and works very well. For such  a small dryer, it packs a lot of power, and barely takes much longer than my full size dryer, to to it's job. Folds, and takes up 1/3 the space though, and comes with a cute case, and 2 attachments
Great dryer except that the retractable cord stops completely retracting.  I replaced the first one under warranty after about 9 months.  Within about another 9 months the second dryer's retractable cord would not retract completely.  I followed the directions as to how to retract the cord.  The warranty only covers 12 months from original purchase date so I am now out of luck as far as getting a new one.
Better than any hair dryer I have had. Great product.
It has several heat settings and several speeds.  The options are great!
Works great.
I read all the great reviews and decided to give it a try. I was a little disappointed. It takes a little longer to dry instead of the faster way the review mentioned. It is also not as hot as my regular cheaper blower.
Works like it should.
Looks great, works great, cord isn't too short (a pet peeve), and I love that it has more than 2 settings like many dryers these days. I can even give my dogs a little help drying off in the winter since I can change up the settings the moment it's a bit too hot or cool without going too far the opposite direction. Really liking the product so far. For me, Conair has always delivered.
Definetely this hair dryer sucks, it did not last not even 30 days. I only used once a day, & it got burned out. I regret not to pay attention to the bad reviews which they were saying the thruth.
Great product. Have used similar dryer for 20 years in 2 bathrooms. This model seems quieter but still has the power.
Love it! Small but powerful!
I like it
Love this dryer! Looks sharp, cut my hair drying time in half!
Good value, great price!
this has met all my expectations.  very happy with product
She loves it. It performs better than expected. Congrats on selling a GREAT product and thanks for asking.
First Amazon Review... So I bought this hair dryer as my main hairdryer at home. I typically use the WARM setting. Overall, great finish and works very well. Despite me using the warm (not hot) setting, the thin film of plastic over the barrel and handle slowly started to peel off. Not a big deal, but definitely worth noting, in case that bothers you. It's doesn't look so pretty now, and I've had it for about a year.Overall, great value for the money and excellent results, but the packaging I'd give a 4/10, they could have done better.
